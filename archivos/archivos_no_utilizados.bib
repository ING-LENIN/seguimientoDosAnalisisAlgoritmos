N2 - Scratch, a visual programming language, was used in many studies in computer science education. Most of them reported positive results by integrating Scratch into K-12 computer courses. However, the object-oriented concept, one of the important computational thinking skills, is not represented well in Scratch. Alice, another visual programming language, seems to have better illustration of the object-oriented concept for programming novices. To demonstrate effects of Alice and Scratch, we compared students’ responses to both visual programming languages, especially for students with low performances, in an introductory programming course. The relationships among learning engagement, learning anxiety, and learning playfulness were explored. The results could be referred to by computer science instructors to select proper visual programming language for corrective instruction.

N2 - Courses on computer programming are included in the curricula of almost all engineering disciplines. We surveyed the research literature and identified the techniques that are commonly used by instructors for teaching these courses. We observed that visual programming and game-based learning can enhance computational thinking and problem-solving skills in students and may be used to introduce them to programming. Robot programming may be used to attract students to programming, but the success of this technique is subjected to the availability of robots. Pair and collaborative programming allows students to learn from one another and write efficient programs. Assessment systems help instructors in evaluating programs written by students and provide them with timely feedback. Furthermore, an analysis of citations showed that Scratch is the most researched tool for teaching programming. We discuss how these techniques may be used to teach introductory courses, advanced courses, and massive open online courses on programming.

N2 - Research on ‘digital’ journalism has focused largely on online news, with comparatively less interest in the longer-term implications of software and computational technologies. Drawing upon a 6-year study of the Toronto Star, this article provides an account of TOPS, an in-house web content management system which served as the backbone of thestar.com for 6 years. For some, TOPS was a successful software innovation, while for others, a strategic digital ‘property’. But for most journalists, it was slow, deficient in functionality, aesthetically unappealing and cumbersome. Although several organizational factors can explain TOPS’ obstinacy, I argue for particular attention to the complex ontology of software. Based on an outline of this ontology, I suggest software be taken seriously as an object of journalism, which implies acknowledging its partial autonomy from human use or authorization, accounting for its ability to mutate indefinitely and analysing its capacity to encourage forms of ‘computational thinking’.

N2 - Programming and computational thinking have emerged as compulsory skills in elementary school education. In 2018, Sweden has integrated programming in mathematics education with the rationale that it fosters problem solving and logical thinking skills and motivates students to learn mathematics. We investigated how teachers introduce programming in mathematics education in a Swedish primary school using an explorative case study. We followed four mathematics teachers during the first semester in which programming was mandatory. They taught second-, sixth- and ninth-grade students. Our contributions are threefold: we provide an account of how programming is taught in mathematics education; we discuss how teachers reflect on the challenge of teaching programming in mathematics; and we report on students’ understanding of programming and their view on the relationship between programming and mathematics.

N2 - This article proposes thinking of media archaeology as an operating table upon which historical, material and technological interconnections between fashion and film are made. By exploring how early cinema and digital film can be coupled to textile as technology, more specifically through the mechanisms of the sewing machine and the Jacquard loom, it extends the historical span from the mid-1890s, with the invention of cinema as projection, to the early 1800s, when computational thinking was successfully implemented as weaving technique. Instead of focusing on film and fashion as means of visual representation, the author relies on the concept of inscription for a better understanding of both cinema (as recording of light and movement) and textile (with its various thread techniques of weaving, stitching, knitting, etc.).

N2 - Computer programming has been gradually emphasized in recent computer literacy education and regarded as a requirement for all middle school students in some countries. To understand young students’ perceptions about their own learning in computer programming, this study aimed to develop an instrument, Computer Programming Self-Efficacy Scale (CPSES), for all students above middle school levels. Based on Berland and Lee’s computational thinking framework, this study developed the CPSES items at a literacy level and finally the instrument included the five subscales: Logical Thinking, Algorithm, Debug, Control, and Cooperation. An exploratory factor analysis and reliability tests were conducted in this study. The reliability alpha was .96 for the overall scale, and ranged from .84 to .96 for the subscales. This study also confirmed the positive correlation between computer programming experience and computer programming self-efficacy. In addition, for low- and middle-experienced learners, significant gender differences were found in two subscales: Algorithm and Debug. The CPSES can be applied as an evaluation tool in computer education, robotics education, as well as integrated STEM or STEAM education in which computer programming was regarded as a part of computer literacy.

N2 - Parquet Deformation is an architectural studio exercise introduced by William Huff in 1960s. It aims to improve students’ reasoning of spatiotemporal variation by utilizing sequential shapeshifting of patterns. This article examines the outcomes of this educational research from a perspective of design computing with a purpose to remark its pedagogical significance. A multilayered reading about the exercise will reveal its historical, theoretical, and artistic backgrounds. Then the common structural elements and different construction approaches are explained along with a novel design and analysis method. The proposed method embeds variations of two-dimensional pattern deformations on a third dimension. It enables various analyses such as the measurement of regularity and locating the attractor points. This study is expected to exemplify how computational thinking and new digital tools change the way designers would approach to such systematic compositions.

N2 - This article examines the articulation of computational journalism, focusing on how the meaning of the computational is discursively constructed and mobilized as a specific constellation of intelligibility within news organizations. Relying on the concept of articulation developed in cultural studies, the article asks what, exactly, is meant by the computational in the context of journalism? Drawing on interviews with key managerial staff, editors and developers at Scandinavian news organizations, three broad claims about the linkage between the computational and journalism emerged. These articulations include the notion that machines don’t have instincts, that democracy can never be personalized and finally that the computational is something to think with, rather than simulate. The argument is made that what can and cannot be calculated is not merely a technical question, it is also a deeply social, cultural, political and economic one. Thus, the computational emerges as an important organising framework and discursive order for thinking and talking about journalism in the digital age.

N2 - The sports statistics community is rapidly evolving. R is an open-source software in constant development that has gained a lot of popularity within statistical communities and sports analytics. This work presents a systematic review of the available R CRAN sport packages following PRISMA guidelines. We consider all packages active as of 18 February 2021. A total of 81 sport R packages created since 2006 were detected. Of these, 35.9% were authored by an American national, 69.1% include a dataset, 43.2% provide vignettes, and 65.4% have been updated at least once. The sport with the highest representation is basketball (n = 14, 17.3%), followed by soccer (n = 12, 14.8%) and packages related to physical activity (n = 11, 13.6%). There are no sports packages directed solely for the female gender, while 59.3% of packages are focused on professional athletes. Fifty packages (61.7%) are related to the sports performance analysis category, and web scraping (n = 43, 53.1%) was the main functionality in the collected packages. The creation of new R packages in the area of sports could help solve questions and tasks that still remain a challenge in this field, while continuing to help to improve the level of statistical education and computational thinking skills.

N2 - This study explored how Australian music technology courses teach employability skills. A curriculum mapping of 63 undergraduate courses was conducted with course learning outcomes aligned against two benchmarks. The first benchmark was the Ten Skills for the Future Workforce which identifies key employability skills graduates will require in the coming decade. The second benchmark was the Australian Qualifications Framework Specification for the Bachelor Degree which defines the generic skills graduates must obtain through Australian Bachelor Degrees. This curriculum mapping reveals that Australian music technology courses teach Novel and Adaptive Thinking, Computational Thinking, New Media Literacy, and Design Mindsets universally. However, this curriculum mapping also reveals a deficit in employability skills related to Cross-Cultural Competency, Transdisciplinarity, Virtual Collaboration, and Collaboration more generally. The implications of this mapping is that Australian music technology educators seem to be prioritizing specific technical and creative skills over higher-order applications of skills and knowledge which are contextualized in their broader social and cultural contexts. Finally, this article shows how curriculum mapping can be implemented to embed employability skills progressively across a program sequence using a case study from the School of Music, University of Queensland.

N2 - Reintroducing computer science (CS) education in K–12 schools to promote computational thinking (CT) has attracted significant attention among scholars and educators. Among the several essential components included in CS and CT education, program debugging is an indispensable skill. However, debugging teaching has often been overlooked in K–12 contexts, and relevant empirical studies are lacking in the literature. Moreover, novices generally have poor performance in domain knowledge and strategic knowledge concerning debugging. They also consistently experience a high cognitive burden in debugging learning. To address these gaps, we developed a flipped systematic debugging approach combined with a systematic debugging process (SDP) and the modeling method. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to explore the effectiveness of this flipped systematic debugging approach, in which 83 fifth-grade students attended the flipped debugging training lessons with the SDP–modeling method, and 75 fifth-grade students attended the unassisted flipped debugging training lessons without the SDP–modeling method. The results indicated that flipped debugging training using the SDP–modeling method improved students’ debugging skills. The results from the questionnaire showed that the proposed teaching approach increased the students’ investment in germane cognitive load by promoting schema construction. It also helped reduce students’ intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load in learning.

N2 - This article investigates a rapidly expanding branch of journalism innovation in online news media. The umbrella term computational exploration in journalism (CEJ), embraces the multifaceted development of algorithms, data, and social science methods in reporting and storytelling. CEJ typically involves the journalistic co-creation of quantitative news projects that transcend geographical, disciplinary, and linguistic boundaries. Drawing on extensive empirical data, this article provides a conceptual overview of the field by identifying three main pathways of computational exploration in journalism: the newsroom approach, the academic approach, and the entrepreneurial approach. Implications for changing journalistic practice are discussed, and the theorizing is summed up in a triplex proposition about changing mindset processes coming out of CEJ. The study indicates that the computational exploration not only leads to innovative uses of the technology, but also to innovative ways for journalists to think and behave; journalism innovation leads to innovation journalism.

N2 - Libraries as social spaces are bound to evolve based on a society’s level of civilisation and information media. This paper argues that the emergence of smart libraries have changed the paradigms of library by acknowledging the potential benefits and transformation smart library brings to library operations and services. It notes that analytical and computational thinking, data literacy, information literacy, social intelligence, programs and project management, cross-cultural competency, transliteracy, transdisciplinary, design thinking and mindset, virtual collaboration and cognitive load management are skills to be possessed by smart librarians. It highlights cloud computing, big data, 3D printing, IoT, Artificial Intelligence, RFID, drones etc., as the emerging technologies used for smart libraries and further discusses smart services, smart people, smart places and smart governance as the dimensions of smart library. Revelations are further made that smart libraries aid space saving, expansion of library working hours and services and promotes access to information, while remarks are made that lack of technological know-how, technophobia, data privacy and security, etc., are the challenges of smart library. It concludes that the emergence of smart library have facilitated the redefinition of library services and operations and recommends amongst others that librarians should continuously update their skills so that they can meet up with competitions that may arise from the challenges of globalisation of the information landscape.

N2 - The combination of the quantitative turn in linguistics and the emergence of text analytics has created a demand for new methodological skills among linguists and data scientists. This paper introduces KNIME as a low-code programming platform for linguists interested in learning text analytic methods, while highlighting the considerations necessary from a linguistics standpoint for data scientists. Examples from an Open Educational Resource created for the DiMPAH project are used to demonstrate KNIME’s value as a low-code option for text analysis, using sentiment analysis and topic modelling as examples. The paper provides detailed step-by-step descriptions of the workflows for both methods, showcasing how these methods can be applied without writing code. The results suggest that visual or low-code programming tools are useful as an introduction for linguists and humanities scholars who wish to gain an understanding of text analytic workflows and computational thinking. However, as with more traditional programming, caution must be exercised when using methods without fully understanding them. In conclusion, KNIME is a potential avenue for innovative research and teaching computational methods to humanities scholars.

N2 - This study explored how Australian music technology courses teach employability skills. A curriculum mapping of 63 undergraduate courses was conducted with course learning outcomes aligned against two benchmarks. The first benchmark was the Ten Skills for the Future Workforce which identifies key employability skills graduates will require in the coming decade. The second benchmark was the Australian Qualifications Framework Specification for the Bachelor Degree which defines the generic skills graduates must obtain through Australian Bachelor Degrees. This curriculum mapping reveals that Australian music technology courses teach Novel and Adaptive Thinking, Computational Thinking, New Media Literacy, and Design Mindsets universally. However, this curriculum mapping also reveals a deficit in employability skills related to Cross-Cultural Competency, Transdisciplinarity, Virtual Collaboration, and Collaboration more generally. The implications of this mapping is that Australian music technology educators seem to be prioritizing specific technical and creative skills over higher-order applications of skills and knowledge which are contextualized in their broader social and cultural contexts. Finally, this article shows how curriculum mapping can be implemented to embed employability skills progressively across a program sequence using a case study from the School of Music, University of Queensland.

N2 - Set in English Language Arts, this article takes up recent trends in literacy toward investigating ontological notions of digital texts. Two teacher educators recently implemented a series of readings and activities in their methods courses designed to help preservice teachers sophisticate their conceptions of texts beyond autonomous, neutral collections of information by considering digital age ideas such as software theory, textual ideology, and the algorithmic bias of the Internet. The authors review recent scholarship surrounding the integration of computational thinking and the humanities before illustrating a theoretical framework that combines software-driven interpretation and critical media literacy. Descriptions and applications of course texts and exercises precede a discussion on typological methodology. Through the analysis of semester-long writing reflections and course interactions, a typology of preservice teachers is then presented, illustrating three archetypes: Strategists, Hawkeyes, and Improvers. These archetypes are taken up to analyze the ways in which a range of teacher candidates considered ontological notions of digital texts to analyze instructional techniques, to sharpen their critical lenses, or to gain greater understanding of ELA as a discipline (or some combination of all three). This work demonstrates that as teacher educators and teacher candidates increasingly consider software-powered literacies, interrogations of who we are, who we are becoming, and what it all means requires attention to, and explicit practice with, the dark side of digital texts.

N2 - Deeper learning (DL) is firmly rooted in learning science and computer science. However, a dearth of review studies has probed its trajectory in DL in foreign languages(DLFL). Utilizing SSCI from the Web of Science Core Collection, we employ Citespace and Vosviewer to analyze the scientific knowledge graph of DLFL literature. Our analysis elucidates its geographical spread over time, highlights critical areas for further research, and identifies current trends in its evolution. The results show that DLFL research advances with the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Australia ranking in the top five in terms of the number of articles published; the research hotspots focus on factors influencing DLFL, learners’ cognitive processes through language acquisition and information technology intervention in DLFL. The field of DLFL pertains to learning science, which is dedicated to enhancing learners’ performance, while computer science emphasizes utilizing advanced educational technologies as intervention tools. From learning science to computer science, both fields have followed distinct paths in their respective developments with a trend of integration, and the latter provided the former with a continuous supply of technology-mediated educational tools, including the future uses of computational thinking and ChatGPTs. As for future research directions, the development trajectory of DLFL will focus on natural language processing, cognitive neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. The findings will offer insights for future research on DLFL by enhancing the informational and computational literacy of both instructors and learners, empowering them to navigate and leverage the transformative potential of DLFL.

N2 - Active student engagement, teaching via experience in real-life settings and learning by doing, are pedagogical strategies appropriate to improve student-reasoning skills. By building models, performing investigations, examining and explaining experimental results, using theoretical and computational thinking, constructing representations, undergraduates can acquire a deeper understanding of fundamental disciplinary concepts while reinforcing transversal abilities. In this framework, Engineering courses should be designed with the final objective to develop practical skills, focusing on hands-on activities. This contribution presents two different inquiry-based learning environments recently experienced at the University of Palermo in the context of bioelectronic and biomedical Engineering. The first study describes a laboratory activity about digital ophthalmologic signal classification; the second laboratory focuses on the analysis of the prefrontal cortex activation during a memory task using functional Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (fNIRS). We introduce and discuss the learning workshops, with the research objective of improving current instruction and training in Engineering courses. Indeed, this contribution aims to suggest a conceptual framework in the form of a structured elective suite of modules tailored to meet the needs of Engineering graduates. The outcomes of both studies seem to highlight that self-directed learning activities could enhance students’ enthusiasm to learn and engagement in engineering investigations, contributing to improve the achievements of students and acquire a more effective learning approach.

N2 - This paper explores how mechanical and aerospace engineering (MAE) students understand and improve their data proficiency throughout their engineering curriculum. Data is essential for engineering students to be proficient in handling, as it is involved in every aspect of engineering. With the growing ubiquity of data and data analysis in all engineering fields, engineering students need to learn and master data skills to be competitive in the current and future job market. However, there is a lack of research on how non-computer science or software engineering majors perceive data proficiency and how they seek opportunities to develop data skills, especially as it relates to specific subdomains. In this paper, we investigate how students perceive data proficiency and how they develop using interview data from N = 27 MAE students at a research institution in the southeastern United States. Using the How People Learn framework, we analyzed the data through thematic analysis methods with a postpositivist approach, considering the bounded context of this study. The results show that MAE students value data proficiency as a crucial skill for their future careers and recognize its importance in making evidence-based engineering decisions. The study also reveals that, even though data proficiency is often a “hidden competency,” MAE students intuitively find various ways to enhance their data skills. These findings may help engineering educators to tailor their instruction to their students’ needs, address misconceptions about data and data proficiency, and prepare a data-literate future engineering workforce.

N2 - This study critically reviews sixteen empirical studies that investigate the various difficulties that primary school students encounter while learning programming through educational games. Specifically, the challenges that students face in understanding basic programming concepts and the game elements that contribute to these difficulties, as well as the extent to which students can transfer the knowledge gained to contexts beyond games are analyzed. The results indicate that students primarily struggle with understanding loops (both simple and nested), while difficulties with selection structures and sequence structures are less pronounced. Regarding game elements, students face difficulties in interpreting command symbols representing directions, understanding graphical interface elements representing programming constructs, and managing complex user interfaces. The results imply a need for further empirical studies to explore how well students can apply their acquired programming knowledge to contexts beyond games. Although the need for further research is highlighted, the findings of the study provide valuable implications both to educators and game designers for a more effective incorporation of educational games to the teaching of programming, and a more straightforward depiction of programming concepts and a more user-friendly graphical user interface respectively.

N2 - The ever-increasing computational requirements of HPC and service provider applications are becoming a great challenge for hardware and software designers. These requirements are reaching levels where the isolated development on either computational field is not enough to deal with such challenge. A holistic view of the computational thinking is therefore the only way to success in real scenarios. However, this is not a trivial task as it requires, among others, of hardware–software codesign. In the hardware side, most high-throughput computers are designed aiming for heterogeneity, where accelerators (e.g. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.) are connected through high-bandwidth bus, such as PCI-Express, to the host CPUs. Applications, either via programmers, compilers, or runtime, should orchestrate data movement, synchronization, and so on among devices with different compute and memory capabilities. This increases the programming complexity and it may reduce the overall application performance. This article evaluates different offloading strategies to leverage heterogeneous systems, based on several cards with the first-generation Xeon Phi coprocessors (Knights Corner). We use a 11-point 3-D Stencil kernel that models heat dissipation as a case study. Our results reveal substantial performance improvements when using several accelerator cards. Additionally, we show that computing of an approximate result by reducing the communication overhead can yield 23% performance gains for double-precision data sets.

N2 - As visions of smart urbanism gain traction around the world, it is crucial that we question the benefits that an increasingly technologised urbanity promise. It is not about the technology, but bettering peoples’ lives, insist smart city advocates. In this paper, I question the progressive potential of the smart city drawing on the case of Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative. Using the case studies of the smart home and ‘learning to code’ movement, I highlight the limits of such ‘smart’ interventions as they are stunted by the neoliberal-developmental logics of the state, thereby facilitating authoritarian consolidation in Singapore. As such, this paper distinguishes itself from previous works on the neoliberal smart city by situated smart urbanism within the socio-political dynamics of neoliberalism-as-developmental strategy. For smart urbanism to better peoples’ everyday lives, technological ‘solutionism’ needs to be replaced with more human-centric framings and understandings of urban challenges.

N2 - Traditional harmonic analysis annotations can be represented in a computer model of a piece of music by plain text strings. But whenever automated processing like analysis, comparison or retrieval is intended, a formal definition is helpful. This should cover not only the syntactic structure, but also the semantics, i.e. the intended meaning, and thus adheres to the technique of mathematical remodelling of existing cultural phenomena. The resulting models can serve as a basis for automated processing, but also help to clarify the communication and discussion among humans substantially. This article proposes such a definition in four layers, which address different problems of encoding and communication: (a) relation of symbol sequences to staff positions, (b) combining functions, (c) chord roots, and (d) interval structure and voice leading. Only one of them is specific to functional (Riemannian) theory and can possibly be replaced to represent scale degree theory. The proposal is configurable to different interval specification methods and open to localisation. Syntax and semantics are defined by precise mathematical means, borrowed from computer science, and thus are unambiguously documented.

N2 - The recent shift in compulsory education from ICT-focused computing curricula to informatics, digital literacy and computer science, has resulted in children being taught computing using block-based programming tools such as Scratch, with teaching that is often limited by school resources and teacher expertise. Even without these limitations, Scratch users often produce code with ‘code smells’ such as duplicate blocks and long scripts which impact how they understand and debug projects. These code smells can be removed using procedural abstraction, an important concept in computer science rarely taught to this age group. This article describes the design of a novel educational block-based programming game, Pirate Plunder, which concentrates on how procedural abstraction is introduced and reinforced. The article then reports an extended evaluation to measure the game’s efficacy with children aged 10 and 11, finding that children who played the game were then able to use procedural abstraction in Scratch. The article then uses game analytics to explore why the game was effective and gives three recommendations for educational game design based on this research: using learning trajectories and restrictive success conditions to introduce complex content, increasing learner investment through customisable avatars and suggestions for improving the evaluations of educational games.

N2 - Background: There has been a dearth of research on intersectional identities in STEM, including the fields of computing and engineering. In computing education research, much work has been done on broadening participation, but there has been little investigation into how the field of computer science (CS) presents opportunities for students with strong intersectional identities. This study explores the strengths and connections among the unique identities and the symbiotic relationships that elementary Latina students hold in CS identity attainment. Purpose: The aim of this article is to better understand how predominantly low-income, multilingual Latina students experience identity development through the lens of diverse group membership. We examine how young Latinas, through their participation in a yearlong culturally and linguistically responsive CS curriculum, leverage their intersecting identities to rewrite the formula of what a computer scientist is and can be, leaving space to include and invite other strong identities as well. Research Design: An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used that analyzed data from predominantly low-income, multilingual Latinas in upper elementary grades, including pre- and post-CS identity surveys (N = 50) delivered before and after implementation of the curriculum, and eight individual semi-structured student interviews. Findings: We found that Latina students developed significantly stronger identification with the field of CS from the beginning to the end of the school year with regard to their experiences with CS, perception of themselves as computer scientists, family support for CS and school, and friend support for CS and school. Interviews revealed that perception of their CS ability greatly influenced identification with CS and that girls’ self-perceptions stemmed from their school, cultural, and home learning environments. Conclusion: Our results highlight the wealth of resources that Latinas bring to the classroom through their home- and community-based assets, which are characterized by intersecting group membership. Students did not report on the intersection between language and CS identity development, which warrants further investigation.

N2 - To explore the role of design thinking in contemporary computer literacy education, this study aimed to examine the relationship between young students’ design thinking disposition and their computer programming self-efficacy. To assess students’ design thinking disposition, this study developed the Design Thinking Disposition Scale (DTDS) with a sample of 350 junior high school students who had computer programming experience in a STEAM course. A principle axis factor analysis with the promax rotation method was used to verify the DTDS’s construct under the four dimensions: empathize, define, ideate and prototype. The Cronbach’s alpha reliability was .90 for the overall scale. Correlation analyses results showed that all the four dimensions were significantly correlated with computer programming self-efficacy assessed by CPSES. A significant regression model was found in which the three factors, ideate, prototype and define, significantly predicted the overall computer programming self-efficacy. Meanwhile, except for the ideate subscale, no gender difference was found in the young students’ design thinking dispositions. The students’ self-directed programming learning experience was shown to benefit their design thinking disposition. The DTDS can be applied to design-thinking-embedded computer literacy curricula such as makers, STEAM, or robotics education. Several further studies are also suggested.

N2 - Computational thinking (CT) is a set of cognitive skills that every child should acquire. K–12 classrooms are expected to provide students opportunities (tasks) to think computationally. We introduce a CT competency assessment for middle school students. The assessment design process started by establishing a cognitive model of CT domain mastery, in which three broad skill types were identified to represent CT competency. After multiple-choice item prototypes were written, pilot tested, and revised, 15 of them were finally selected to be administered to 564 students in two middle schools in the Midwestern United States. Using a cognitive diagnostic scoring model, mastery classifications for each student were determined that can be used diagnostically by teachers as a pretest and, perhaps in the future, to compare the outcomes of CT instructional programs. The results inform an initial understanding of typical learning progressions in CT at the middle school level.

N2 - Most studies suggest that students develop computational thinking (CT) through learning programming. However, when the target of CT is decoupled from programming, emerging evidence challenges the assertion of CT transferability from programming. In this study, CT was operationalized in everyday problem-solving contexts in a learning experiment (n = 59) that investigated whether learning programming enhances students’ CT skills. Specifically, this study examined the influence of a novel, systematic and micro instructional strategy that is grounded in abstraction and comprised of four independent but related processes – discover, extract, create, and assemble (DECA) towards simplification of problem-solving. Subsidiary questions explored the effects of students’ age, gender, computer proficiency, and prior programming experience on the development of CT. No significant difference was found between the CT skill and programming knowledge of the groups at the posttest. However, within-group paired t-tests showed that the experimental group that integrated DECA had significant improvement in CT but not in the control group across the pretest-posttest axis. Implications of the inconclusive finding about the transfer of programming skills to CT are emphasized and the arguments for disentangling CT from programming are highlighted.

N2 - Computational thinking (CT) has attracted significant interest among many educators around the globe. Despite this growing interest, research on CT and programming education in elementary school remains at an initial stage. Many relevant studies have adopted only one type of method to assess students’ CT, which may lead to an incomplete view of student development on CT, while other studies employed small sample sizes, which may increase the chance of assuming a false premise to be true. Moreover, conventional programming courses typically have two limitations (e.g., limited student active learning and student low engagement). Given these gaps, this study investigates the effects of a theory-based (5E framework) flipped classroom model (FCM) on elementary school students’ understanding of CT concepts, computational problem-solving performance, and perceptions of flipped learning. To achieve this, a pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study was conducted in a rural elementary school, including 125 students in the experimental group and 122 students in the control group. The results showed that the 5E-based FCM significantly improved student understanding of CT concepts and computational problem-solving abilities. The results also revealed positive student perception toward the FCM. The benefits and challenges of the 5E-based FCM are discussed.

N2 - Jeannette Wing’s influential article on computational thinking 6 years ago argued for adding this new competency to every child’s analytical ability as a vital ingredient of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) learning. What is computational thinking? Why did this article resonate with so many and serve as a rallying cry for educators, education researchers, and policy makers? How have they interpreted Wing’s definition, and what advances have been made since Wing’s article was published? This article frames the current state of discourse on computational thinking in K–12 education by examining mostly recently published academic literature that uses Wing’s article as a springboard, identifies gaps in research, and articulates priorities for future inquiries.

N2 - Background In today’s world, acquiring essential skills is crucial for empowering individuals, particularly children, to handle everyday challenges and tasks in a technologically advanced society. Among these skills, computational thinking (CT) plays a vital role in problem-solving and adapting to the complex and evolving demands of the 21st century. However, it is necessary to explore the role of other thinking skills alongside CT, considering that CT cannot be improved and applied in isolation. Objective This paper aims to address the gap in knowledge regarding the application of systems thinking to CT development and its integration into education settings. Methods Results from two studies, focusing on CT development using educational robotics and maker technologies, form the basis of this paper. The research findings are synthesized and consolidated using the systemic FMA (framework of ideas, methodology, and area of concern) model. Results The research findings illustrate that utilizing a diverse set of approaches, methods, and tools can improve CT skill development across different educational settings. Conclusions The adapted FMA model promotes methodological pluralism and facilitates a critical examination of CT development boundaries, leading to both conceptual and practical changes. This approach enables the recognition of emergent properties, the design of interventions, and the incorporation of multiple perspectives.

N2 - In this research, a scale was developed to determine the programming-oriented computational thinking skills of university students. The participants were 360 students studying in various departments at different universities in Turkey for computer programming. The scale consists of 33 items under conceptual knowledge, algorithmic thinking, and evaluation subscale. While there was no significant difference between the students’ conceptual knowledge and algorithmic thinking skills, the evaluation skills of male students differed significantly compared to females. Programming experience has a significant effect on conceptual knowledge, algorithmic thinking, and evaluation. The algorithmic thinking skills of the students who have low, middle, and high-level programming experience differed significantly. In terms of the development of conceptual knowledge and evaluation skills, it was observed that students should have at least one year of programming experience, but this experience will not make a significant difference if it is four years or more. It is thought that this scale, which is structured for different applications (e.g., web, game, robot) and learning environments (e.g., text, block) within the framework of its programming capabilities (conceptual, semantic, strategic knowledge), will contribute significantly to the evaluation of computational thinking as programming oriented.

N2 - Recently educational robotics has expanded into curriculum beyond traditional STEM fields, and which can also be used to foster computational thinking (CT) skills. Prior research has shown numerous interdisciplinary benefits related to CT, however, these influential factors have often been investigated with relatively few variables. This study investigated factors that may lead to 4th and 5th grade elementary school students’ development of computational thinking skills in collaborative robotics activities by hypothesizing a model which proposed that a problem solving inventory, intrinsic motivation, and enjoyment were the main predictors of computational thinking skills. The model was then tested by surveying students with several psychometric inventories where a revised model was then constructed. The study found significant relationships between perceived competence and enjoyment, and learning motivation, and intrinsic motivation. Another important finding was that problem solving was a significant predictor of computational thinking skills. Results were interpreted with reference to implications for possible means of improving learning outcomes when using collaborative robotics in an educational setting.

N2 - Computational modeling holds significant promise as a tool for improving how theory is developed, expressed, and used to inform empirical research and evaluation efforts. However, the knowledge and skillsets needed to build computational models are rarely developed in the training received by social and organizational scientists. The purpose of this manuscript is to provide an accessible introduction to and reference for building computational models to represent theory. We first discuss important principles and recommendations for “thinking about” theory and developing explanatory accounts in ways that facilitate translating their core assumptions, specifications, and ideas into a computational model. Next, we address some frequently asked questions related to building computational models that introduce several fundamental tasks/concepts involved in building models to represent theory and demonstrate how they can be implemented in the R programming language to produce executable model code. The accompanying supplemental materials describes additional considerations relevant to building and using computational models, provides multiple examples of complete computational model code written in R, and an interactive application offering guided practice on key model-building tasks/concepts in R.

N2 - Fostering students’ computer programming skills has become an important educational issue in the globe. However, it remains a challenge for students to understand those abstract concepts when learning computer programming, implying the need to provide instant learning diagnosis and feedback in computer programming activities. In this study, a Two-Tier Test-Based Programming Training (T3PT) approach was proposed. Accordingly, an online learning system was developed to provide students with precision feedback for guiding them to identify misconceptions of computer programming to improve their computer programming learning achievement. In order to examine the effects of the proposed approach, a learning system was developed and a quasi-experiment was conducted. Two classes of 99 eighth-grade students from Taiwan were divided into an experimental group and a control group. The students in the experimental group used the learning system based on the T3PT approach, while the control group used the conventional learning system. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach was significantly superior to the conventional programming learning approach in terms of students’ programming logic concepts, problem-solving awareness, technology acceptance, and satisfaction with the learning approach. Accordingly, discussion and suggestions are provided for future research.

N2 - Technology has become an integral part of teaching and learning, but there is still limited understanding of how it is utilized to support computing education in early childhood. To address this knowledge gap, this review investigated the current implementation of computing technologies in early childhood settings, the implementation of computing activities, the learning outcomes achieved by students, and the utilization of assessment strategies to evaluate student learning. Through a systematic review and synthesis of 31 empirical studies published between 2014 and 2020, this review identified: (1) Twenty-two computing technologies that feature three types of computing environments; (2) Eight types of learning activities to engage children in computing; (3) A variety of learning outcomes accomplished in cognitive and non-cognitive dimensions; (4) A wide range of assessment strategies to evaluate students’ outcomes in different dimensions. This review strengthened the evidence base for the benefits of teaching computing with technology to children, informed the design of age-appropriate computing technology and learning activities, and identified research gaps to inform future research. Implications were provided to inform the future design and delivery of computing instruction to early childhood learners.

N2 - Computational methods have increased the objectivity of measures of human behavior and positioned personality science to benefit from the ongoing digital revolution. In this review, we define and discuss computational personality assessment (CPA), a measurement process that uses computational technologies to obtain estimates of personality. We briefly review some of the most promising sources of data currently used for CPA: mobile sensing, digital footprints from social media, images, language, and experience sampling. We present a concise overview of key findings, discuss the promise and opportunities of CPA (e.g., moving towards objective measures of personality, obtaining new insights from big data), and highlight important limitations and challenges in the development and application of CPA (e.g., establishing reliability and validity, selecting appropriate ground truth criterion, assessing affect and cognition, implications for ethics and privacy). We conclude with our perspective on how CPA could change our understanding of individual differences.

N2 - This article presents the design, construct validation, and reliability of a self-report instrument in Spanish that aims to characterize different types of strategies that students can use to learn computer programming. We provide a comprehensive overview of the identification of learning strategies in the existing literature, the design and development of preliminary questionnaire items, the refinement of item wording, and the examination of the internal structure and reliability of the final instrument. The construction of the items was based on the educational theory of Self-Regulated Learning. The final version of the questionnaire, called the Computer Programming Learning Strategies Questionnaire (CEAPC), was administered to 647 students enrolled in computer programming courses. The data collected from the participants were used to examine the construct validity and reliability of the questionnaire. The CEAPC consists of 13 subscales, each corresponding to a different type of learning strategy, and a total of 89 items. Statistical analyses of the data indicate that the CEAPC has adequate construct validity. In addition, the results of the internal consistency analysis indicate satisfactory reliability across the different subscales of the instrument. This study contributes to the field of educational research, particularly in the area of self-regulated learning in computer programming.

N2 - In higher education, it is challenging to cultivate non-computer science majors’ programming concepts. This study used the GAME model (gamification, assessment, modeling, and enquiry) in a programming education course to enhance undergraduates’ self-efficacy and performance of basic programming concepts. There were 83 undergraduates taking part in this study, which adopted a quasi-experimental research design. Students in the experimental group (n = 43) experienced a course in which the GAME model was used to design the block-based programming course. The control group (n = 40) was given a general information education course covering similar learning concepts without the game-based learning strategy. The analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was adopted to investigate the effect of the GAME model on students’ learning outcomes for the quantitative data. In the qualitative analysis, students’ responses to the course perception questionnaire were coded and analyzed. The results showed that students in the experimental group outperformed their counterparts regarding self-efficacy and basic programming concepts. The experimental treatment resulted in a small to medium effect size difference between the two groups. The results showed that incorporating the GAME model into block-based programming teaching helped improve undergraduates’ self-efficacy and performance of basic programming concepts. In addition, these experimental group undergraduates also perceived the pedagogic GAME model positively. Several research suggestions are proposed based on the findings of the present study.

N2 - An issue arising in emergency distance education procedures, such as the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, is a lack of appropriate high-quality content and course activities for high ability students suitable for distance education. In this study, online CAD-based learning experiences structured with the Tinkercad Circuits Platform designed for gifted students were investigated based on the opinions of students regarding the distance education activity and the evaluations of the students’ scientific writing skills. This study used a single case holistic design with 10 gifted 6th-grade students at Usak Science and Art Center in Türkiye. All of the students stated that they had not previously encountered an activity such as the “smart air conditioning system”. The students also stated that although the activity was carried out in the form of distance education, it was positive and fun to be application-based, and that it was fun to research, discuss, design, and code with Tinkercad to look for a solution to the given problem. The evaluation of students’ products showed participants’ high level of proficiency in activities requiring advanced problem-solving skills, including planning the solution to the problem, creating an alternative plan for the solution, realizing, and evaluating the design.

N2 - The computational aero-acoustic study of an isolated passenger car tire is carried out to understand the effect of dimensions of longitudinal tire grooves and operational parameters (velocity and temperature) on tire noise. The computational fluid dynamics and acoustic models are used to obtain aero-acoustic tire noise at near-field and far-field receivers around the tire and artificial neural networks-based regression are used to study the highly non-linear and interactive causal relationships in the system. Unsteady Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes based realizable k-epsilon model is used to solve the flow field in the computational domain. The Ffowcs Williams and Hawkings model is used to obtain aero-acoustic tire noise at far-field positions. Spectral analysis is used to convert the output time domain to frequency domain and to obtain A-weighted sound pressure level. Artificial neural network–based response surface regression is conducted to understand casual relationships between A-weighted sound pressure level and control variables (Groove depth, Groove width, Temperature and velocity). Maximum A-weighted sound pressure level is observed in the wake region of the tire model. The interaction study indicates that ∼10% reduction in the aero-acoustic emissions is possible by selecting appropriate combinations of groove width and groove depth. The interaction of velocity with width is found to be most significant with respect to A-weighted sound pressure level at all receivers surrounding the tire. The interaction of operational parameters, that is, velocity and temperature are found to be significant with respect to A-weighted sound pressure level at wake and front receivers. Therefore, the regional speed limits and seasonal temperatures need to be considered while designing the tire to achieve minimum aero-acoustic emissions.

N2 - Uzbekistan has not adopted robotics education as the school curriculum yet. However, several robotics learning centers have introduced robotics education in an informal setting. This research paper aims to highlight the essence of robotics education in Uzbekistan investigating the perception of parents and children to their full potential and identifying impediments to the process of implementing robotics in Uzbekistan. This research study involves primary and secondary research methods. A systematic literature review was conducted to examine the reflection of robotics education among primary and secondary school children. Official statistical data was gathered to prove the scope of demographics. Primary data was collected through the survey among parents whose children attended robotics classes. Ultimately, the authors have used empirical evidence to provide recommendations and solutions on how to implement robotics education effectively in Uzbekistan. Much emphasis has not been put on robotics education in Uzbekistan, despite reforms in the field of STEM education. Moreover, the condition (including teachers, lesson materials, classrooms, computers, and robotics kits) to implement robotics classes as more developed countries are doing has not been created properly, which hampers the introduction of robotics at schools. In addition, the majority of parents are not fully aware of the authentic value of robotics education in children’s lives. Hence, Uzbek schools are lagging in the field of robotics.

N2 - The 10th annual International Conference of Students of Systematic Musicology (SysMus) took place on September 13–15, 2017, at Queen Mary University of London (UoL). The SysMus series has established itself as an international, student-run conference series aimed at introducing graduate students to networking and discussing their work in an academic conference environment. The term “Systematic Musicology,” first coined by Guido Adler (1885), nowadays covers a wide range of systematic or empirical approaches to theoretical, psychological, neuroscientific, ethnographic, and computational methodologies in music research. Presentations for SysMus17 focused on three central topics in relation to music: cognition and neuroscience, computation, and health and well-being. Each of these topics was the subject of workshops as well as keynotes by Prof. Lauren Stewart (Goldsmiths University of London and Music in the Brain Centre, Aarhus University), Prof. Elaine Chew and Dr. Marcus Pearce (both Queen Mary UoL), Dr. Daniel Müllensiefen (Goldsmiths UoL), and Prof. Aaron Williamon (Royal College of Music). Further presentations addressed issues relating to harmony and rhythm, musicians and performance, music and emotion, and sociology of music. This year’s conference brought together early-career researchers from the fields of musicology, psychology, and medicine, allowing them to socialize, share their work, and gain insight into interdisciplinary approaches to their subjects. SysMus17 was organized by students at Queen Mary’s Music Cognition Lab and was particularly marked by the series’ 10th anniversary, the live streaming of all presentations via social media, and a carbon-offsetting Green Initiative. The proceedings of SysMus17 will be available on demand from the conference website (www.sysmus17.qmul.ac.uk) and the videos will be made available for public access.

N2 - Whole number computations are a critical skill that serves as a foundation upon which higher-order concepts in mathematics are taught to children. To facilitate their instruction, educators often use multiple representations to support a child’s cognition. Representations with physical manipulatives are widely studied through a graduated instructional sequence featuring concrete, representational, and abstract stages of learning. In contrast, research on representational sequences featuring virtual manipulatives is less robust. Thus, this study evaluated an instructional strategy with virtual manipulatives, static representational drawings, and abstract algorithms to teach multiplication to three U.S. elementary students with mathematics difficulty. A functional relation was established via a single-subject multiple probe design between the treatment and students’ accuracy performance. Baseline-corrected Tau estimates confirmed a medium effect size for all three students, while student performance on measures assessing the number of errors committed and the duration of sessions also returned favorable findings.

N2 - This article sheds light on the emerging forms of cultural capital that media practitioners need to acquire to work with automated news, as in Bourdieu’s understanding of unique abilities that include, among others, journalistic expertise and technical know-how. To uncover these new skills, we carried out 30 interviews with editorial staff, executives and technologists working at 23 media organisations based in Europe, North America and Australia. We show that these new forms of cultural capital are essentially two-fold: on the one hand, they involve taking a “structured journalism” approach so as to think of what an ideal story may look like, and then by breaking it down into smaller predictable elements that can be reusable across many versions of that same story; on the other hand, they also call for knowing how to embed a media organisation’s standards and practices into code for automated news. Overall this study argues that a new type of cultural capital emerges, as it is associated with the production of automated news. We call it the distinct-abstract capital, whereby journalism is thought of both as a one-off endeavour and as a process that can be deconstructed in an abstract way close to computer programming.

N2 - Mass capture ratio of a hypersonic air intake is one of the most important performance parameters. However, no a priori estimate of its value exists for use in initial design exercise of a hypersonic vehicle. In the present work, an air intake of a non-axisymmetric scramjet engine, designed using stream thrust methodology, is studied using computational fluid dynamic techniques. A large amount of air mass flow rate is observed to spill from the sides, which is not accounted for in the initial design phase. In absence of even an approximate estimate of this spillage, computational fluid dynamic studies become the only available tool to evaluate the mass capture ratio. Simulations are also carried out with a side wall at the intake to stop spillage. Although mass capture ratio and static pressure at combustor entry improve, deterioration in other flow parameters such as static temperature, Mach number and total pressure is observed.

N2 - Scientific knowledge, ideally neutral and impartial, is inevitably shaped by geographical, economic, and cultural contexts. This research contends that overcoming the constraints of human and economic scarcity, inertia, and limited funding access demands development of collaborative research networks. To this end, four university laboratories from Brazil and Chile - UFRJ, UBB, UTFSM and UAI - have united to advance robotics applied to architecture. The methodology begins with an analysis of Industry 4.0, Fab Lab implementations, and robotics in architecture in the region. They identify key research aspects by mapping each laboratory’s activities and technologies to pinpoint expertise and potential collaborative areas. The authors propose a summary table comparing the labs and a chronological overview to track regional robotics advancement. To raise awareness among peers, the initiative involves joint actions such as courses, workshops and technical visits.1 Recognising the scarcity of robotic units and the inapplicability of procedures from wealthier contexts, the authors draw on their lab experience to propose guidelines for implementing robotics research units in academia within the region. This includes technological alternatives, installation considerations, and detailed configuration reviews. The deployment of additional robotic units is a means to foster collaboration and bolster the network. Anticipated outcomes encompass increased critical mass, collaborative research initiatives, faculty and student exchange across institutions, higher publication rates, knowledge acquisition, and improved access to global funding agencies. In summary, the Southern Creative Robotics network initiative aims to catalyse the creative integration of digital manufacturing and robotics technology within design in the Ibero-American context.

N2 - This special issue raises two thematic questions: (1) How will AI change learning in the future and what role will human beings play in the interaction with machine learning, and (2), What can we learn from the articles in this special issue for future research? These questions are reflected in the frame of the recent discussion of human and machine learning. AI for learning provides many applications and multimodal channels for supporting people in cognitive and non-cognitive task domains. The articles in this special issue evidence that agency, engagement, self-efficacy, and collaboration are needed in learning and working with intelligent tools and environments. The importance of social elements is also clear in the articles. The articles also point out that the teacher’s role in digital pedagogy primarily involves facilitating and coaching. AI in learning has a high potential, but it also has many limitations. Many worries are linked with ethical issues, such as biases in algorithms, privacy, transparency, and data ownership. This special issue also highlights the concepts of explainability and explicability in the context of human learning. We need much more research and research-based discussion for making AI more trustworthy for users in learning environments and to prevent misconceptions.

N2 - Whole number computations are a critical skill that serves as a foundation upon which higher-order concepts in mathematics are taught to children. To facilitate their instruction, educators often use multiple representations to support a child’s cognition. Representations with physical manipulatives are widely studied through a graduated instructional sequence featuring concrete, representational, and abstract stages of learning. In contrast, research on representational sequences featuring virtual manipulatives is less robust. Thus, this study evaluated an instructional strategy with virtual manipulatives, static representational drawings, and abstract algorithms to teach multiplication to three U.S. elementary students with mathematics difficulty. A functional relation was established via a single-subject multiple probe design between the treatment and students’ accuracy performance. Baseline-corrected Tau estimates confirmed a medium effect size for all three students, while student performance on measures assessing the number of errors committed and the duration of sessions also returned favorable findings.

N2 - The capability for solving compressible fluid flows in the rotating frame of reference is added to an existed open-source CFD solver, namely, HiSA solver. The new implementation is explained and validated using the experimental data of the Sikorsky S-76 rotor. A comparison is presented between the moving mesh results obtained from the original HiSA code and the single rotating frame results achieved through the new implementation. The comparison includes an analysis of torque and thrust values, as well as computational costs. The results imply that, for evaluating the performance of an isolated rotor or for shape optimization purposes at the transonic regime, the single rotating frame method, like the one introduced in the current work, can provide accurate results within an acceptable computational budget. Furthermore, the results show that, at least 25 revolutions are required for the transient analysis to reach an acceptable steady-state converged solution like the one obtained by the single rotating frame method.

N2 - A significant fraction of computational software for scientific research grows through accretion. In a common scenario, a small group develops a code for a specific purpose. Others find the software useful, so they add to it for their own use. The software grows to the point where its management becomes intractable and scientific results obtained from it become unreliable. This is in stark contrast with a small number of scientific codes that have undergone a design process, be it due to an upfront investment, or when haphazardly grown codes have reset and started again. At a minimum, these codes reduce the time to obtain research results for the communities they serve because individual researchers do not have to develop their own codes. They provide further benefits; the results they produce are more reproducible due to greater scrutiny, leading to better science. One of the more overlooked benefits, which is perhaps of greater significance, is that a well-designed code can expand to serve communities beyond the ones it was designed for. Thus, research communities with similar computational requirements can symbiotically improve computation-based research for each other. In this article, we present a case study of FLASH, a code that was designed and developed for simulating thermonuclear runaways such as novae and type Ia supernovae in astrophysics. Designed to be modular and extensible, users from several diverse research areas have added capabilities to it and adapted it for their own communities. Examples include cosmology, high-energy density physics, core-collapse supernovae, star formation, fluid–structure interactions, and chemical combustion. We give a summary of design features that facilitated the expansion and quantify the effort needed to expand into some of the above-mentioned fields. We also quantify the impact on different communities by mining the database of publications using FLASH, collected by its developers.

N2 - In this dialogue, Phillip Howard introduces “computational propaganda” as an emerging communication tool in political communication and a perspective for investigating misinformation and disinformation. By articulating the concepts, patterns, and mechanisms of computational propaganda, Howard proposes a socio-technical framework for studying computational propaganda. He calls for mixed methods to undertake computational research alongside qualitative investigation, thus addressing the computational as well as the political. Howard emphasizes the battle against algorithm bias, manipulation, and misinformation, and he advocates building an International Panel on the Information Environment (IPIE), an international scientific collaboration, to respond to the challenges. In addition, Howard offers advice on further research in computational propaganda.

N2 - This intervention advances glitches as epistemological vectors for apprehending and engaging the significance of digitally-mediated spatialities that appear nonperformative against normative scripts of urban computational paradigms. Drawing on two strands of contemporary thinking about glitches as systemic design features of digital systems and as generative fissures within them, we mobilize a queer orientation that stays with the generative tensions of urban spatialities that present as idiosyncratic and as interrupting. We mobilize this epistemological approach through illustrative U.S. based examples of seemingly abandoned shared e-bikes, performatively ‘ugly’ homes, and wilful property dilapidation wrought through the registers of desire and aesthetics. In so doing, we show how glitch empistemologies render visible how the technocapitalist manufacturing of normative spatial desires for particular kinds of urban sociospatialities and aesthetic visual signatures are both secured and interrupted on digitally-mediated and -mediatized terrains. Glitch epistemologies establish the significance of small-scale disorientations in digital urban mediations, engaging these nonperformativities and non-computes as unexceptional openings onto everyday possibilities for politics in computational cities.

N2 - Pair Programming is considered an effective approach to programming education, but the synchronous collaboration of two programmers involves complex coordination, making this method difficult to be widely adopted in educational settings. Artificial Intelligence (AI) code-generation tools have outstanding capabilities in program generation and natural language understanding, creating conducive conditions for pairing with humans in programming. Now some more mature tools are gradually being implemented. This review summarizes the current status of educational applications and research on AI-assisted programming technology. Through thematic coding of literature, existing research focuses on five aspects: underlying technology and tool introduction, performance evaluation, the potential impacts and coping strategies, exploration of behavioral patterns in technological application, and ethical and safety issues. A systematic analysis of current literature provides the following insights for future academic research related to the practice of “human-machine pairing” in programming: (1) Affirming the value of AI code-generation tools while also clearly defining their technical limitations and ethical risks; (2) Developing adaptive teaching ecosystems and educational models, conducting comprehensive empirical research to explore the efficiency mechanisms of AI-human paired programming; (3) Further enriching the application of research methods by integrating speculative research with empirical research, combining traditional methods with emerging technologies.

N2 - In order to eliminate the shortcomings of traditional classroom teaching, such as neglecting student-centeredness, lack of teaching resources, and outdated teaching evaluation methods, and to comprehensively improve the quality of classroom teaching, taking the computer application foundation course as an example, this paper takes enterprise-level office demands as the entry point, combines enterprise office cases with teaching, integrates ideological and political materials to reconstruct teaching content, and incorporates the characteristics of the Chaoxing Learning Platform. Based on the premise of front-end analysis, this paper carries out teaching design from the three aspects of pre-class, in-class, and after-class, and implements a blended teaching practice based on Chaoxing. The results show that after adopting this teaching method, students’ overall course grades have increased significantly from 77.79 to 84.99, and the classroom teaching effect has also been enhanced. The reform of this course has been highly recognized by students, promoting the cultivation of undergraduate students’ innovative abilities while also comprehensively enhancing their proactivity and scientific literacy.

We show that CI methods can generate very high quality solutions, providing a sound methodology to solve complex optimization problems in life sciences.

N2 - Reproducibility is fundamental to science, and an important component of reproducibility is computational reproducibility: the ability of a researcher to recreate the results of a published study using the original author’s raw data and code. Although most people agree that computational reproducibility is important, it is still difficult to achieve in practice. In this article, the authors describe their approach to enabling computational reproducibility for the 12 articles in this special issue of Socius about the Fragile Families Challenge. The approach draws on two tools commonly used by professional software engineers but not widely used by academic researchers: software containers (e.g., Docker) and cloud computing (e.g., Amazon Web Services). These tools made it possible to standardize the computing environment around each submission, which will ease computational reproducibility both today and in the future. Drawing on their successes and struggles, the authors conclude with recommendations to researchers and journals.

N2 - A fluid–structure interaction numerical simulation was performed to investigate the flow field around a flexible flapping wing using an in-house developed computational fluid dynamics/computational structural dynamics solver. The three-dimensional (3D) fluid–structure interaction of the flapping locomotion was predicted by loosely coupling preconditioned Navier–Stokes solutions and non-linear co-rotational structural solutions. The computational structural dynamic solver was specifically developed for highly flexible flapping wings by considering large geometric non-linear characteristics. The high fidelity of the developed methodology was validated by benchmark tests. Then, an analysis of flexible flapping wings was carried out with a specific focus on the unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms and effects of flexion on flexible flapping wings. Results demonstrate that the flexion will introduce different flow fields, and thus vary thrust generation and pressure distribution significantly. In the meanwhile, relationship between flapping frequency and flexion plays an important role on efficiency. Therefore, appropriate combination of frequency and flexion of flexible flapping wings provides higher efficiency. This study may give instruction for further design of flexible flapping wings.

N2 - Methods for analyzing neural and computational social science data are usually used by different types of scientists and generally seen as distinct, but they strongly complement one another. Computational social science methodologies can strengthen and contextualize individual-level analysis, specifically our understanding of the brain. Neuroscience can help to unpack the mechanisms that lead from micro- through meso- to macro-level observations. Integrating levels of analysis is essential to unified progress in social research. We present two example areas that illustrate this integration. First, combining egocentric social network data with neural variables from the “egos” provides insight about why and for whom certain types of antismoking messages may be more or less effective. Second, combining tools from natural language processing with neuroimaging reveals mechanisms involved in successful message propagation, and suggests links from microscopic to macroscopic scales.

N2 - This study focused on the digital design practices of Raul, a 15-year-old participant at a summer video game design camp for adolescents. As Raul developed his original game, You Will Perish, I wondered what his design process might reveal about (a) the practice of affectively and procedurally literate video game design and (b) the literacy pedagogies that can support such design. Guided by the concept of serendipity, I describe Raul’s design practice as an open process characterized by bouts of failure, chance, and discovery, and I examine how such forces shaped the emergence of his game. Using transversal analysis, I trace Raul’s design through an account of frustration and failure, perseverance and pride, showing how the challenges of the game’s creator become those of the game’s players. The study highlights the generative potential of serendipitous literacies wherever and whenever literacy happens.

N2 - In this study I examine the use of visualization within everyday research practices in computational physics. In doing so, I attempt to move from the well documented representational issues elicited by the concept of the image, to more microscale issues of the habitual structuring of the everyday that emerge when a specific example of science in the making is analysed. To this end, I focus on one specific example, of tracing a computational error through a fluid dynamics simulation of the ‘lock exchange’ experiment. This simulation is one small part of the research that goes on within one of Europe’s largest computational physics research groups, the Applied Modelling and Computation Group at Imperial College in London, where I am involved in ongoing ethnographic fieldwork research. Visualization is shown to play a central role, not just in daily routines of investigation and problem solving, but in the process of habituation through which scientists cultivate the dispositions through which everyday life gains its texture and form. Far from being a detachable representation of a part of a world, simulation is shown to come into being as a process within a world structured by the repetitions and improvizations that characterize research practice.

N2 - Psychiatric research is in crisis. We highlight efforts to overcome current challenges by focusing on the emerging field of computational psychiatry, which might enable the field to move from a symptom-based description of mental illness to descriptors based on objective computational multidimensional functional variables. We survey recent efforts toward this goal and describe a set of methods that together form a toolbox to aid this research program. We identify four levels in computational psychiatry: (a) behavioral tasks that index various psychological processes, (b) computational models that identify the generative psychological processes, (c) parameter-estimation methods concerned with quantitatively fitting these models to subject behavior by focusing on hierarchical Bayesian estimation as a rich framework with many desirable properties, and (d) machine-learning clustering methods that identify clinically significant conditions and subgroups of individuals. As a proof of principle, we apply these methods to two different data sets. Finally, we highlight challenges for future research.

N2 - Insurgency conflicts pose significant challenges to societies globally. The increase of insurgency conflicts creates a need to understand how insurgencies arise, and to identify societal drivers of insurgencies or effective strategies to counter them. In this paper, we analyze the contributions of computational modeling methods for the analysis of insurgent conflicts. We formalize a specific literature-based analysis framework using the identified key factors and drivers, which enables the evaluation of specific models in this domain. Through a systematic literature search, we identify 64 computational models to apply our framework. We highlight the development and contributions of various methodologies through an in-depth analysis of 13 high-quality models. The evaluation of these computational models revealed promising directions and future topics to design specific simulation models for all identified factors. In addition, our analysis revealed specific pitfalls concerning validity issues for each of the modeling methods.

In this article, we review a selection of published research regarding computational methods, primarily from systems biology, which support translational research from the molecular level to the bedside, with a focus on applications in trauma and critical care. Trauma is the leading cause of mortality in Americans younger than 45 years, and its rapid progression offers both opportunities and challenges for computational analysis of trends in molecular patterns associated with outcomes and therapeutic interventions. This review presents methods and domain-specific examples that may inspire the development of new algorithms and computational methods that use both molecular and clinical data for diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy in disease progression.

N2 - Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a prominent topic in K-12 education recently. However, pedagogical design has remained a major challenge, especially among young learners. Guided by the Zone of Proximal Development theory and AI education research literature, this design-based study proposes an analogy-based pedagogical approach to support AI teaching and learning in upper primary education. This pedagogical approach is centered on human–AI comparison, where humans are gradually shifted from an analogue to a contrast to make visible the attributes, mechanisms, and processes of AI. To evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experimental study with mixed methods was conducted. The quantitative comparison shows that the participants in the experimental group learning with the analogy-based pedagogical approach significantly outperformed their peers with the conventional direct instructional approach in all three dimensions of AI knowledge, skills, and ethical awareness. Qualitative analyses further reveal its pedagogical benefits, including demystifying AI through relatable and engaging learning, supporting student comprehension and skill mastery, and nurturing critical thinking and attitudes. The analogy-based approach contributes to the field of K-12 AI education with an age-appropriate, child-friendly pedagogical approach. Notably, AI education should prioritize teaching for student understanding, and AI should be recognized as an independent subject with interdisciplinary applications.

N2 - The aim of this study was to investigate the correlational and causal relationship between middle school students’ entrepreneurial competencies and science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) attitudes. A total of 648 middle school students (seventh and eighth grade) participated in this study. STEM attitude scale and two entrepreneurial competency scales that were developed in different studies in the literature were used as data collection tools. In addition, a simple regression, a multiple regression and a stepwise multiple regression analysis were executed to analyse the data. The correlational analysis showed that there was a moderate level, positive correlation between the STEM attitudes of students and their overall entrepreneurial competencies. Also, the multiple regression analysis showed that entrepreneurial competencies consisting of professionalism, risk-taking, creativity and tenacity explained 41% of the change in STEM attitude. The stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that professionalism predicted the most the STEM attitude statistically more.

How may we celebrate local tectonic languages while also revisiting them through computer-based systems in architecture? The project examined here highlights novel possibilities for cultural expression and craftsmanship through computational design methods, retaining the expressive potential of a local craft while de-familiarizing its cultural context.

I adopt Tabbarah’s term “computational regionalism” to describe this process and elaborate it as a five-step sequence. Computational regionalism employs computational methods to translate local craft knowledge and tectonic languages into new interpretations and poetics of construction. Its process of creative de-familiarization raises critical questions about the local and the universal.

N2 - We propose a new performance metric based on computational action. We examine work as it evolves in time and compute computational action as the integral of the work function over time. We compare the action generated at less than full power with the action that could have been generated at full power. We claim that the goal of performance optimization is to minimize lost, or wasted, action. We calculate our metric for some computers in the Top500 list (http://www.top500.org) and propose a new ranking based on least action wasted. When work is a function of the resources applied, we use the classical techniques of the calculus of variations to minimize wasted action. From the result of this exercise, we calculate productivity as the ratio of work produced to resources used.

N2 - To deal with ever-larger datasets, media scholars are increasingly using computational analytic methods. This article focuses on how the traditional (manual) approach to conducting a content analysis—a primary method in the study of media messages—is being reconfigured, assesses what is gained and lost in turning to computational solutions, and builds on a “hybrid” approach to content analysis. We argue that computational methods are most fruitful when variables are readily identifiable in texts and when source material is easily parsed. Manual methods, though, are most appropriate for complex variables and when source material is not well digitized. These modes can be effectively combined throughout the process of content analysis to facilitate expansive and powerful analyses that are reliable and meaningful.

N2 - The substantial volume, continued growth, and resulting complexity of the scientific literature not only increases the need for systematic, replicable, and rigorous literature reviews, but also highlights the natural limits of human researchers’ information processing capabilities. In search of a solution to this dilemma, computational techniques are beginning to support human researchers in synthesizing large bodies of literature. However, actionable methodological guidance on how to design, conduct, and document such computationally augmented literature reviews is lacking to date. We respond by introducing and defining computational literature reviews (CLRs) as a new review method and put forward a six-step roadmap, covering the CLR process from identifying the review objectives to selecting algorithms and reporting findings. We make the CLR method accessible to novice and expert users alike by identifying critical design decisions and typical challenges for each step and provide practical guidelines for tailoring the CLR method to four conceptual review goals. As such, we present CLRs as a literature review method where the choice, design, and implementation of a CLR are guided by specific review objectives, methodological capabilities, and resource constraints of the human researcher.

N2 - Computational thinking (CT) uses concepts that are essential to computing and information science to solve problems, design and evaluate complex systems, and understand human reasoning and behavior. This way of thinking has important implications in computer sciences as well as in almost every other field. Therefore, we contend that CT should be taught in elementary schools and included in every university’s educational curriculum. Several studies that measure the impact of teaching programming, analytical thinking, and CT have been conducted. In this review, we analyze and discuss findings from these studies and highlight the importance of learning programming with a focus on the development of CT skills at a young age. We also describe the tools that are available to improve the teaching of CT and provide a state-of-the-art overview of how programming is being taught at schools and universities in Colombia and around the world.

N2 - Computational Thinking (CT) and creativity are considered two vital skills for the 21st century that should be incorporated into future curricula around the world. We studied the relationship between these two constructs while focusing on learners’ personal characteristics. Two types of creativity were examined: creative thinking and computational creativity. The research was conducted among 174 middle school students from Spain. Data collected using a standardized creativity test (Torrance’s TTCT) were triangulated with data drawn from students’ log files that documented their activity in a game-based learning environment for CT (Kodetu). We found some interesting associations between CT and the two constructs of creativity. These associations shed light on positive associations between each of the two creativity constructs and CT acquisition, as well as between the two creativity constructs themselves. Additionally, we highlight differences between boys and girls, as girls were found to be more creative on both creativity measures. Other differences associated with school affiliation, prior coding knowledge, and technology affinity are also discussed.

N2 - Over the past decade, initiatives around the world have introduced computing into K–12 education under the umbrella of computational thinking. While initial implementations focused on skills and knowledge for college and career readiness, more recent framings include situated computational thinking (identity, participation, creative expression) and critical computational thinking (political and ethical impacts of computing, justice). This expansion reflects a revaluation of what it means for learners to be computationally-literate in the 21st century. We review the current landscape of K–12 computing education, discuss interactions between different framings of computational thinking, and consider how an encompassing framework of computational literacies clarifies the importance of computing for broader K–12 educational priorities as well as key unresolved issues.

N2 - This multiple case study aimed to investigate ESL teachers’ practices when they learn and design their ESL lesson activities, with a particular emphasis on the integration of computational thinking through Scratch. Scratch was considered as the computational thinking platform, and teachers were designers of language instruction with/for computational thinking. We aimed to explore ESL teachers’ lesson designs incorporating computational tools. We collected audio and video recordings from individual workshops and semi-structured interviews and then conducted a thematic analysis. Five themes emerged: (a) learning experiences shaped project designs, (b) teachers’ understanding of student’s interests and age appropriateness shaped Scratch projects and pedagogical choices, (c) integrating computational thinking with ESL instruction was challenging, (d) efforts were made to reduce technical and content challenges, and (e) teachers considered and used Scratch as an ESL tool. Our findings underscored teacher agency in how teachers adapted their instruction based on perceived student needs and capabilities.

N2 - Recent advances in artificial intelligence have brought attention to computational thinking (CT) in school education worldwide. However, little is known about the development of the literacy of CT in children, mainly because of the lack of proper psychometric assessments. We developed the first psychometrically validated assessment on the literacy of CT of children in Chinese elementary schools, coined as the Computational Thinking Assessment for Chinese Elementary Students (CTA-CES). Items were constructed to reflect key aspects of CT such as abstraction, algorithm thinking, decomposition, evaluation, and pattern recognition. To examine the test reliability and validity, we recruited two samples of 280 third- to sixth-grade students in total. Cronbach’s alpha provided evidence for the reliability of the test scores, item response theory analyses demonstrated psychometric appropriateness, whereas construct validity was verified by convergent validity, and criterion-related validity was confirmed by correlations between the CTA-CES and measures related to CT, namely reasoning, spatial ability, and verbal ability. In addition, an fMRI study further demonstrated similar neural activation patterns when students conducted the CTA-CES and programming tasks. Taken together, the CTA-CES is the first reliable and valid instrument for measuring the literacy of CT for Chinese children, and may be applicable to children worldwide.

N2 - This meta-analysis determined game-based learning’s (GBL) overall effect on students’ computational thinking (CT) and tested for moderators, using 28 effect sizes from 24 studies of 2,134 participants. The random effects model results showed that GBL had a significant positive overall effect on students’ CT (g = 0.677, 95% confidence interval 0.532–0.821) with significant heterogeneity among effect sizes. Among game types, role-playing yielded the largest GBL effect size, followed by action, puzzles, and adventures. Moreover, the effect of GBL on CT was weaker among students in countries that were more individualistic than others. Lastly, interventions between four hours and one week showed the largest GBL effect size, followed by those over four weeks, up to four hours, and between one week and four weeks.

N2 - This paper examines a method which can be used by instructors pursuing innovative methods for language teaching, which expands learners’ motivation in second language learning. Computational thinking (CT) is a problem-solving skill which can motivate students’ English language learning. Designing a learning activity which integrates CT into English language learning has been considered in only a few academic studies. This study aimed to explore whether integrating CT into English language learning can be useful for improving learners’ motivation and performance. The method of “present, practice, and produce” was applied as a method of presenting computational thinking in the English language learning classroom. Fifty-two elementary school students (52) participated in the experimental study. Following an experimental design, data were collected and analyzed from a combination of knowledge test scores, storytelling, motivation, and anxiety surveys. The experimental results indicate that the CT strategy improves students’ language learning and raises their motivation in the two dimensions of extrinsic and intrinsic goal orientation. These results imply the positive effect of CT strategy on strengthening problem-solving skills of students participating in digital storytelling and increases their motivation and performance in English language learning.

N2 - The Computer Science Teachers Association has asserted that computational thinking equips students with essential critical thinking which allows them to conceptualize, analyze, and solve more complex problems. These skills are applicable to all content area as students learn to use strategies, ideas, and technological practices more effectively as digital natives. This research examined over 200 elementary students’ pre- and posttest changes in computational thinking from a 10-week coding program using adapted lessons from code.org’s Blockly programming language and CSUnplugged that were delivered as part of the regular school day. Participants benefited from early access to computer science (CS) lessons with increases in computational thinking and applying coding concepts to the real world. Interviews from participants included examples of CS connections to everyday life and interdisciplinary studies at school. Thus, the study highlights the importance of leveraging CS access in diverse elementary classrooms to promote young students’ computational thinking; motivation in CS topics; and the learning of essential soft-skills such as collaboration, persistence, abstraction, and creativity to succeed in today’s digital world.

N2 - Computational thinking (CT) is a fundamental skill for students, and assessment is a critical factor in education. However, there is a lack of effective approaches to CT assessment. Therefore, we designed the Three-Dimensional Integrated Assessment (TDIA) framework in this article. The TDIA has two aims: one was to integrate three dimensions (directionality, openness, and process) into the design of effective assessment tasks; and the other was to assess comprehensively the three dimensions of CT including computational concepts, practices, and perspectives. Guided by the TDIA framework, we designed three pairs of tasks: closed forward tasks and closed reverse tasks, semiopen forward tasks and semiopen reverse tasks, and open tasks with a creative design report and open tasks without a creative design report. To further confirm each task’s applicability and its advantages and disadvantages, we conducted a test experiment at the end of the autumn semester in 2014 in a primary school for 3 weeks. The results indicated that (a) the reverse tasks were not more superior than the forward tasks; (b) the semiopen tasks and the open tasks were more effective than the closed tasks, and the semiopen tasks had higher difficulty and discrimination than the others; (c) the self-reports provided a helpful function for learning diagnosis and guidance; (d) the scores had no significant difference between the schoolboys and the schoolgirls in all six tasks; and (e) the six tasks’ difficulty and discrimination were all acceptable, and the semiopen tasks had higher difficulty and discrimination than the others. To effectively apply them, the following suggestions for teachers to design computational tasks are proposed: motivating students’ interest and enthusiasm, incorporating semifinished artifacts, involving learning diagnosis and guidance, and including multiple types of tasks in an assessment.

N2 - Computational design affords agency: the ability to orchestrate the material, spatial, and technical architectural system. In this specific case, it occurs through enhanced, authored means to facilitate making and performance—typically driven by concerns of structural optimization, material use, and responsivity to environmental factors—of an atmospheric rather than social nature. At issue is the positioning of this particular manner of agency solely with the architect auteur. This abruptly halts—at the moment in which fabrication commences—the ability to amend, redefine, or newly introduce fundamentally transformational constituents and their interrelationships and, most importantly, to explore the possibility for extraordinary outcomes. When the architecture becomes a functional, social, and cultural entity, in the hands of the idealized abled-bodied user, agency—especially for one of an otherly body or mind—is long gone. Even an empathetic auteur may not be able to access the motivations of the differently-abled body and neuro-divergent mind, effectively locking the constraints of the design process, which creates an exclusionary system to those beyond the purview of said auteur. It can therefore be deduced that the mechanisms or authors of a conventional computational design process cannot eradicate the exclusionary reality of an architectural system. Agency is critical, yet a more expansive terminology for agent and agency is needed. The burden to conceive of capacities that will always be highly temporal, social, unpredictable, and purposefully unknown must be shifted far from the scope of the traditional directors of the architectural system. Agency, and who it is conferred upon, must function in a manner that dissolves the distinctions between the design, the action of designing, the author of design, and those subjected to it.

N2 - CFD (Computational fluid dynamics) is a tool, through which, the entire combustion process for pulverized coal combustion (PCC) can be predicted. The solid fuel combustion modeling is not as simple as gaseous or liquid fuel combustion modeling. In the solid fuel combustion process, various physical transformations and chemical reactions occur simultaneously. Therefore in the computational modeling approach for PCC, basic physical and chemical processes such as; turbulence, radiation, devolatilization, gas-phase combustion, char reaction and soot formation/reduction are integrated to obtain the desired results. However, in order to reach the desired accuracy, different computational models should be chosen carefully. In this review, various common models that are widely used in PCC simulation are discussed scientifically along with their modeling aspects. The basic advantages and disadvantages of these models are also discussed in this study. Moreover, different models preferred by various authors for pulverized coal combustion simulation process are also summarized. From the review, it has been observed that the eddy viscosity based two-equation turbulent models and Eulerian-Lagrangian multiphase approach are mostly preferred due to better computational economy. Two competing rate devolatilization model from various finite rate models and FG-DVC devolatilization model from various phenomenological models are mostly used for PCC. Diffusion kinetic control and Intrinsic char combustion models are mostly chosen to predict the char reaction. Finite reaction rate models are preferred when the computational economy is a concern, whereas phenomenological models provide results with better accuracy because in phenomenological models realistic inputs are given as input for simulation whereas, in finite rate models, finite rate constants are mostly empirical. Most of the gas phase models are given almost equal importance. Discrete ordinate (DO) is mostly used for PCC due to its ability of volumetric radiation calculation and the ability to evaluate radiation effect on the particle phase.

N2 - Advanced non-linear dynamics, finite element computational methods and tools are utilized in order to assess the blast wave mitigation potential of the fluid–structure interaction phenomena involving rigid and deformable structures. The employed computational methods and tools are verified and validated by first demonstrating that they can quite accurately reproduce analytical solutions for a couple of well-defined blast wave propagation and interaction problems. Then the methods/tools are used to investigate the fluid–structure interaction phenomena involving deformable structures while accounting for both the interaction of the incident blast wave with the structure and for the structure-motion induced blast wave (at the back-face of the structure). To assess the role of the structure deformability, i.e. the role of the shock waves generated within the structure, the results obtained are compared with their rigid structure counterparts. This comparison established that no additional structure-deformability-related blast-mitigation effects are observed in the case of fully supported blast wave loading while, under exponentially decaying blast wave loading, such effects are observed but only under conditions when the shock wave propagation time within the structure is comparable with the incident wave decay time.

N2 - Objectives: Competent velopharyngeal (VP) function is the basis for normal speech. Understanding how VP structure influences the airflow during speech details is essential to the surgical improvement of pharyngoplasty. In this study, we aimed to illuminate the airflow features corresponding to various VP closure states using computed dynamic simulations. Methods: Three-dimensional models of the upper airways were established based on computed tomography of 8 volunteers. The velopharyngeal port was simulated by a cylinder. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were applied to illustrate the correlation between the VP port size and the airflow parameters, including the flow velocity, pressure in the velopharyngeal port, as well as the pressure in oral and nasal cavity. Results: The airflow dynamics at the velopharynx were maintained in the same velopharyngeal pattern as the area of the velopharyngeal port increased from 0 to 25 mm2. A total of 5 airflow patterns with distinct features were captured, corresponding to adequate closure, adequate/borderline closure (Class I and II), borderline/inadequate closure, and inadequate closure. The maximal orifice area that could be tolerated for adequate VP closure was determined to be 2.01 mm2. Conclusion: Different VP functions are of characteristic airflow dynamic features. Computational fluid dynamic simulation is of application potential in individualized VP surgery planning.

N2 - Several studies based on in vivo or in vitro models have found promising results for the noble gas argon in neuroprotection against ischaemic pathologies. The development of argon as a medicinal product includes the requirement for toxicity testing through non-clinical studies. The long exposure period of animals (rats) during several days results in technical and logistic challenges related to the gas administration. In particular, a minimum of 10 air changes per hour (ACH) to maintain animal welfare results in extremely large volumes of experimental gas required if the gas is not recirculated. The difficulty with handling the many cylinders prompted the development of such a recirculation-based design. To distribute the recirculating gas to individually ventilated cages and monitor them properly was deemed more difficult than constructing a single large enclosure that will hold several open cages. To address these concerns, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the preliminary design was performed. A purpose-made exposure chamber was designed based on the CFD simulations. Comparisons of the simulation results to measurements of gas concentration at two cage positions while filling show that the CFD results compare well to these limited experiments. Thus, we believe that the CFD results are representative of the gas distribution throughout the enclosure. The CFD shows that the design provides better gas distribution (i.e. a higher effective air change rate) than predicted by 10 ACH.

N2 - This article illustrates design-oriented human–computer interaction (HCI) research for creating do-it-yourself (DIY) experiences for emerging technologies. It contemplates the design objectives for the DIY construction processes through the lens of Ecological Approach to Smart Environments (EASE) and by exemplifying three case studies. The first case study introduces the design of the Home Control System of a nursing ecology for the aged. The second case study presents the Music Creation Tool research in music therapy ecology for those with disabilities, and the third study, Life Story Creation, presents a memory-sharing application for elderly amateur writers. The article carefully considers the role of users in HCI research, who in the DIY context are expected to be active and motivated crafters and builders of their personal environments. The focus of research, the user experience studies, aims at supporting creating, configuring and sharing experiences within the constructed prototypes, and at determining the new experiences that emerge from the research. The concluding objective for the article is presenting of a design framework for involving the initiative domain owners to the DIY research.

N2 - Background The creation and management of an autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as vascular access (VA) for hemodialysis patients is still a critical procedure. The placement of a functional and long-lasting VA derives from adequate planning of the surgical procedure based on physical examination, vascular mapping and selection of the best modality for arteriovenous anastomosis. The risk of AVF non-maturation and early failure is high, even when all precautions are taken to minimize these events. In addition, AVF surgery may develop very high blood flow exposing the patient to the risk of heart failure or hand ischemia. Methods The choices of the surgeons on the modalities to perform a surgical intervention for AVF should take into consideration several factors including patient clinical condition, arterial and venous vessel sizes and elasticity. However, these evaluations cannot give direct indication on VA outcome in terms of blood flow after AVF maturation. We then took advantage of theoretical models of vascular network hemodynamics and of computational fluid dynamics to develop a numerical tool for the prediction of potential blood flow of a planned VA surgery on the basis of preoperative ultrasound evaluation of arterial and venous sizes and blood flow. Results Here we present the numerical model, previously developed and tested, and we describe the web-based application that has been developed to help during surgical planning. Conclusions The use of this tool in the clinical setting should allow to reduce the incidence of AVF non-maturation as well as incidence of VA complications.

N2 - In informal argument, an essential step is to ask what will “resonate” with a particular audience and hence persuade. Marketers, for example, may recommend a certain colour for a new soda can because it “pops” on Instagram; politicians may “fine-tune” diction for different social demographics. This paper engages the need to strategise for such resonance by offering a method for automating opposition analysis (OA), a technique from semiotics used in marketing and literary analysis to plot objects of interest on oppositional axes. Central to our computational approach is a reframing of texts as proxies for thought and opposition as the product of oscillation in thought in response to those proxies, a model to which the contextual similarity information contained in word embeddings is relevant. We illustrate our approach with an analysis of texts on gun control from ProCon.org, implementing a three-step method to: 1) identify relatively prominent signifiers; 2) rank possible opposition pairs on prominence and contextual similarity scores; and 3) derive plot values for proxies on opposition pair axes. The results are discussed in terms of strategies for informal argument that might be derived by those on each side of gun control.

N2 - The space layout problem encompasses challenges that rely on a diverse range of contexts regarding urban planning and architectural design, during the traditional design phases which require immense effort and time for the evaluation of the spatial elements’ characteristic needs. In order to eliminate the burden of considering all multidimensional design aspects at the same time, this research presents a three-bodied computational method for locating the spaces of the given architectural design program in a project site, according to the defined list of design objectives and criteria. Besides the determination of the layout according to the requirements of the spatial elements, this research proposes an integration of the space syntax theory’s analytical compounds in terms of Justified Graph Analysis and Integration Values as the fitness criteria for the multi-objective evolutionary optimization in the computational model. To satisfy the integrity levels of each various characterized element within site organization, that are implied inherently by the architectural design program and generate a sustainable space network layout for the project site.

N2 - Abstract Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) probably plays a greater part in the aerodynamic design of turbomachinery than it does in any other engineering application. For many years the design of a modern turbine or compressor has been unthinkable without the help of CFD and this dependence has increased as more of the flow becomes amenable to numerical prediction. The benefits of CFD range from shorter design cycles to better performance and reduced costs and weight. This paper presents a review of the main CFD methods in use, discusses their advantages and limitations and points out where further developments are required. The paper is concerned with the application of CFD and does not describe the numerical methods or turbulence modelling in any detail.

N2 - The need to partition or discretize numeric value ranges arises in machine learning and data mining algorithms. This subtask is a potential time-consumption bottleneck, since the number of candidate partitions is exponential in the number of possible cut points in the range. Thus, many heuristic algorithms have been proposed for this task. Recently, the efficiency of optimal multisplitting has improved dramatically, due to the introduction of linear-time algorithms for training error minimization and quadratic-time generic algorithms. Whether these efficient algorithms are the best obtainable, is not yet known. In this paper, we probe the inherent complexity of the multisplitting problem. We reflect results obtained for similar problems in computational geometry and string matching to the multisplitting task. Subquadratic optimization algorithms in computational geometry rely on the monotonicity of the optimized function. We show by counterexamples that the widely used evaluation functions Training Set Error and Average Class Entropy do not satisfy the kind of monotonicity that facilitates subquadratic-time optimization. However, we also show that the Training Set Error function can be decomposed into monotonic subproblems, one per class, which explains its linear time optimization. Finally, we review recently developed techniques for speeding up optimal multisplitting.

Nowhere are these advances more evident than within the emerging field of computational social science. Using Adamic and Glance’s image of the political blogosphere as an example and social representations theory as a guiding framework, we explore how computational social science visualizations may aid and complicate public understanding of this new science. We conclude with a discussion of best practices for the production and reuse of computational social science images for public consumption.

N2 - Objective: We developed a computational model of the effects of sleep deprivation on the vigilance decrement by employing the methods of system dynamics modeling. Background: Situations that require sustained attention for a prolonged duration can cause a decline in cognitive performance, the so-called vigilance decrement. One factor that should influence the vigilance decrement is fatigue in the form of sleep deprivation. Method: We employed the methods of system dynamics modeling (numerical-integration techniques for modeling complex feedback systems) to create a computational model of the vigilance decrement. We then simulated the computational effects of sleep deprivation on the behavior of that model, using empirical data obtained from the literature for calibrating such effects. Results: Sleep deprivation of 2 hr over a 14-day period should produce an additional decline of 9% in detection performance over that found with the typical vigilance decrement, whereas 4 hr of sleep deprivation over 14 days should produce an additional decline of 14% in detection performance. Conclusion: With respect to dual-process theory, it is through its deleterious effects on analytical cognition that sleep deprivation should impact the vigilance decrement. Application: Such computational modeling may be advantageous for human-machine teaming by theoretically allowing a future autonomous software agent to anticipate the decline of human performance and compensate accordingly.

N2 - Digital trace data and computational methods are increasingly being used by researchers to study mental health phenomena (i.e. psychopathology and well-being) in social media. Computer-assisted mental health research is not simply a continuation of previous studies, but rather raises ethical, conceptual and methodological issues that are critical to behavioural science but have not yet been systematically explored. Based on a systematic review of n = 147 studies, we reveal a multidisciplinary field of research that has grown immensely since 2010, spanning the humanities, social sciences, and engineering. We find that a substantial majority of studies in our sample lack a standardized form of ethical consideration, focus on specific constructs and have a rather narrow focus on specific social media platforms. Based on our findings, we discuss how computational elements have influenced mental health research, highlight academic gaps and suggest promising directions for future studies.

N2 - Stress is a major problem in our society today and poses major concerns for the future. It is important to gain an objective understanding of how average individuals respond to events they observe in typical environments they encounter. We developed a computational model of stress based on objective human responses collected from human observers of environments. In the process, we investigated whether a computational model can be developed to recognize observer stress in abstract virtual environments (text), virtual environments (films) and real environments (real-life settings) using physiological and physical response sensor signals. Our work proposes an architecture for a computational observer stress model. The architecture was used it to implement models for the different types of environments. Sensors appropriate to the different types of environment were investigated where the aims were to achieve unobtrusive methods for stress response signal collection, reduce encumbrance and hence, enhance methods to capture natural observer behaviors and produce stress models that recognized stress more robustly. We discuss the motivations for each investigation and detail the experiments we conducted to collect stress data sets for observers of the different types of environments. We describe individual-independent artificial neural network and support vector machine based model classifiers that were developed to recognize stress patterns from observer response signals. The classifiers were extended to include a genetic algorithm which was used to select features that were better for stress recognition and reduce the use of redundant features. The outcomes of this research provide a possible future extension on managing stress objectively.

N2 - Background. Learning programming is a cognitively demanding field of study accompanied with various difficulties. Although there is a high demand in the market for programmers, software analysts and engineers, a high dropout rate is recorded in relevant fields of study. Serious games are a promising means of engaging students in learning programming by giving them more incentives and making the process of learning programming concepts and languages more entertaining. Aim. This article introduces a new serious game called PY-RATE ADVENTURES, which aims to assist young students in their introduction to the basic programming concepts using Python. The game does not have any prerequisites and is suitable for players with no previous knowledge of programming. This article aims to present important information regarding the analysis, design and pilot evaluation of PY-RATE ADVENTURES. Method. The game was evaluated by 31 people that had recently graduated or were students of an Interdepartmental Programme of Postgraduate Studies in Information Systems. The participants voluntarily played the game and answered a questionnaire based on the MEEGA+ model, after their hands on experience with the game. This questionnaire’s purpose was to evaluate PY-RATE ADVENTURES in terms of perceived player experience and short-term learning. Results. The participants positively evaluated the game almost in all the elements of player experience. Furthermore, the majority of the users consider that the game helped them to learn basic programming concepts in Python and stated that they would prefer to learn programming with this game rather than other teaching methods. Conclusion. The positive results of the pilot evaluation give us the motivation to proceed and evaluate the game with students in secondary education, in order to extract stronger and generalisable conclusions regarding the impact of the game as an educational tool for learning programming concepts.

N2 - Psychiatric research is undergoing significant advances in an emerging subspeciality of computational psychiatry, building on cognitive neuroscience research by expanding to neurocomputational modeling. Here, we illustrate some research trends in this domain using work on proactive cognitive control deficits in schizophrenia as an example. We provide a selective review of formal modeling approaches to understanding cognitive control deficits in psychopathology, focusing primarily on biologically plausible connectionist-level models as well as mathematical models that generate parameter estimates of putatively dissociable psychological or neural processes. We illustrate some of the advantages of these models in terms of understanding both cognitive control deficits in schizophrenia and the potential roles of effort and motivation. Further, we highlight critical future directions for this work, including a focus on establishing psychometric properties, additional work modeling psychotic symptoms and their interaction with cognitive control, and the need to expand both behavioral and neural modeling to samples that include individuals with different mental health conditions, allowing for the examination of dissociable neural or psychological substrates for seemingly similar cognitive impairments across disorders.

N2 - Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) etiopathogenesis remains partially unexplained. The main conceptual framework used to study AD is the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis, although the failure of recent clinical experimentation seems to reduce its potential in AD research. Objective: A possible explanation for the failure of clinical trials is that they are set too late in AD progression. Recent studies suggest that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) degeneration could be one of the first events occurring in AD progression (pre-plaque stage). Methods: Here we investigate this hypothesis through a computational model and computer simulations validated with behavioral and neural data from patients. Results: We show that VTA degeneration might lead to system-level adjustments of catecholamine release, triggering a sequence of events leading to relevant clinical and pathological signs of AD. These changes consist first in a midfrontal-driven compensatory hyperactivation of both VTA and locus coeruleus (norepinephrine) followed, with the progression of the VTA impairment, by a downregulation of catecholamine release. These processes could then trigger the neural degeneration at the cortical and hippocampal levels, due to the chronic loss of the neuroprotective role of norepinephrine. Conclusion: Our novel hypothesis might contribute to the formulation of a wider system-level view of AD which might help to devise early diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

N2 - The size and variation in both meaning-making and populations that characterize much contemporary text data demand research processes that support both discovery, interpretation and measurement. We assess one dominant strategy within the social sciences that takes a computer-led approach to text analysis. The approach is coined computational grounded theory. This strategy, we argue, relies on a set of unwarranted assumptions, namely, that unsupervised models return natural clusters of meaning, that the researcher can understand text with limited immersion and that indirect validation is sufficient for ensuring unbiased and precise measurement. In response to this criticism, we develop a framework that is computer assisted. We argue that our reformulation of computational grounded theory better aligns with the principles within grounded theory, anthropological theory generation and ethnography.

N2 - Recent neuroscientific evidence in human and non-human primates indicates that the regions that become active during motor execution and motor observation overlap extensively in the cerebral cortex. This suggests that to observe an action, these primates employ their motor and somatosensation areas in order to simulate it internally. In line with this finding, in the current paper, we examine relevant neuroscientific evidence in order to design a computational agent that can facilitate observational learning of reaching movements. For this reason, we develop a novel motor control system, inspired from contemporary theories of motor control, and demonstrate how it can be used during observation to facilitate learning, without the active involvement of the agent’s body. Our results show that novel motor skills can be acquired only by observation, by optimizing the peripheral components of the agent’s motion.

N2 - This paper describes a computational model of optical flow and demonstrates how it can be used to estimate the navigation velocity of the user’s viewpoint during a virtual reality (VR) simulation. The model takes as input a VR simulation video sequence and outputs the estimated average navigation velocity. When this estimated velocity is integrated into the published cybersickness dose value model (CSDV: So, 1999), the severity level of the cybersickness associated with the VR simulation can be predicted. Results of two simulation studies indicated that the average navigation velocities in lateral and vertical axes can be estimated to within 10% error. The simulations used a virtual environment (VE) with a known single depth. Discussion of an extension of the computational model to accommodate VEs with unknown multiple depths is included. The reported model is consistent with the biological neuro-pathway of the perception of visual motion velocities in humans. The benefits associated with this consistency are discussed.

N2 - The purpose of the study was to compare the deficit profiles of two important types of mathematics difficulties. Three cognitive measures (working memory, processing speed, and reasoning), two mathematics measures (numerical facts retrieval and mathematics vocabulary), and reading comprehension were assessed among 237 Chinese fourth-grade students, among whom 28 were classified as students with only computational difficulties (CD), 34 were classified as having only word problem-solving difficulties (WPD), 20 were classified as students with computational and word problem-solving difficulties (CD + WPD), and 43 typically developing (TD) peers. Multivariate analysis showed that, compared with TD, CD was associated with weakness in numerical working memory; WPD was associated with weakness in reading comprehension; both CD and WPD were associated with weakness in mathematics vocabulary. However, CD and WPD did not differ from each other on any of those profiling measures. Implications for understanding mathematics competence and identification of mathematics difficulties are discussed.

N2 - In this article, Fishbone-based advanced computational thinking (FACT) pedagogy is proposed by fusing fishbone pedagogy and computational thinking pedagogy for enhancing teaching-learning process while teaching engineering and science courses, for engineering and science students respectively. The proposed FACT pedagogy has been implemented using the concept of X-ray machine in biomedical instrumentation course and biomolecules, in biochemistry course. Using fishbone approach, various components of X-ray machine in biomedical course and the components of biomolecules in biochemistry course are visually explained as ribs and riblets of a fishbone diagram, without coining the keywords X-ray and biomolecules in an engineering institution and science institution respectively. Finally, the targeted concept is arrived and explained. Similarly, the same concepts of X-ray and biomolecules are coined among students and they are asked to divide or decompose the concepts into sub-concepts separately. To implement and evaluate the proposed pedagogy, an engineering institution and a science institution have been selected and evaluation results have been published in this article. In this pedagogical approach, the same complex concept is taught as a backward thinking by the teacher using fishbone pedagogy and forward thinking by the students using computational thinking pedagogy. This combined approach helps students to understand any complex concept in science courses. Also, it helps the teachers to easily convey and embed the same among the student community while teaching science courses.

N2 - Creativity and Computational Thinking (CT) have been both extensively researched in recent years. However, the associations between them are still not fully understood despite their recognition as essential competencies for the digital age. This study looks to bridge this gap by examining the association between CT and two types of creativity, i.e., Creative Thinking and Computational Creativity. The research was conducted among 124 middle school students from Spain, who were divided into control and experimental groups; the intervention included an explicit encouragement to be as creative as possible (i.e., to submit multiple correct solutions) in a given learning task. Data were analyzed from a standardized creativity test (Torrance’s TTCT) and cross-referenced with log files that documented the students’ activities in the Kodetu game-based learning environment. Our research findings indicate some interesting associations between CT and Creativity. First, we found that creativity contributes to CT. Second, we found that CT is transferable across different domains. Finally, we found that Computational Creativity can develop and improve over time.

N2 - There are increasing calls to introduce computational thinking in schools; the arguments in favor call upon research suggesting that even kindergarten children can successfully engage in coding. This contribution presents a cross-sectional study examining the coding practices and computational thinking of fifty-one primary school children using the ScratchJr software; children were organized in two cohorts (Cohort 1: 6–9 years old; Cohort 2: 10–12 years old). Each cohort participated in a six-hour intervention, as part of a four-day summer club. During the intervention children were introduced to ScratchJr and were asked to collaboratively design a digital story about environmental waste management actions, thus adopting a disciplinary perspective to computational thinking. Data analyses examined children’s final artifacts, in terms of coding practices and the level of computational thinking demonstrated by each cohort. Furthermore, analysis of selected groups’ storyboard interviews was used to shed light on differences between the two cohorts. Results are presented and contrasted across the two age cohorts via a developmental perspective. The findings of this study can be useful in considering the instructional support that is necessary to scaffold the development of primary school children’s coding practices and computational thinking.

N2 - This study describes the development and validation process of a computational thinking (CT) test for adults. The team designed a set of items and explored a subset of those through two qualitative pilots. Then, in order to provide validity evidence based on the test content, a team of 11 subject-matter experts coded the initial pool of items using two different systems of categories based on CT components and contents. Next, the items were piloted on a sample of 289 participants, 137 experts in CT, and 152 novices. After a series of confirmatory factor analyses, a unidimensional model that represents algorithmic thinking was adopted. Further analyzing the psychometric quality of the 27 items, 20 of them with excellent reliability indices were selected for the test. Thus, this study provides a tool to evaluate adults’ CT: the Algorithmic Thinking Test for Adults (ATTA), which was developed according to psychometric standards. This article also reflects on the nature of CT as a construct.

N2 - As a dynamic and multifaceted construct, computational thinking (CT) has proven to be challenging to conceptualize and assess, which impedes the development of a workable ontology framework. To address this issue, the current article describes a novel approach towards understanding the ontological aspects of CT by using text mining and graph-theoretic techniques to elucidate teachers’ perspectives collected in an online survey (N = 105). In particular, a hierarchical cluster analysis, a knowledge representation method, was applied to identify sub-groups in CT conceptualization and assessment amongst teachers. Five clusters in conceptualization and two clusters in assessment were identified; several relevant and distinct themes were also extracted. The results suggested that teachers attributed CT as a competence domain, relevant in the problem- solving context, as well as applicable and transferrable to various disciplines. The results also shed light on the importance of using multiple approaches to assess the diversity of CT. Overall, the findings collectively contributed to a comprehensive and multi-perspective representation of CT that refine both theory and practice. The methodology employed in this article has suggested a minor but significant step towards addressing the quintessential questions of “what is CT?” and “how is it evidenced?”.

N2 - In the context of digital technologies, computational thinking (CT) is considered a key competence of primary school teachers. However, assessment tools to measure in-service teachers’ CT competence are rare. The current study explains the design, development, and validation of a scale to determine the in-service teachers’ mastery level of their Computational Thinking Competence (CTC) in the Chinese context. The validity and reliability of the scale have been studied by conducting exploratory factor analysis (EFA), confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and calculating internal consistency coefficients. The sample of this study consisted of 631 in-service teachers from different Chinese primary schools (EFA N = 189; CFA N = 442). The 31-item scale mirrors five factors: cognitive knowledge of CT, practices and skills of CT, attitudes and perspectives of CT, CT teaching design, and CT teaching implementation. The discussion of the results looks at the future use of the CT scale in Chinese educational settings that mirror a specific national education policy, talent demand, and educational culture.

N2 - In this work, we examine whether repeated participation in an after-school computing program influenced student learning of computational thinking concepts, practices, and perspectives. We also examine gender differences in learning outcomes. The program was developed through a school–university partnership. Data were collected from 138 students over a 2.5-year period. Data sources included pre–post content assessments of computational concepts related to programming in addition to computational artifacts and interviews with a purposeful sample of 12 participants. Quantitative data were analyzed using statistical methods to identify gains in pre- and post-learning of computational thinking concepts and examine potential gender differences. Interview data were analyzed qualitatively. Results indicated that students made significant gains in their learning of computational thinking concepts and that gains persisted over time. Results also revealed differences in learning of computational thinking concepts among boys and girls both at the beginning and end of the program. Finally, results from student interviews provided insights into the development of computational thinking practices and perspectives over time. Results have implications for the design of after-school computing programs that help broaden participation in computing.

N2 - Computational thinking (CT) is considered a fundamental skill that everyone in the 21st century should have. Game-based learning (GBL) may be used to teach CT, and it’s necessary to clarify how to design and implement game-based CT teaching. The literature was systematically searched for empirical studies published between 2011 and 2021. Thirty-nine studies were included in the review and findings suggested that GBL has positive effects on CT, but has non-significant effects on some CT elements (e.g., conditions, triggers, and abstraction) because of limited time to learn these elements and students’ preferences for using CT elements. Game elements, particularly clear goals and rules, progressive challenges, immediate feedback, storyline, avatar, social interaction and various reward mechanisms were used to motivate students to engage in activities to develop CT. Furthermore, single or multiple theoretical foundations, such as constructivist learning theory and experiential learning theory, may guide the design and implementation of game-based activities. Problem-solving, project-based approaches were used to encourage students to use CT to solve problems or complete a project. Finally, guidelines for designing and implementing game-based learning activities for promoting CT were discussed.

N2 - In the past decade, Computational Thinking (CT) education has received growing attention from researchers. Although many reviews have provided synthesized information on CT teaching and learning, few have paid particular attention to collaborative learning (CL) strategies. CL has been widely implemented in CT classes and has become the most popular pedagogy among educators. Therefore, a systematic review of CL in CT classes would provide practical guidance on teaching strategies to enhance CT interventions and improve the quality of teaching and learning, ultimately benefiting students’ CT skills development. To address this gap, this study examined 43 empirical studies that have applied CL strategies, ranging from 2006 to 2022. Several findings were revealed in the analysis. First, a wide range of theories and frameworks were applied to inform research questions, pedagogical design, and research methodologies. Second, despite the acknowledged importance of group composition in effective CL, a large number of studies did not provide details on how the students were grouped. Third, six types of CL activities and instructional designs have been identified in CT classrooms. The synthesized information provides valuable insights that can inform future research directions and guide the design and implementation of CL activities in future CT classes.

N2 - Purpose To analyze mathematics problem-solving (PS) procedures in Chinese (CH) and Canadian (CA) elementary mathematics textbooks that leverage computational thinking (CT) as a cognitive tool, which have evidently existed and been implemented. Design/Approach/Methods In this study, an analysis framework was developed to investigate the characteristics of CT tools for three PS steps—understand the problem, devise and conduct plans, and look back into textbooks—in four contexts: data practices, modeling and simulation practices, computational tools practices, and systemic thinking practices. Findings Our results demonstrate the tools (CT) employed in the PS process in CH and CA mathematics textbooks. The strong connections between the “look back” stage and CT tools were explored. During the “look back” stage, both countries required students to transfer their knowledge and perform generalization. In addition, CT is regarded as a basic skill analysis for students in mathematics education and has received significant attention at every stage of the PS process. Originality/Value This study brings a new perspective to CT research in education by regarding CT as a cognitive tool for students in mathematics PS.

N2 - In the last 20 years, a new approach has emerged to investigate the physiopathology of circulation. By merging medical images with validated numerical models, it is possible to support doctors’ decision-making process. The iCardioCloud project aims at establishing a computational framework to perform a complete patient-specific numerical analysis, specially oriented to aortic diseases (like dissections or aneurysms) and to deliver a compelling synthesis. The project can be considered a pioneering example of a Computer Aided Clinical Trial: i.e., a comprehensive analysis of patients where the level of knowledge extracted by traditional measures and statistics is enhanced through the massive use of numerical modeling. From a computer engineering point of view, iCardioCloud faces multiple challenges. First, the number of problems to solve for each patient is significantly huge – this is typical of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) – and it requires parallel methods. In addition, working in a clinical environment demands efficiency as the timeline requires rapid quantitative answers (as may happen in an emergency scenario). It is therefore mandatory to employ high-end parallel systems, such as large clusters or supercomputers. Here we discuss a parallel implementation of an application within the iCardioCloud project, built with a black-box approach – i.e., by assembling and configuring existing packages and libraries and in particular LifeV, a finite element library developed to solve CFD problems. The goal of this paper is to describe the software architecture underlying LifeV and to assess its performance and the most appropriate parallel paradigm. This paper is an extension of a previous work presented at the PBio 2015 Conference. This revision extends the description of the software architecture and discusses several new serial and parallel optimizations to the application. We discuss the introduction of hybrid parallelism in order to mitigate some performance problems previously experienced.

N2 - In computational fluid dynamics models for hemodynamics applications, boundary conditions remain one of the major issues in obtaining accurate fluid flow predictions. For major cardiovascular models, the realistic boundary conditions are not available. In order to address this issue, the whole computational domain needs to be modeled, which is practically impossible. For simulating fully developed turbulent flows using the large eddy simulation and dynamic numerical solution methods, which are very popular in hemodynamics studies, periodic boundary conditions are suitable. This is mainly because the computational domain can be reduced considerably. In this study, a novel periodic boundary condition is proposed, which is based on mass flow condition. The proposed boundary condition is applied on a square duct for the sake of validation. The mass-based condition was shown to obtain the solution in 15% less time. As such, the mass-based condition has two decisive advantages: first, the solution for a given Reynolds number can be obtained in a single simulation because of the direct specification of the mass flow, and second, simulations can be made more quickly.

N2 - Mixing and combustion of engine combustion network Spray A after end of injection are modeled using highly resolved multidimensional numerical simulations to explore the physics underlying recent experimental observations of combustion recession. Reacting spray simulations are performed using a traditional Lagrangian–Eulerian coupled formulation for two-phase mixture transport with a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes approach using the open-source computational fluid dynamics code OpenFOAM. Chemical kinetics models for n-dodecane by Cai et al. and Yao et al. are deployed to evaluate the impact of mechanism formulation and low-temperature chemistry on predictions of combustion recession behavior. Simulations with the Cai mechanism show that under standard Spray A conditions, the end-of-injection transient induces second-stage ignition in distinct regions near the nozzle that are initially spatially separated from the lifted diffusion flame, but then rapidly merge with flame. By contrast, the Yao mechanism fails to predict sufficient low-temperature chemistry in mixtures upstream of the diffusion flame during the end-of-injection transient and does not predict combustion recession for the same conditions. The effects of the shape and duration of the end-of-injection transient on the entrainment wave near the nozzle, the likelihood of combustion recession, and the spatiotemporal development of mixing and chemistry in near-nozzle mixtures are also investigated. With a more rapid ramp-down injection profile (ramp-down duration < 400 µs), a weaker combustion recession occurs earlier in time after the start of ramp-down. For extremely fast ramp-down (ramp-down duration = 0), the entrainment flux varies rapidly near the nozzle and over-leaning of the mixture completely suppresses combustion recession. For a slower ramp-down profile with respect to the standard Spray A condition, complete combustion recession back toward the nozzle is observed and combustion recession occurred later in time. Simulations qualitatively agreed with the past experimental and modeling observations of combustion recession with different end-of-injection transients.

N2 - Predictive toxicology plays a critical role in reducing the failure rate of new drugs in pharmaceutical research and development. Despite recent gains in our understanding of drug-induced toxicity, however, it is urgent that the utility and limitations of our current predictive tools be determined in order to identify gaps in our understanding of mechanistic and chemical toxicology. Using recently published computational regression analyses of in vitro and in vivo toxicology data, it will be demonstrated that significant gaps remain in early safety screening paradigms. More strategic analyses of these data sets will allow for a better understanding of their domain of applicability and help identify those compounds that cause significant in vivo toxicity but which are currently mis-predicted by in silico and in vitro models. These ‘outliers’ and falsely predicted compounds are metaphorical lighthouses that shine light on existing toxicological knowledge gaps, and it is essential that these compounds are investigated if attrition is to be reduced significantly in the future. As such, the modern computational toxicologist is more productively engaged in understanding these gaps and driving investigative toxicology towards addressing them.

N2 - This article presents a computational approach to examining immigrant incorporation through shifts in the social “mainstream.” Analyzing a historical corpus of American etiquette books, texts from 1922–2017 describing social norms, we identify mainstream shifts related to long-standing groups which once were and may currently still be seen as immigrant outsiders in the United States: Catholic, Chinese, Irish, Italian, Jewish, Mexican, and Muslim groups. The analysis takes a computational grounded theory approach, combining qualitative readings and computational text analyses. Using word embeddings, we operationalize the chosen groups as focal group concepts. We extract sections of text that are salient to the focal group concepts to create group-specific text corpora. Two computational approaches make it possible to examine mainstream shifts in these corpora. First, we use sentiment analysis to observe the positive sentiment in each corpus and its change over time. Second, we observe changes in each corpus’s position on a semantic dimension represented by the poles of “strange” and “normal.” The results indicate mainstream shifts through increases in positive sentiment and movement from strange to normal over time for most of the group-specific corpora. These research techniques can be adapted to other studies of social sentiment and symbolic inclusion.

N2 - Conflict management is one of the most important issues in leveraging organizational competitiveness. However, traditional social scientists built theories or models in this area which were mostly expressed in words and diagrams are insufficient. Social science research based on computational modeling and simulation is beginning to augment traditional theory building. Simulation provides a method for people to try their actions out in a way that is cost effective, faster, appropriate, flexible, and ethical. In this paper, a computational simulation model for conflict management in team building is presented. The model is designed and used to explore the individual performances related to the combination of individuals who have a range of conflict handling styles, under various types of resources and policies. The model is developed based on agent-based modeling method. Each of the agents has one of the five conflict handling styles: accommodation, compromise, competition, contingency, and learning. There are three types of scenarios: normal, convex, and concave. There are two types of policies: no policy, and a reward and punishment policy. Results from running the model are also presented. The simulation has led us to derive two implications concerning conflict management. First, a concave type of resource promotes competition, while convex type of resource promotes compromise and collaboration. Second, the performance ranking of different styles can be influenced by introducing different policies. On the other hand, it is possible for us to promote certain style by introducing different policies.

N2 - In musicology, there has been a long debate about a meaningful partitioning and description of music history regarding composition styles. Particularly, concepts of historical periods have been criticized since they cannot account for the continuous and interwoven evolution of style. To systematically study this evolution, large corpora are necessary suggesting the use of computational strategies. This article presents such strategies and experiments relying on a dataset of 2000 audio recordings, which cover more than 300 years of music history. From the recordings, we extract different tonal features. We propose a method to visualize these features over the course of history using evolution curves. With the curves, we re-trace hypotheses concerning the evolution of chord transitions, intervals, and tonal complexity. Furthermore, we perform unsupervised clustering of recordings across composition years, individual pieces, and composers. In these studies, we found independent evidence of historical periods that broadly agrees with traditional views as well as recent data-driven experiments. This shows that computational experiments can provide novel insights into the evolution of styles.

N2 - Hydrodynamic effects of mussel farms have attracted increased research attentions in recent years. The understanding of the hydrodynamic impacts is essential for predicting the sustainability of mussel farms. A large mussel farm includes thousands of mussel droppers, and the combined drag on the mussel droppers is sufficient to possibly affect the longevity of the entire long-lines. This article intends to study the drag and wake of an individual long-line mussel dropper using computational fluid dynamics approaches. Two equivalent rough cylinders, namely, Curved-Model and Sharp-Model, have been utilized to simulate the mussel dropper, and each rough cylinder is assigned with surface roughness. The porosity is not considered in this article due to its complexity from inhalant and exhalant of mussels. Two-dimensional laminar simulations are conducted at Reynolds number from 10 to 200, and three-dimensional large eddy simulations are conducted at subcritical Reynolds number ranging from 3900 to . The results show that larger drag coefficients and Strouhal numbers are attributed to surface roughness and sharp crowns on the rough cylinder. The obtained drag coefficient ranges from 1.1 to 1.2 with respect to the diameter of the mussel dropper and the peak value of the tidal velocities. Wakes behind rough cylinders fluctuate more actively compared to those of smooth cylinders. This research work provides new insight for further investigations on hydrodynamic interactions between fluid and mussel droppers.

N2 - The social identity approach suggests that group prototypical individuals have greater influence over fellow group members. This effect has been well-studied offline. Here, we use a novel method of assessing prototypicality in naturally occurring data to test whether this effect can be replicated in online communities. In Study 1a (N = 53,049 Reddit users), we train a linguistic measure of prototypicality for two social groups: libertarians and entrepreneurs. We then validate this measure further to ensure it is not driven by demographics (Study 1b: N = 882) or local accommodation (Study 1c: N = 1,684 Silk Road users). In Study 2 (N = 8,259), we correlate this measure of prototypicality with social network indicators of social influence. In line with the social identity approach, individuals who are more prototypical generate more responses from others. Implications for testing sociopsychological theories with naturally occurring data using computational approaches are discussed.

N2 - A robust approach to computational kinematics intended to cope with algorithmic singularities is introduced in this article. The approach is based on the reduction of the original system of equations to a subsystem of bivariate equations, as opposed to the multivariate polynomial reduction leading to the characteristic univariate polynomial. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated for the exact function-generation synthesis of planar, spherical, and spatial four-bar linkages. Some numerical examples are provided for the case of the spherical four-bar function generator with six precision points to show the benefits of the proposed method with respect to methods reported in the literature.

N2 - Stainless steel alloys are widely used in many important applications but their production presents difficulties because they contain expensive chromium, which can be extensively oxidised during decarburisation to the very low carbon levels required. Modern stainless steelmaking largely avoids this problem by having two distinct stages and is therefore described as duplex practice. Molten high carbon stainless steel is produced in an electric arc furnace and then the melt is decarburised in an argon–oxygen converter or a vacuum oxygen decarburising converter. In this work, computational thermodynamics has been used to examine the major reactions occurring in the electric arc furnace and to show the effect of various process variables on chromium recovery. It was shown that significant oxidation of the scrap must occur during melting, and that subsequent carbon/oxygen injection initially oxidises some chromium, but then mostly oxidises the added carbon. Chromium was predicted to exist in the slag as CrO and CrO1·5 in almost equal proportions. Increasing the temperature should improve chromium recovery but results in less benefit than expected due to the decreasing activity coefficients of CrO and CrO1·5 and the increasing oxygen partial pressure. Ferrosilicon additions reduce chromium oxides from the slag, but much of the silicon simply dissolves into the steel. Computational thermodynamics is seen to be a very effective educational tool for gaining an understanding of smelting processes.

N2 - This study implemented and evaluated the innovative use of a performance-based assessment platform to support the development of self-regulated learning (SRL) in senior primary students as they completed programming tasks. We embedded SRL support features into a performance-based assessment platform as scaffolding to help the students implement problem-solving strategies. A mixed-methods approach was adopted to evaluate the intervention. The students’ perceptions of their SRL skills after working through the programming tasks were measured by a survey of 45 students. The quantitative results suggested that the students benefited from the performance-based assessment platform in developing their SRL skills. A thematic analysis of interview data from 20 students further indicated that the embedded SRL scaffolding and automatic marking function helped them to solve the programming tasks. The results demonstrate that a well-designed performance-based assessment platform with embedded SRL support can be an effective tool for developing students’ SRL. The qualitative results further revealed that algorithmic thinking is an aspect of programming for which students need more SRL support.

N2 - We developed a novel concept of endovascular thrombolysis that employs a vibrating electroactive polymer actuator. In order to predict the efficacy of thrombolysis using the developed vibrating actuator, enzyme (plasminogen activator) perfusion into a clot was analyzed by solving flow fields and species transport equations considering the fluid structure interaction. In vitro thrombolysis experiments were also performed. Computational results showed that plasminogen activator perfusion into a clot was enhanced by actuator vibration at frequencies of 1 and 5 Hz. Plasminogen activator perfusion was affected by the actuator oscillation frequencies and amplitudes that were determined by electromechanical characteristics of a polymer actuator. Computed plasminogen activator perfused volumes were compared with experimentally measured dissolved clot volumes. The computed plasminogen activator perfusion volumes with threshold concentrations of 16% of the initial plasminogen activator concentration agreed well with the in vitro experimental data. This study showed the effectiveness of actuator oscillation on thrombolysis and the validity of the computational plasminogen activator perfusion model for predicting thrombolysis in complex flow fields induced by an oscillating actuator.

N2 - Abstract Experimental data from internal combustion (IC) engines suggests that the use of proprietary computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes for the prediction of coolant-side heat transfer within IC engine coolant jackets often results in underprediction of the convective heat transfer coefficient. An experimental and computational study, based on a coolant gallery simulator rig designed specifically to reproduce realistic IC engine operating conditions, has been conducted to explore this issue. It is shown that the standard ‘wall function’ approach normally used in CFD models to model near-wall conditions does not adequately represent some features of the flow that are relevant in convective heat transfer. Alternative modelling approaches are explored to account for these shortcomings and an empirical approach is shown to be successful; however, the methodology is not easily transferable to other situations.

N2 - Several flow visualization techniques using the Lagran gian approach are proposed for analyzing the numerical solutions of unsteady flow fields computed by the Eu lerian approach. We show how these methods can be used to assess the validity of solutions and to extract the nature of the flow fields. The numerical algorithms for the flow solver and the flow visualization are introduced. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved using the extended MAC method and the compressible Euler equations are solved using the TVD MacCormack method. Most of the flow visualization methods are conventional. For vector fields, however, we introduce a particle tracing algorithm that is suitable for large amounts of numerical data. We present four flow visu alizations using these methods: flow past a circular cyl inder in two dimensions, shock wave propagation over a circular cylinder, flow past a sphere, and flow around an entire automobile.

N2 - Theories are the core of any science, but many imprecisely stated theories in organizational and management science are hampering progress in the field. Computational modeling of existing theories can help address the issue. Computational models are a type of formal theory that are represented mathematically or by other formal logic and can be simulated, allowing theorists to assess whether the theory can explain the phenomena intended as well as make testable predictions. As an example of the process, Locke’s integrated model of work motivation is translated into static and dynamic computational models. Simulations of these models are compared to the empirical data used to develop and test the theory. For the static model, the simulations revealed largely strong associations with robust empirical findings. However, adding dynamics created several challenges to key precepts of the theory. Moreover, the effort revealed where empirical work is needed to further refine or refute the theory. Discussion focuses on the value of computational modeling as a method for formally testing, pruning, and extending extant theories in the field.

N2 - In this study, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation was adopted to evaluate the valve-induced water hammer phenomena in a typical tank-pipeline-valve-tank system. Meanwhile, one-dimensional analysis based on method of characteristics was also used for comparison and reference. As for the computational fluid dynamics model, the water hammer event was successfully simulated by using the sliding mesh technology and considering water compressibility. The key factors affecting simulation results were investigated in detail. It is found that the size of time step has an obvious effect on the attenuation of the wave and there exists a best time step. The obtained simulation results have a good agreement with the experimental data, which shows an unquestionable advantage over the method of characteristics calculation in predicting valve-induced water hammer. In addition, the computational fluid dynamics simulation can also provide a visualization of the pressure and flow evolutions during the transient process.

N2 - Model uncertainty is pervasive in social science. A key question is how robust empirical results are to sensible changes in model specification. We present a new approach and applied statistical software for computational multimodel analysis. Our approach proceeds in two steps: First, we estimate the modeling distribution of estimates across all combinations of possible controls as well as specified functional form issues, variable definitions, standard error calculations, and estimation commands. This allows analysts to present their core, preferred estimate in the context of a distribution of plausible estimates. Second, we develop a model influence analysis showing how each model ingredient affects the coefficient of interest. This shows which model assumptions, if any, are critical to obtaining an empirical result. We demonstrate the architecture and interpretation of multimodel analysis using data on the union wage premium, gender dynamics in mortgage lending, and tax flight migration among U.S. states. These illustrate how initial results can be strongly robust to alternative model specifications or remarkably dependent on a knife-edge specification.

N2 - As part of a recent animal facility refurbishment, a cubicle containment system was designed to increase the amount of experimental space and also provide containment facilities to support the holding and use of specialized animal models. In order to achieve this, a series of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) studies was undertaken to evaluate the effects of different airflows and in order to optimize ventilation, a variety of exhaust/supply arrangements and animal loads was employed. These studies showed that air delivered via two, opposed, low level ducts, at a rate of 20 air changes per hour and exhausted high in the cubicle above the rack, was the optimal configuration resulting in minimal turbulence, stagnation and entrainment.

N2 - Is the relationship between criminal thinking and recidivism the same for criminal justice–involved individuals from varying demographic backgrounds? Relying on two independent samples of offenders and two measures of criminal thinking, the current studies examined whether four demographic factors—gender, race, age, and education—moderated the relationship between criminal thinking and recidivism. Study 1 consisted of 226 drug-involved probationers enrolled in a randomized clinical trial. Study 2 consisted of 346 jail inmates from a longitudinal study. Logistic regression models suggested that the strength of the relationship between criminal thinking and subsequent recidivism did not vary based on participant demographics, regardless of justice system setting or measure of criminal thinking. Criminal thinking predicts recidivism similarly for people who are male, female, Black, White, older, younger, and more or less educated.

N2 - The application of a previously developed computational method to the prediction of high-lift performance for multi-element aerofoil sections operating at transonic flow conditions is described. The flows are computed by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, using a full differential Reynolds-stress turbulence model to evaluate the various Reynolds-stress components appearing in the governing mean-flow equations. Algebraic wall functions are used to bridge the molecular viscosity-dominated region immediately adjacent to the aerofoil surfaces. An unstructured grid-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology is used to deal with the geometric complexity of the multi-element aerofoil configurations. Initial results are presented for the viscous, transonic flow development around the SKF 1.1 supercritical aerofoil section, equipped with either a trailing-edge flap or a leading-edge slat. Predicted surface pressure distributions generally compare well with experimental data for the two high-lift aerofoil geometries considered, at a free-stream Mach number of 0.6 and over a range of incidence angles. There are some discrepancies in the regions immediately downstream of shock wave/boundary layer interactions, possibly resulting from the use of wall-function boundary conditions in the computations. Predicted Mach number contours indicate the complexity of the transonic flow fields for high-lift configurations, with the slat wake passing through an extensive supersonic-flow region, terminated by a normal shock wave, on the main aerofoil upper surface, for example.

N2 - This article analyzes the configuration of fear generated by the computational monster in computer games. We view the monster as a computational entity, which we approach through our theory of game-play coupled with the concepts of loss aversion and endowment effect. Of particular interest is player perception of the threat posed by monsters as they perturb the experience of progression and the sensation of control within the game. We scrutinize this aspect from a situational as well as an existential perspective. Furthermore, we advance an analytical scheme of the threat of the computational monster, which is radically different from the traditional academic approach with its emphasis on the representation of monsters. Overall, we argue that the threat players perceive when facing monsters in computer games springs more from the computational nature of monsters—how they upset progression and the feeling of control—and less from the representation of the monster(s).

N2 - Stainless steel alloys are widely used in many important applications but their production presents difficulties because they contain expensive chromium, which can be extensively oxidised during decarburisation to the very low carbon levels required. Modern stainless steelmaking largely avoids this problem by having two distinct stages and is therefore described as duplex practice. Molten high carbon stainless steel is produced in an electric arc furnace and then the melt is decarburised in an argon–oxygen converter or a vacuum oxygen decarburising converter. In this work, computational thermodynamics has been used to examine the major reactions occurring in the electric arc furnace and to show the effect of various process variables on chromium recovery. It was shown that significant oxidation of the scrap must occur during melting, and that subsequent carbon/oxygen injection initially oxidises some chromium, but then mostly oxidises the added carbon. Chromium was predicted to exist in the slag as CrO and CrO1·5 in almost equal proportions. Increasing the temperature should improve chromium recovery but results in less benefit than expected due to the decreasing activity coefficients of CrO and CrO1·5 and the increasing oxygen partial pressure. Ferrosilicon additions reduce chromium oxides from the slag, but much of the silicon simply dissolves into the steel. Computational thermodynamics is seen to be a very effective educational tool for gaining an understanding of smelting processes.

N2 - We developed a novel concept of endovascular thrombolysis that employs a vibrating electroactive polymer actuator. In order to predict the efficacy of thrombolysis using the developed vibrating actuator, enzyme (plasminogen activator) perfusion into a clot was analyzed by solving flow fields and species transport equations considering the fluid structure interaction. In vitro thrombolysis experiments were also performed. Computational results showed that plasminogen activator perfusion into a clot was enhanced by actuator vibration at frequencies of 1 and 5 Hz. Plasminogen activator perfusion was affected by the actuator oscillation frequencies and amplitudes that were determined by electromechanical characteristics of a polymer actuator. Computed plasminogen activator perfused volumes were compared with experimentally measured dissolved clot volumes. The computed plasminogen activator perfusion volumes with threshold concentrations of 16% of the initial plasminogen activator concentration agreed well with the in vitro experimental data. This study showed the effectiveness of actuator oscillation on thrombolysis and the validity of the computational plasminogen activator perfusion model for predicting thrombolysis in complex flow fields induced by an oscillating actuator.

N2 - Abstract Experimental data from internal combustion (IC) engines suggests that the use of proprietary computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes for the prediction of coolant-side heat transfer within IC engine coolant jackets often results in underprediction of the convective heat transfer coefficient. An experimental and computational study, based on a coolant gallery simulator rig designed specifically to reproduce realistic IC engine operating conditions, has been conducted to explore this issue. It is shown that the standard ‘wall function’ approach normally used in CFD models to model near-wall conditions does not adequately represent some features of the flow that are relevant in convective heat transfer. Alternative modelling approaches are explored to account for these shortcomings and an empirical approach is shown to be successful; however, the methodology is not easily transferable to other situations.

N2 - To design a comfortable aircraft cabin environment, designers conventionally follow an iterative guess-and-correction procedure to determine the air-supply parameters. The conventional method has an extremely low efficiency but does not guarantee an optimal design. This investigation proposed an inverse design method based on a proper orthogonal decomposition of the thermo-flow data provided by full computational fluid dynamics simulations. The orthogonal spatial modes of the thermo-flow fields and corresponding coefficients were firstly extracted. Then, a thermo-flow field was expressed into a linear combination of the spatial modes with their coefficients. The coefficients for each spatial mode are functions of air-supply parameters, which can be interpolated. With a quick map of the cause–effect relationship between the air-supply parameters and the exhibited thermo-flow fields, the optimal air-supply parameters were determined from specific design targets. By setting the percentage of dissatisfied and the predicted mean vote as design targets, the proposed method was implemented for inverse determination of air-supply parameters in two aircraft cabins. The results show that the inverse design using computational fluid dynamics-based proper orthogonal decomposition method is viable. Most of computing time lies in the construction of data samples of thermo-flow fields, while the proper orthogonal decomposition analysis and data interpolation is efficient.

N2 - Model uncertainty is pervasive in social science. A key question is how robust empirical results are to sensible changes in model specification. We present a new approach and applied statistical software for computational multimodel analysis. Our approach proceeds in two steps: First, we estimate the modeling distribution of estimates across all combinations of possible controls as well as specified functional form issues, variable definitions, standard error calculations, and estimation commands. This allows analysts to present their core, preferred estimate in the context of a distribution of plausible estimates. Second, we develop a model influence analysis showing how each model ingredient affects the coefficient of interest. This shows which model assumptions, if any, are critical to obtaining an empirical result. We demonstrate the architecture and interpretation of multimodel analysis using data on the union wage premium, gender dynamics in mortgage lending, and tax flight migration among U.S. states. These illustrate how initial results can be strongly robust to alternative model specifications or remarkably dependent on a knife-edge specification.

N2 - Purpose This article takes a postfoundational lens to reflect upon my ethnographic (re)searching experience in a Hong Kong high school biology classroom to expose ignorant theoretical–methodological assumptions of researchers and teachers on critical thinking for new realizations. Design/Approach/Methods Using an encountered embodied thinking moment as a trigger, this article examines the texts/discourses collected from teachers/teaching and students/learning to unpack underlying philosophical–theoretical–methodological traps and ignorance. Findings The analysis exposes three ignorant assumptions. First is a mind–body dualism that has historically disembodied thinking as an abstract and invisible mind/cognitive activity. Second is a knowledge–skill/thinking divide that upgrades critical thinking as a transferrable higher-order skill above and external to knowledge. Third is a naturalized assumption that didactic instructions in Asian classrooms are not as conducive to thinking cultivation as (Western) student-centered pedagogies. Originality/Value My postfoundational reflections interrogate and expand these philosophical–theoretical–methodological grounds to reconstruct effective thinking curricula and classrooms.

N2 - All operations in process metallurgy involve complex phenomena comprising momentum, heat, and/or mass transport; iron- and steelmaking is not an exception. Transport phenomena, i.e. fluid flows, heat transfer and mass transfer, play a dominant role in process metallurgy since their respective laws govern the kinetics of the various physical phenomena occurring in ironmaking and in steelmaking. These phenomena include such events as three-phase reactions, entrainment of slag and gas in liquid steel, vacuum degassing, alloy melting and mixing, the movements and flotation of inclusions, melt temperature losses, residence times in a metallurgical reactor, erosion of refractory linings, etc. In all these aspects, the evolution in our techniques and abilities to model single and multiphase flows and their attendant heat and mass transfer processes has contributed significantly to our understanding and effectively operating these processes, to designing improvements, and to developing new processes. To be ignorant of these matters can doom a processing operation to the scrap heap of metallurgical failures. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational heat and mass transfer has been a very effective tool over the last three decades, for modelling iron- and steelmaking processes, starting from the blast furnace up to continuous casting and beyond. With the advent of commercial CFD packages and ever increasing computational power through parallel processing, CFD has now become the dominant approach for predicting various aspects in iron- and steelmaking processes. In Part 1 of this review paper, the applications of CFD in ironmaking processes are thoroughly reviewed, discussed and critiqued. In Part 2, fluid flows and CFD in steelmaking and steel casting processes are similarly reviewed and critiqued.

N2 - Background Past studies reported a low correlation between rhinomanometry and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but the source of the discrepancy was unclear. Low correlation or lack of correlation has also been reported between subjective and objective measures of nasal patency. Objective: This study investigates (1) the correlation and agreement between nasal resistance derived from CFD (RCFD) and rhinomanometry (RRMN), and (2) the correlation between objective and subjective measures of nasal patency. Methods Twenty-five patients with nasal obstruction underwent anterior rhinomanometry before and after mucosal decongestion with oxymetazoline. Subjective nasal patency was assessed with a 0-10 visual analog scale (VAS). CFD simulations were performed based on computed tomography scans obtained after mucosal decongestion. To validate the CFD methods, nasal resistance was measured in vitro (REXPERIMENT) by performing pressure-flow experiments in anatomically accurate plastic nasal replicas from 6 individuals. Results Mucosal decongestion was associated with a reduction in bilateral nasal resistance (0.34 ± 0.23 Pa.s/ml to 0.19 ± 0.24 Pa.s/ml, p = 0.003) and improved sensation of nasal airflow (bilateral VAS decreased from 5.2 ± 1.9 to 2.6 ± 1.9, p < 0.001). A statistically significant correlation was found between VAS in the most obstructed cavity and unilateral airflow before and after mucosal decongestion (r = −0.42, p = 0.003). Excellent correlation was found between RCFD and REXPERIMENT (r = 0.96, p < 0.001) with good agreement between the numerical and in vitro values (RCFD/REXPERIMENT = 0.93 ± 0.08). A weak correlation was found between RCFD and RRMN (r = 0.41, p = 0.003) with CFD underpredicting nasal resistance derived from rhinomanometry (RCFD/RRMN = 0.65 ± 0.63). A stronger correlation was found when unilateral airflow at a pressure drop of 75 Pa was used to compare CFD with rhinomanometry (r = 0.76, p < 0.001). Conclusion CFD and rhinomanometry are moderately correlated, but CFD underpredicts nasal resistance measured in vivo due in part to the assumption of rigid nasal walls. Our results confirm previous reports that subjective nasal patency correlates better with unilateral than with bilateral measurements and in the context of an intervention.

N2 - The versatility and application of Intelligent Multi-Agent Systems (I-MASs) is becoming more complex. The increase in complexity is due to a sudden requirement for Intelligent Agents (IAs) and I-MASs to exhibit more human-like functionality. This includes the ability to represent knowledge using perception, learning, recognition, reasoning and rationality. In addition, this ``wishlist’’ of functionality also needs to be constrained within the limits of current technology. Designers of I-MASs are looking at mechanisms and processes that can satisfy more involved requirements. Two such paradigms are cognitive architectures and computational intelligence. The Agent Coordination and Cooperation Cognitive Model (AC3M) was developed to primarily illustrate the link between agent coordination and cooperation. Whilst analysing AC3M, the Stimulate-Orient-Decide-Act (SODA) methodology was discovered. This methodology is a result of integrating cognitive architecture principles with computational intelligence. SODA was the integration of the Belief, Desire and Intention (BDI) methodology with the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) loop and results in the components of BDI being linked to phases of the OODA loop. The main advantage of the SODA methodology is the enhancement of an agent’s situational awareness, which has proven to be paramount in the area of team automation.

N2 - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most important diagnostic tools in modern medicine. Since it is a high-cost and highly-complex imaging modality, computational models are frequently built to enhance its understanding as well as to support further development. However, such models often have to be simplified to complete simulations in a reasonable time. Thus, the simulations with high spatial/temporal resolutions, with any motion consideration (like blood flow) and/or with 3D objects usually call for using parallel computing environments. In this paper, we propose to use graphics processing units (GPUs) for fast simulations of MRI of vascular structures. We apply a CUDA environment which supports general purpose computation on GPU (GPGPU). The data decomposition strategy is applied and thus the parts of each virtual object are spread over the GPU cores. The GPU cores are responsible for calculating the influence of blood flow behavior and MRI events after successive time steps. In the proposed approach, different data layouts, memory access patterns, and other memory improvements are applied to efficiently exploit GPU resources. Computational performance is thoroughly validated for various vascular structures and different NVIDIA GPUs. Results show that MRI simulations can be accelerated significantly thanks to GPGPU. The proposed GPU-based approach may be easily adopted in the modeling of other flow related phenomena like perfusion, diffusion or transport of contrast agents.

N2 - The concept of ‘digital phenotyping’ was originally developed by researchers in the mental health field, but it has travelled to other disciplines and areas. This commentary draws upon our experiences of working in two scientific projects that are based at the University of Oxford’s Big Data Institute – The RADAR-AD project and The Minerva Initiative – which are developing algorithmic phenotyping technologies. We describe and analyse the concepts of digital biomarkers and computational phenotyping that underlie these projects, explain how they are linked to other research in digital phenotyping and compare and contrast some of their epistemological and ethical implications. In particular, we argue that the phenotyping paradigm in both projects is grounded on an assumption of ‘objectivity’ that is articulated in different ways depending on the role that is given to the computational/digital tools. Using the concept of ‘affordance’, we show how specific functionalities relate to potential uses and social implications of these technologies and argue that it is important to distinguish among them as the concept of digital phenotyping is increasingly being used with a variety of meanings.

N2 - To encourage the use of computational modeling in organizational behavior research, an example computational model is developed and rigorous tests of it presented. Specifically, a computational model based on control theory was created to test the theory’s explanation of the goal-level effect (e.g., higher goals lead to higher performance). Data from simulations of the model were compared with the behavior of 32 undergraduate students performing a scheduling task under various within-subject manipulations and across time. Correlational analyses indicated that the model accounted for most of the participants’data, with coefficients between the model and each participant’s behavior mostly in the high 90s.

N2 - Most manganese used in the world is consumed as ferroalloys by the steelmaking industry. Submerged arc electric furnace smelting using the manganese-rich slag method is widely used to produce ferromanganese. This process has been modelled using the HSC computational thermodynamics package. It was assumed that higher manganese and iron oxides are reduced to MnO and FeO before entering the zone where molten slag and alloy form and equilibrate. The model predictions were compared to data from Thermit Alloys (P) Limited, an Indian ferroalloy smelter, and the agreement was found to be good. It was then used to examine the affects of changing the amount of carbon reductant and temperature on several performance indicators. The results of this modelling are discussed and it is concluded that the model is useful as an aid to understanding ferromanganese smelting.

N2 - This paper reports our research concerning dialogue strategies suitable for adoption by a human–computer debating system. We propose a set of strategic heuristics for a computer to adopt to enable it to function as a dialogue participant. In particular, we consider means of assessing the proposed strategy. A system involving two agents in dialogue with each other and a human–agent debate system are constructed and subsequently used to facilitate the evaluations. The evaluations suggest that the proposed strategy can enable the computer to act as an effective dialogue participant. It is anticipated that this work will contribute towards the development of computerised dialogue systems and help to illuminate research issues concerning strategies in dialectical systems.

N2 - Abstract A computational investigation of the interaction of the vectored primary jet from the main engine with the subsonic flow around a tailless unmanned air vehicle (UAV) configuration, with a cropped diamond wing planform, has been carried out. An initial study has been completed using Reynolds-averaged Navier—Stokes methods in conjunction with the shear-stress transport k—ω model. Various sets of simulations were performed on the basis of quantifying the thrust vectoring (TV) jet entrainment effects by means of aerodynamic forces and moments when key factors are combined, such as angles of thrust velocity deflection at different jet Mach number and angles of attack. It was found that reaction forces induced by the modified pressure on the integrated boundary of the body results in an enhancement of the TV effectiveness in producing the forces and moments required for the flight vehicle trim and manoeuvring. Those reaction forces were found to be independent of the angle of attack.

N2 - A combined experimental-computational approach is used for the analysis of hygrothermal performance of a brick wall provided with interior thermal insulation system. A 2D laboratory experiment is performed to determine temperature and moisture fields in a characteristic segment of the envelope over a sufficiently long period including cold winter months. Then, a computational model of moisture and heat transport is developed, using an integral two-phase balance equation capable of distinguishing between the particular phases of water and an enthalpy-based heat balance equation. A 2D computational representation of the experiment is used for model calibration and identification of unknown parameters, resulting in a very good agreement of experimental and calculated fields, with R2 between 0.9687 and 0.9888. The calibrated model is subsequently used for a long-term hygrothermal assessment of the studied detail to demonstrate the functionality of the interior thermal insulation system, as well as the applicability of the developed model.

N2 - Introduction A radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the best choice for achieving vascular access (VA) for hemodialysis, but this AVF has high rates of early failure due to juxta-anastomotic stenosis, making it impossible to use for dialysis. Low hemodynamic shear stress contributes to the pathophysiology of VA failure due to secondary thrombosis, stenosis, and re-occlusion after percutaneous intervention. Methods We used a computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) approach to evaluate the shear stress distribution and minimize its effects under various conditions including changes in the anastomosis angle. A three-dimensional computational domain was designed for arteriovenous end-to-side anastomosis based on anastomosis angles of 45°, 90° and including 135° angle of an obtuse anastomosis using three-dimensional design software. COMSOL Multiphysics® simulation software was used to identify the hemodynamic factors influencing wall shear stress at the anastomosis site using a low Reynolds number k-ε turbulence model that included non-Newtonian blood flow characteristics, the complete cardiac pulse cycle, and distention of blood vessels. In preliminary clinical study, all 201 patients who received a radiocephalic wrist AVF from January 2009 to February 2014 were divided into classic and obtuse angle groups. Results The CFD results showed that the largest anastomosis angle (135°) resulted in lower shear stress, which would help reduce AVF failures. This obtuse angle was preferred, as it minimized the development of anastomotic stenosis and tended to favor primary and primary-assisted patency in clinical study. Conclusions An obtuse radiocephalic wrist AVF shows more favorable patency compared to a classic radiocephalic AVF. Surgeons establishing a radiocephalic wrist AVF would be better to consider an AVF with an obtuse anastomosis.

N2 - There has been a continued expansion of the uses of computer-based tools and techniques in public sector endeavors: from traditional notions of data collection and management (bean counting) to the processing of data into information that supports managerial activities. Advances in technology based on emerging work in decision theory, information science, and cognitive science will allow for use of these computational models in more expansive “advisory” roles to decision makers of all types. To what degree can public sector decision makers use computational models to support or advise decision making? As these new technologies become a routine part of the policy process, will a belief in computer omnipotence tempt public sector decision makers to abdicate personal responsibility for poor choices? The authors explore the choice-related implications associated with the increased use of computer-based models, define possible computer-based decision support models (CBDSMs), and present a typology of credible uses of CBDSMs.

N2 - Any hydraulic reaction turbine is installed with a draft tube that impacts widely the entire turbine performance, on which its functions are as follows: drive the flux in appropriate manner after it releases its energy to the runner; recover the suction head by a suction effect; and improve the dynamic energy in the runner outlet. All these functions are strongly linked to the geometric definition of the draft tube. This article proposes a geometric parametrization and analysis of a Francis turbine draft tube. Based on the parametric definition, geometric changes in the draft tube are proposed and the turbine performance is modeled by computational fluid dynamics; the boundary conditions are set by measurements performed in a hydroelectric power plant. This modeling allows us to see the influence of the draft tube shape on the entire turbine performance. The numerical analysis is based on the steady-state solution of the turbine component flows for different guide vanes opening and multiple modified draft tubes. The computational fluid dynamics predictions are validated using hydroelectric plant measurements. The prediction of the turbine performance is successful and it is linked to the draft tube geometric features; therefore, it is possible to obtain a draft tube parameter value that results in a desired turbine performance.

N2 - Objective This study develops a computational model to predict drivers’ response time and understand the underlying cognitive mechanism for freeway exiting takeovers in conditionally automated vehicles (AVs). Background Previous research has modeled drivers’ takeover response time in emergency scenarios that demand a quick response. However, existing models may not be applicable for scheduled, non-time-critical takeovers as drivers take longer to resume control when there is no time pressure. A model of driver response time in non-time-critical takeovers is lacking. Method A computational cognitive model of driver takeover response time is developed based on Queuing Network-Model Human Processor (QN-MHP) architecture. The model quantifies gaze redirection in response to takeover request (ToR), task prioritization, driver situation awareness, and driver trust to address the complexities of drivers’ takeover strategies when sufficient time budget exists. Results Experimental data of a preliminary driving simulator study were used to validate the model. The model accounted for 97% of the experimental takeover response time for freeway exiting. Conclusion The current model can successfully predict drivers’ response time for scheduled, non-time-critical freeway exiting takeovers in conditionally AVs. Application This model can be applied to the human-machine interface design with respect to ToR lead time for enhancing safe freeway exiting takeovers in conditionally AVs. It also provides a foundation for future modeling work towards an integrated driver model of freeway exiting takeover performance.

N2 - Hydrodynamic effects of mussel farms have attracted increased research attentions in recent years. The understanding of the hydrodynamic impacts is essential for predicting the sustainability of mussel farms. A large mussel farm includes thousands of mussel droppers, and the combined drag on the mussel droppers is sufficient to possibly affect the longevity of the entire long-lines. This article intends to study the drag and wake of an individual long-line mussel dropper using computational fluid dynamics approaches. Two equivalent rough cylinders, namely, Curved-Model and Sharp-Model, have been utilized to simulate the mussel dropper, and each rough cylinder is assigned with surface roughness. The porosity is not considered in this article due to its complexity from inhalant and exhalant of mussels. Two-dimensional laminar simulations are conducted at Reynolds number from 10 to 200, and three-dimensional large eddy simulations are conducted at subcritical Reynolds number ranging from 3900 to . The results show that larger drag coefficients and Strouhal numbers are attributed to surface roughness and sharp crowns on the rough cylinder. The obtained drag coefficient ranges from 1.1 to 1.2 with respect to the diameter of the mussel dropper and the peak value of the tidal velocities. Wakes behind rough cylinders fluctuate more actively compared to those of smooth cylinders. This research work provides new insight for further investigations on hydrodynamic interactions between fluid and mussel droppers.

N2 - The primary objective of this investigation is to develop efficient and robust computational schemes for a damage-coupled cyclic thermoviscoplasticity model for solder materials. Three constitutive integration algorithms, Euler, modified Euler, and semi-implicit algorithm for the model are examined. The three algorithms for the model are coded in the commercial finite element (FE) code ABAQUS (version 6.21) via its user-defined material subroutine UMAT. Two single-step algorithms of the substep scheme are applied for the modified Euler algorithm to control the error in the integration of constitutive laws. A semi-empirical formulation is established for an adaptive time stepping algorithm that is based on the Euler algorithm. The simulations of single-element, miniature specimen and notched specimen simulations have been conducted and compared with the test results under monotonic tensile, creep, and fatigue tests of 63Sn-37Pb solder. It is observed that the explicit algorithm consistently requires much less CPU time than others. The modified Euler algorithm has shown, on the other hand, to be not only efficient but also accurate. The semi-implicit algorithm yields an accurate solution. It is worth noting that the method is also effective by applying an appropriate integration scheme.

N2 - As schools and districts across the United States adopt computer science standards and curriculum for K-12 computer science education, they look to integrate the foundational concepts of computational thinking (CT) into existing core subjects of elementary-age students. Research has shown the effectiveness of teaching CT elements (abstraction, generalization, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, debugging) using non-programming, unplugged approaches. These approaches address common barriers teachers face with lack of knowledge, familiarity, or technology tools. Picture books and graphic novels present an unexplored non-programming, unplugged resource for teachers to integrate computational thinking into their CT or CT-integrated lessons. This analysis examines 27 picture books and graphic novels published between 2015 and 2020 targeted to K-6 students for representation of computational thinking elements. Using the computational thinking curriculum framework for K-6, we identify the grade-level competencies of the CT elements featured in the books compared to the books’ target age groups. We compare grade-level competencies to interest level to identify each CT element representation as “foundational,” “on-target,” or “advanced.” We conclude that literature offers teachers a non-programming unplugged resource to expose students to CT and enhance CT and CT-integrated lessons, while also personalizing learning based on CT readiness and interest level.

N2 - Computational thinking (CT) has emerged as an important method in the United States for helping children learn to solve complex problems and develop skills necessary for coding and other computer science-related endeavors. Research has revealed that CT can be encouraged with children as young as 3–4 years of age. While some preschools and schools are incorporating CT into their curriculum for young children, ages 0–8 years, it is important to understand how environments outside of schools are using CT with young children, particularly given that, in the United States, a large percent of young children, ages 0–5 years, are not in formal school settings. This study provides insight into this area through 20 interviews with educators in libraries and museums to understand how they incorporate CT into their work with young children, ages 0–8 years, and their families. The interviews reveal that library and museum educators are using a variety of developmentally-appropriate approaches, such as play, experimentation, and narrative, to design and offer a diverse array of engaging, hands-on CT activities that allow young children to practice CT in child-centered, meaningful ways.

N2 - Computational thinking (CT) has gained considerable attention and in-depth discussion over the last two decades. Although the significance of CT has been highlighted, it could be challenging for educators to teach CT. Fortunately, adopting robots in education has been evidenced to be of benefit to promoting students’ learning motivation, CT, and higher-order thinking skills. However, several significant factors affecting students’ programming performances in robot-assisted learning activities have been identified, such as cognitive needs and organization. In this study, a CMR-BBP (concept map robot block-based programming) approach was designed by integrating concept maps into robot block-based programming to enhance students’ programming learning. Moreover, a three-group experiment was carried out in an elementary school to evaluate their learning outcomes. The experimental results revealed that the CMR-BBP approach benefited the students’ perceptions of their computational thinking and problem solving in comparison with the R-BBP (robot block-based programming) and C-BBP (conventional block-based programming) approaches. Furthermore, regarding cognitive load, both the CMR-BBP and R-BBP approaches enhanced the students’ germane cognitive load, while the CMR-BBP approach effectively reduced their extrinsic cognitive load. This study could be a notable reference for designing other courses in conjunction with programming learning activities.

N2 - Although abstraction is widely understood to be one of the primary components of computational thinking, the roots of abstraction may be traced back to different fields. Hence, the meaning of abstraction in the context of computational thinking is often confounded, as researchers interpret abstraction through diverse lenses. To disentangle these conceptual threads and gain insight into the operationalisation of abstraction, a systematic review of 96 empirical studies was undertaken. Analysis revealed that identifying features of entities, extracting relevant features, discovering patterns, creating rules and assembling the parts together were the core actions of abstraction. With the primary aim of simplifying practical procedures, abstraction was operationalised as the sophistication of a program, the matching of patterns, the creation of alternative representations, the transfer of solutions, the measurement of a learner’s activity and reading program codes. There is an obvious need for researchers to align the conceptual meanings they have established of abstraction with the practical facts of operationalisation. The need to empirically validate emerging models and the implications for future research are discussed.

N2 - The paper-and-pencil programming strategy (PPS) is a way of representing an idea logically by any representation that can be created using paper and pencil. It was developed for non-computer majors to improve their understanding and use of computational thinking and increase interest in learning computer science. A total of 110 non-majors in their sophomore year were assigned to either a Logo or a PPS course with attendance being 2 hours per week for 15 weeks. To measure the effectiveness of PPS, the Group Assessment of Logical Thinking and a self-assessment survey pre- and post-test were used. Findings indicated that PPS not only improved students’ overall logical thinking as much as did Logo programming learning, but also increased scores on one more subscale of logical thinking than did the Logo course. In addition, PPS significantly helped students understand the concept of computational thinking and increased their interest in learning computer science.

N2 - Educational technologists and practitioners have made substantial strides in developing affordable digital and tangible resources to support both formal and informal computer science instruction. However, there is a lack of research on practice-based assignments, such as Internet of Things (IoT) projects, that allow undergraduate students to design and demonstrate educational robots using digital or physical assistance, especially when it comes to computational thinking (CT) and programming skills development in association with their psycho-emotional experience. This study compares the impact of Scratch and LEGO® WeDo robotic kits on students’ CT and programming skills development. A quasi-experimental approach was conducted, involving two hundred forty-six participants (n = 246), who were equally divided between Scratch and LEGO® WeDo groups. Results indicate that the LEGO® WeDo group showed greater improvement in CT and programming skills development, while designing and presenting IoT projects. Nevertheless, no significant association between motivation, grit, and CT skills was observed. The findings highlight the potential of tangible robotics in facilitating students’ hands-on learning and enhancing motivation to foster CT and programming skills. This study provides a wide range of implications for instructional designers on how to use tangible robotics to support hands-on IoT projects in computer science courses.

N2 - This study examines the current state of assessment of computational thinking (CT) programming in public libraries in the United States. In particular, this study identifies the assessment tools and strategies that public library staff use to evaluate the success of CT youth programming, as well as how they share these assessment results, what they share, and with whom. This work also examines the perceptions of library staff on assessment of CT learning in libraries. Through our work, we highlight the need for a change of mindset in the perception of library staff toward assessment of CT learning in libraries. We also demonstrate the need for suitable assessment strategies to measure learning in CT programming in libraries beyond attendance and retention, that communicate to library staff on how they can revise their programs and to share their program impact with library stakeholders who make decisions on budget and resource allocations.

N2 - Computer science and computational thinking (CT) education in K-12 schools have been escalating in recent years. A couple of CT instructional models have been proposed to depict the roles of CT in K-16 education. Yet, neither of them discussed CT infusion into a subject course. In this article, we proposed a CT-integration model called TPC2T. In this model, we suggested considering CT as a second subject and using an appropriate technological pedagogical approach to make students’ learning of two subjects meaningful and engaging. We implemented this model in a CT-integrated lesson in two sections of a high-school Spanish course. Students worked in small groups and coded three small and one comprehensive digital Spanish-culture stories in Scratch. Results showed that students taking the CT-integrated lesson had the same degree of improvement in their Spanish culture knowledge as their peers who did not take the CT-integrated lesson. Besides, students taking the CT-integrated lesson had a significant improvement in their CT knowledge. At the same time, their CT self-efficacy outperformed those who did not take the CT-integrated lesson. We discussed the results and offered suggestions for researchers and educators at the end of the article.

N2 - Computational thinking (CT), an essential competency for comprehending and addressing intricate issues in the digital world, has been incorporated into curriculum planning as a goal for programming education. This study introduced flow design into programming curricula to investigate its impact on undergraduates ’CT skills during pair work. Two types of flow design approaches, construct-by-self flow design (CBS-FD) and construct-on-scaffold flow design (COS-FD), were proposed to determine which approach better enhances students’ CT skills. Seventy-six first-year undergraduates participated, including thirty in the CBS group and thirty-six in the COS group. Evaluations made from the results and processes of programming tasks were employed to describe computational performance and computational practices, respectively. Data gathered from CT skill surveys were thoroughly analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of computational perspectives. Our findings highlighted that COS-FD significantly improved participants’ computational performance compared with CBS-FD. The COS groups fostered an engaging, sharing atmosphere, while CBS groups spent more energy on negotiating the manipulation of flow design. Moreover, both COS-FD and CBS-FD proved beneficial in enhancing participants’ computational perspectives, with the COS groups better improving their algorithm thinking. The study presents valuable perspectives on the design and implementation of collaborative programming activities within curriculum education.

N2 - The increasing availability of data, along with sophisticated computational methods for analyzing them, presents researchers with new opportunities and challenges. In this article, we address both by describing computational and network methods that can be used to identify cases of rare phenomena. We evaluate each method’s relative utility in the identification of a specific rare phenomenon of interest to social movement researchers: the spillover of social movement claims from one movement to another. We identify and test five different approaches to detecting cases of spillover in the largest data set of protest events currently available, finding that an ensemble approach that combines clique and correspondence analysis and an ensemble approach combining all methods perform considerably better than others. Our approach is preferable to other ways of analyzing such cases; compared to qualitative approaches, our computational process identifies many more cases of spillover—some of which are surprising and would likely not be otherwise investigated. At the same time, compared to crude quantitative measures, our approach substantially reduces the “noise,” or identification of false-positive cases, of movement spillover. We argue that this technique, which can be adapted to other research topics, is a good illustration of how the thoughtful implementation of computational methods can allow for the efficient identification of rare events and also bridge deductive and inductive approaches to scientific inquiry.

It asserts that every finitely generated projective A-module is free. We construct a symbolic algorithm that computes the basis of a given finitely generated projective A-module. The algorithm is implemented in a computational package. Its efficiency is illustrated by four representative examples.

N2 - Knowledge and skill in multiplication were investigated for late elementary-grade students with mathematics learning disabilities (MLD), typically achieving age-matched peers, low-achieving age-matched peers, and ability-matched peers by examining multiple measures of computational skill, working memory, and conceptual knowledge. Poor multiplication fact mastery and calculation fluency and general working memory discriminated children with MLD from typically achieving age-matched peers. Furthermore, children with MLD were slower in executing backup procedures than typically achieving age-matched peers. The performance of children with MLD on multiple measures of multiplication skill and knowledge was most similar to that of ability-matched younger children. MLD may be due to difficulties in computational skills and working memory. Implications for the diagnosis and remediation of MLD are discussed.

N2 - We present an implementation of DIANA, a computational model of spoken word recognition, to model responses collected in the Massive Auditory Lexical Decision (MALD) project. DIANA is an end-to-end model, including an activation and decision component that takes the acoustic signal as input, activates internal word representations, and outputs lexicality judgments and estimated response latencies. Simulation 1 presents the process of creating acoustic models required by DIANA to analyze novel speech input. Simulation 2 investigates DIANA’s performance in determining whether the input signal is a word present in the lexicon or a pseudoword. In Simulation 3, we generate estimates of response latency and correlate them with general tendencies in participant responses in MALD data. We find that DIANA performs fairly well in free word recognition and lexical decision. However, the current approach for estimating response latency provides estimates opposite to those found in behavioral data. We discuss these findings and offer suggestions as to what a contemporary model of spoken word recognition should be able to do.

N2 - The current criterion for surgical intervention in abdominal aortic aneurysms, based upon a maximal aortic diameter, is considered conservative due to the high mortality rate in case of rupture. The research community is actively investigating the use of computational mechanics tools combined with patient-specific imaging to help identify more accurate criteria. Widespread uptake of a successful metric will however be limited by the need for computed tomography, which is at present the primary image extraction method on account of the location and complex shape of the aneurysms. The use of three-dimensional ultrasound as the scanning method is more attractive on account of increased availability, reduced cost and reduced risk to patients. The suitability of three-dimensional ultrasound is assessed for this purpose in the present work; computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed on geometries obtained from the same patient using both ultrasound and computed tomography. The influence of different smoothing algorithms is investigated in the geometry preparation stage and Taubin’s low-pass filter was found to best preserve geometry features. Laminar, Newtonian, steady-state simulation analysis identified haemodynamic characteristics to be qualitatively similar in terms of wall shear stress, velocity and vorticity. The study demonstrates the potential for three-dimensional ultrasound to be integrated into a more accessible patient-specific modelling tool able to identify the need for surgical intervention of abdominal aortic aneurysms.

N2 - The information processing approach traditionally has been the theoretical foundation of mental workload. Computational neurocognitive models are emerging approaches to understanding how the brain performs cognitive functions. Computational complexity refers to the many possibilities and ambiguities intrinsic in the environmental stimuli. These models agree that the brain has limited computational power. Utility and implications of the computational approaches to the understanding of mental workload, especially that of higher-level activities such as strategic control of dynamic multiple-task performance and situation awareness will be explored.

N2 - BACKGROUND: Systemic-to-pulmonary shunt is a palliative procedure used to decrease pulmonary blood flow in congenital heart diseases. Shunt stenosis or occlusion has been reported to be associated with mortality; therefore, the management of thrombotic complications remains a challenge for most congenital cardiovascular surgeons. Despite its importance, the optimal method for shunt anastomosis remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The study investigates the clinical benefits of the punch-out technique over conventional methods in the anastomosis process of Systemic-to-pulmonary shunt, focusing on its potential to reduce shunt-related complications. METHODS: Anastomotic models were created by two different surgeons employing both traditional slit and innovative punch-out techniques. Computational tomography was performed to construct three-dimensional models for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. We assessed the flow pattern, helicity, magnitude of wall shear stress, and its gradient. RESULTS: The anastomotic flow area was larger in the model using the punch-out technique than in the slit model. In CFD simulation, we found that using the punch-out technique decreases the likelihood of establishing a high wall shear stress distribution around the anastomosis line in the model. CONCLUSION: The punch-out technique emerges as a promising method in SPS anastomosis, offering a reproducible and less skill-dependent alternative that potentially diminishes the risk of shunt occlusion, thereby enhancing patient outcomes.

N2 - In this work, experimental and theoretical analyses of the power losses in an industrial planetary speed reducer were performed in order to define the weight of the different types of power losses in the global efficiency as well as to understand the appropriateness and the effectiveness of the models and tools available in the literature for the prediction of these power losses. From this investigation, it has emerged that even if for all the kinds of power losses improvements are in principle possible, those for which, at the same time, more improvements seem possible and effective models are lacking are the load-independent power losses. For this reason, a computational fluid dynamics methodology able to evaluate load-independent gear power losses in planetary gearboxes is proposed. The other types of power losses were determined by means of analytical models available in the literature and, together with the calculated load-independent gear power losses, compared with the experimentally determined power losses showing the effectiveness of the adopted calculation models.

N2 - A numerical model based on computational fluid dynamics is developed to analyze fluid flow and thermal aspects in grinding. The model uses multiphase fluid flow with heat transfer based on the volume-of-fluid method, convection, conduction in solids and a multiple reference frame model of the porous grinding zone. Fluid velocity vectors, useful flow rate, grinding temperatures and energy partition are predicted using the model. In lieu of direct measurements of these quantities, the verification relies on the indirect assessment of surface integrity. The simulation results provide adequate agreement with the measured residual stress, depth of heat-affected zone and full width at half maximum profile with respect to the grinding temperatures.

N2 - Computational design of small molecule putative inhibitors of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is presented. Plk1, which regulates the cell cycle, is often over expressed in cancers. Down regulation of Plk1 has been shown to inhibit tumor progression. Most kinase inhibitors interact with the ATP binding site on Plk1, which is highly conserved. This makes the development of Plk1-specific inhibitors challenging, since different kinases have similar ATP sites. However, Plk1 also contains a unique region called the polo-box domain (PBD), which is absent from other kinases. In this study, the PBD site was used as a target for designed Plk1 putative inhibitors. Common structural features of several experimentally known Plk1 ligands were first identified. The findings were used to design small molecules that specifically bonded Plk1. Drug likeness and possible toxicities of the molecules were investigated. Molecules with no implied toxicities and optimal drug likeness values were used for docking studies. Several molecules were identified that made stable complexes only with Plk1 and LYN kinases, but not with other kinases. One molecule was found to bind exclusively the PBD site of Plk1. Possible utilization of the designed molecules in drugs against cancers with over expressed Plk1 is discussed.

N2 - Recital 33 GDPR has often been interpreted as referring to ‘broad consent’. This version of informed consent was intended to allow data subjects to provide their consent for certain areas of research, or parts of research projects, conditional to the research being in line with ‘recognised ethical standards’. In this article, we argue that broad consent is applicable in the emerging field of Computational Social Science (CSS), which lies at the intersection of data science and social science. However, the lack of recognised ethical standards specific to CSS poses a practical barrier to the use of broad consent in this field and other fields that lack recognised ethical standards. Upon examining existing research ethics standards in social science and data science, we argue that they are insufficient for CSS. We further contend that the fragmentation of European Union (EU) law and research ethics sources makes it challenging to establish universally recognised ethical standards for scientific research. As a result, CSS researchers and other researchers in emerging fields that lack recognised ethical standards are left without sufficient guidance on the use of broad consent as provided for in the GDPR. We conclude that responsible EU bodies should provide additional guidance to facilitate the use of broad consent in CSS research.

N2 - With the current shift of increasing the computational power of a processor by including multiple cores instead of increasing the clock frequency, consideration of computational efficiency is gaining increased importance for computational fluid dynamics codes. This is especially critical for applications that require high throughput. For example, applying computational fluid dynamics simulations to multi-disciplinary design optimization requires a large number of similar simulations with different input parameters. Therefore, a reduction in the runtime of the code can lead to large reduction in the design process. In our case study, a two-dimensional, block-structured computational fluid dynamics code was optimized for performance on machines with hierarchical memory systems. This paper illustrates the techniques applied to transform an initial version of the code to an optimized version that yielded performance improvements of 10% for very small cases to about 50% for large test cases that did not fit into the cache memory of the target processor. A detailed performance analysis of the code starting at the global level down to subroutines and data structures is presented in this paper. The performance improvements can be explained through a reduction of cache misses in all levels of the memory hierarchy. The L1 cache misses were reduced by about 50%, the L2 cache misses by about 80% and the translation lookaside buffer misses by about 90% for the optimized version of the code. The code performance was also evaluated for multi-core processors, where efficiency is especially important when several instances of an application are running simultaneously. In this case, the most optimized version, a blocked version of the optimized code, more effectively maintained efficiency as more cores were activated compared to the unblocked version. This illustrates that optimizing cache performance may be increasingly important as the number of cores per processor continues to rise.

N2 - Today’s world allows people to connect over larger distances and in shorter intervals than ever before, widely monitored by massive online data sources. Ongoing worldwide computerization has led to completely new opportunities for social scientists to conceive human interactions and relations in unknown precision and quantities. However, the large data sets require techniques that are more likely to be found in computer and natural sciences than in the established fields of social relations. In order to facilitate the participation of social scientists in an emerging interdisciplinary research branch of “computational social science,” we propose in this article the usage of the Python programming language. First, we carve out its capacity to handle “Big Data” in suitable formats. Second, we introduce programming libraries to analyze large networks and big text corpora, conduct simulations, and compare their performance to their counterparts in the R environment. Furthermore, we highlight practical tools implemented in Python for operational tasks like preparing presentations. Finally, we discuss how the process of writing code may help to exemplify theoretical concepts and could lead to empirical applications that gain a better understanding of the social processes initiated by the truly global connections of the Internet era.

N2 - This paper is an introduction to the computational complexity theory. I believe that the standard courses in complexity theory make some things much more important than they really are, while things which I find extremely interesting are marginalized. Thus, it can be seen as my subjective view on what is important and interesting in computational complexity, and what is not. We state the basic facts from computational complexity theory using the blackboard computations (one-dimensional cellular automata) as the standard computation model; we argue the benefits of such approach. This article is somewhat based on my series of talks from Warsztaty Logiczne 2014 in Białka Tatrzańska, although these talks covered more topics, such as NL=coNL, and links between BPP and the polynomial hierarchy.

N2 - Presentation of data is a major component to academic research. However, programming languages, computational tools, and methods for exploring and analyzing data can be time consuming and frustrating to learn and finding help with these stages of the broader research process can be daunting. In this work, we highlight the impacts that computational research support programs housed in library contexts can have for fulfilling gaps in student, staff, and faculty research needs. The archival history of one such organization, Software and Services for Data Science (SSDS) in the Stanford University Cecil H. Green Library, is used to outline challenges faced by social sciences and humanities researchers from the 1980s to the present day. To compliment this history, participation metrics from consulting services (1999–2021) and workshops (2000–2021) are presented along with updated workshop participant feedback forms (n = 99) and further illustrate the profound impacts that these services can have for helping researchers succeed. Consulting and workshop metrics indicate that SSDS has supported at least 27,031 researchers between 1999 and 2021 (average of more than 1175 per year). A t-test on the feedback form data indicates that participant knowledge in workshops statistically significantly increased more than one scale point from workshop start to completion. Results also indicate that despite our successes, many past challenges continue to present barriers regardless of exponential advances in computing, teaching, and learning—specifically around learning to access data and learning the software and tools to use it. We hope that our story helps other institutions understand how indispensable computational research support is within the library.

N2 - Despite the growing popularity of digital narratives, research on digital storytelling and its spread through social media interactions remains limited. Inspired by the social contagion theory, we introduce the concept of narrative contagion—where a story shared by a person or organization prompts others to share their stories—and investigate its process and outcome in online cancer communities. Utilizing a large dataset of 849 Facebook posts, 47,291 comments, and 14,466 replies, our artificial intelligence (AI)-based computational analysis provides evidence for narrative contagion among individual users in organization-hosted cancer communities on Facebook. It also reveals different organizational message characteristics, such as emotional arousal, post topic, and request for storytelling, that affect user storytelling and emotional support in comments and replies. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of digital storytelling and its collective dynamics in online communities.

Based upon 18 in-depth interviews with data journalism leaders within American newspapers, this study examines how newsrooms are restructuring to accommodate data news work. More specifically, the research identifies four “critical junctures” by which newspapers expand data journalism operations. The interviews establish that expanding a paper’s commitment to data journalism requires reorganizing the newsroom with new layers of structural complexity.

N2 - The prefix meta is popular in psychology as well as in other sciences oriented on the investigation of psychology. In the first case the usage is quite simple: every term is “the sum” of meta and usual psychological concept. In the second case, the situation is much more complicated. Sometimes, it is related to transition on a higher level of abstraction, from first-order to second-order investigations. Why is such a transition necessary and is it useful for scientific progress? The comparative analysis of the meta-approach to different sciences shows both specific peculiarities (reasons for application of the prefix, methods of manipulation and investigation, main objects of analysis, goals raised, and status of metaresearcher) and common features and regularities that may be discovered only in an interdisciplinary context. In this special section, we suggest a new way of application of meta-approach to psychology—in terms of metathinking. Our main idea is as follows: The wide circulation of meta-approach to psychology with necessity leads to serious changes in thinking of both researchers in the field of psychology and in sciences oriented on investigation of psychology.

N2 - The effects of hydrogen addition to internal combustion engines operated by natural gas/methane has been widely demonstrated experimentally in the literature. Already small hydrogen contents in the fuel show promising benefits with respect to increased engine efficiency, lower CO2 emissions, extended lean operating limits and a higher exhaust gas recirculation tolerance while maintaining the knock resistance of methane. In this article, the influence of hydrogen addition to methane on a spark ignited single cylinder engine is investigated. This article proposes a modelling approach to consider hydrogen addition within three-dimensional reactive computational fluid dynamics in order to establish a framework to gain further insights into the involved processes. Experiments have been performed on a single-cylinder spark-ignition engine situated at a test bed and cater as reference data for validating the proposed reactive computational fluid dynamics modelling approach based around the G-Equation combustion model. Within the course of the first part, crucial aspects relevant to the modelling of the mean engine cycle are highlighted. In this article, a simplified early combustion phase model which considers the transition towards a fully developed turbulent flame following ignition is introduced, along with a second submodel considering combined effects of the walls. The sensitivity of the combustion process towards the modelling approach is presented. The submodels were calibrated for a reference operating point, and a sweep in hydrogen content in the fuel as well as stoichiometric and lean operation has been considered. It is shown that the flame speed coefficient A appearing in the used turbulent flame speed closure, weighting the influence of the turbulent fluctuating speed , has to be adjusted for different hydrogen contents. The introduced submodels allowed for significant improvement of the in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate evolution throughout all considered operating conditions.

N2 - Abstract A typical centrifugal impeller characterized by a low flow coefficient and cylindrical blades is redesigned by means of an intelligent automatic search program. The procedure consists of a feasible sequential quadratic programming algorithm (Fletcher, R. Practical Methods of optimization, 2000 (Wiley)) coupled to a lazy learning (LL) interpolator 1 to speed-up the process. The program is able to handle geometric constraints to reduce the computational effort devoted to the analysis of non-physical configurations. The objective function evaluator is an in-house developed structured computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. The LL approx-imator is called each time the stored database can provide a sufficiently accurate performance estimate for a given geometry, thus reducing the effective CFD computations. The impeller is represented by 25 geometric parameters describing the vane in the meridional and s-0 planes, the blade thickness, and the leading edge shape. The optimization is carried out on the impeller design point maximizing the polytropic efficiency with nearly constant flow coefficient and polytropic head. The optimization is accomplished by maintaining unaltered those geometrical parameters which have to be kept fixed in order to make the impeller fit the original stage. The optimization, carried out on a cluster of 16 PCs, is self-learning and leads to a geometry presenting an increased design point efficiency. The program is completely general and can be applied to any component which can be described by a finite number of geometrical parameters and computed by any numerical instrument to provide performance indices. The work presented in this paper was done under the METHOD EC funded project for the implementation of new technologies for optimization of centrifugal compressors.

N2 - Cancer is a complex disease characterized by a wide array of mutually interacting components constituting the tumor microenvironment (connective tissue, vascular system, immune cells), many of which are targeted therapeutically. In particular, immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently become an established part of the treatment of cancer. Despite great promise, only a portion of the patients display durable response. Current research efforts are concentrated on the determination of tumor-specific biomarkers predictive of response, such as tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, and neo-antigen presentation. However, it is clear that several additional characteristics pertaining to the tumor microenvironment play a critical role in the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Here we comment on the computational methods that are used for the analysis of the tumor microenvironment components from transcriptomic data, discuss the critical needs, and foresee potential evolutions in the field.

N2 - Background Septal deviation is an extremely common anatomic variation in healthy adults. However, there are no standard criteria to determine when a deviated septum is clinically relevant. Presently, selection of patients for septoplasty is based on mostly clinical examination, which is prone to observer bias and may lead to unsuccessful treatment. The objective of this article is twofold. First, we investigate whether the location of a septal deviation within the nasal passages affects nasal resistance. Second, we test whether computer simulations are consistent with rhinomanometry studies in predicting that anterior septal deviations increase nasal resistance more than posterior deviations. Methods A three-dimensional computational model of a healthy nose was created from computed tomography scans. Geometry-deforming software was used to produce models with septal deviations. Computational fluid dynamics techniques were used to simulate nasal airflow and compute nasal resistance. Results Our results revealed that the posterior nasal cavity can accommodate significant septal deviations without a substantial increase in airway resistance. In contrast, a deviation in the nasal valve region more than doubled nasal resistance. These findings are in good agreement with the rhinomanometry literature and with the observation that patients with anterior septal deviations benefit the most from septoplasty. Conclusions In the model, anterior septal deviations increased nasal resistance more than posterior deviations. This suggests, in agreement with the literature, that other causes of nasal obstruction (dysfunction of the nasal valve, allergy, etc.) should be carefully considered in patients with posterior septal deviations because such deviations may not affect nasal resistance. This study illustrates how computational modeling and virtual manipulation of the nasal geometry are useful to investigate nasal physiology.

N2 - Digital technology offers new possibilities for children to play, express themselves, learn, and communicate. A recent development in online practice is a shift toward youth engaged in computer programming online communities. Programming is argued to be the new literacy of the millennium. In this article, I examine the use of Scratch, an online programming community, as a means to support digital literacy for early adolescent gifted, talented, and creative students. In addition, I share the experiences of an early adolescent gifted student with Scratch and consider the use of Scratch to promote interdisciplinary curricular concepts.

N2 - We show that the popular pencil puzzle NURIKABE is intractable from the computational complexity point of view, that is, it is NP-complete, even when the involved numbers are 1 and 2 only. To this end, we show how to simulate Boolean gates by the puzzle under consideration. Moreover, we also study some NURIKABE variants, which remain NP-complete, too.

N2 - This paper describes the use of computational fluid dynamics in teaching graduate students who were in a four‐year B. Tech program. Many of these students did not have a good background in mathematics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and programming; however, most of them were good at computer‐aided design in ProE and were very interested in learning computational fluid dynamics as a design tool in industries. Solidworks flow simulator was chosen as the computational fluid dynamics software to teach students the entire computational fluid dynamics process in a single integrated software environment. Based on projects, computational fluid dynamics numerical methods and fundamentals of heat transfer and fluid flow were introduced to help students understand the computational fluid dynamics process, interpret, and validate simulation results. The computational fluid dynamics simulation of an orifice meter is given as the basic example for the students. Orifice meters are the most common equipment used for measuring fluid flow because of their simple mechanical structure, versatility, and low cost. In this paper, computational fluid dynamics simulation has been used to predict the orifice flow with better accuracy. Computational fluid dynamics simulations have been performed using solidworks flow simulator and validated with the data available in published literature. A new system has been proposed to accurately measure the flow using orifice metering systems.

N2 - This study investigates pronoun interpretation by second language (L2) learners of English, focusing on whether first language (L1) transfer and/or processing difficulty affect L2 learners’ pronoun resolution. It is hypothesized that L2 learners’ non-target performance in L2-pronoun interpretation is attributable to two sources. The first is the computational complexity required for pronoun resolution, as argued in L1 acquisition by Grodzinsky and Reinhart and L2 acquisition by Slabakova et al. The second is how pronoun interpretation operates in L1. The hypothesis is tested by comparing Korean and Spanish L2-English learners’ interpretation of English pronouns using a Truth Value Judgment Task. Both groups had difficulty rejecting pronouns with local-referential antecedents when their proficiency levels were low. Additionally, Korean speakers showed more non-target responses than Spanish speakers due to their knowledge of pronoun interpretation in Korean. These results indicate that both L1 transfer and processing difficulty may be sources of L2 learners’ non-target pronoun interpretation, supporting the hypothesis of the study.

N2 - This article aims to present a two-dimensional parametric analysis of a modified Savonius wind turbine using computational fluid dynamics. The effects of three independent parameters of the rotor, namely, shape factor, overlap ratio, and tip speed ratio on turbine performance were studied and then optimized for maximum coefficient of performance using response surface methodology. The rotor performance was analyzed over specific domains of the parameters under study, and three-variable Box-Behnken design was used for design of experiment. The specific parametric combinations as per design of experiment were simulated using ANSYS Fluent®, and the response variable, coefficient of performance (Cp), was calculated. The sliding mesh model was utilized, and the flow was simulated using Shear Stress Transport (SST) k − ω model. The model was validated using past experimental results and found to predict parametric effects accurately. Minitab® and ReliaSoft DOE++® were used to develop regression equation and find the optimum combination of parameters for coefficient of performance over the specified parametric domains using response surface methodology.

N2 - Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is an indispensable simulation tool for predicting the emission of pollutants in the work environment. Welding is one of the most common industrial processes that might expose the operators and surrounding workers to certain hazardous gaseous metal fumes. In the present study, we used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology for simulating the emission of iron fumes from the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) procedure. A galvanized steel chamber was fabricated to measure the pollutant concentration and identify the size of the fume created by the SMAW. Then, the emission of welding aerosol was simulated using a method of computational fluid-particle dynamics with the ANSYS 2020 R1 software. The highest amount of welding fumes concentration was related to iron fumes (i.e., 3045 μg/m3 with a diameter of 0.25 μm). The results of the current study indicated that the local exhaust and general ventilation system can prevent the spreading of welding fumes to the welder’s breathing zone and the surrounding environment. CFD was also found to be an efficient method for predicting the emission of the iron fumes created by SMAW as well as for selecting an appropriate ventilation system. However, further studies that take the modeling of welding-generated emission of additional metal particles and gases into account will need to be undertaken.

N2 - Constructionism is at once a learning epistemology, a theory of learning, and a pedagogical approach that literally places education in the hands of learners. Constructionism situates students and mentors together in student-directed, project-oriented environments, often enabled with state-of-the-art computational technologies, to foster playful exploration and experimentation. Over time, shared learning experiences in constructionist environments may lead to the formation of learning cultures. To orient the design of constructionist environments for designers of engineering design education, this paper provides a historical context for Seymour Papert’s development of constructionism and distinguishes it from Jean Piaget’s philosophy of constructivism. Constructionism is introduced as an effort targeted at the reform of traditional education. Examples of constructionist environments for learning are then provided. The applicability of constructionism for the design of learning environments for engineering design is also discussed and observations are given for designing the tools, strategies, and activities that comprise constructionist learning environments for engineering design education.

N2 - We present results obtained with new instrumental methods for the acoustic analysis of prosody to evaluate prosody production by children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Typical Development (TD). Two tasks elicit focal stress — one in a vocal imitation paradigm, the other in a picture-description paradigm; a third task also uses a vocal imitation paradigm, and requires repeating stress patterns of two-syllable nonsense words. The instrumental methods differentiated significantly between the ASD and TD groups in all but the focal stress imitation task. The methods also showed smaller differences in the two vocal imitation tasks than in the picture-description task, as was predicted. In fact, in the nonsense word stress repetition task, the instrumental methods showed better performance for the ASD group. The methods also revealed that the acoustic features that predict auditory-perceptual judgment are not the same as those that differentiate between groups. Specifically, a key difference between the groups appears to be a difference in the balance between the various prosodic cues, such as pitch, amplitude, and duration, and not necessarily a difference in the strength or clarity with which prosodic contrasts are expressed.

N2 - The current study aims to determine the effect of teaching a mechanic neuro-computerized course through virtual learning environments (VLE) to develop computational thinking among mathematics pre-service teachers. The neuro-computerized virtual learning environments (NCVLE) model was designed to be used to teach the mechanics course to third-year students of the mathematics department. To achieve the targeted learning outcomes, the study recruited (102) third-year students of the Faculty of Education and classified them into a control group of (50) students and an experimental group of (52) students. The experiment lasted for 14 weeks during one semester of the 2021-2022 academic year. The results agreed with most of what has been found from relevant literature and studies. Also, the results indicated that the NCVLE model played a vital role in the purposeful teaching, learning, and assessment processes and enhanced the learning of computational thinking.

N2 - The importance of computational thinking (CT) as a 21st-century skill for future generations has been a key consideration in the reforms of many national and regional educational systems. Much attention has been paid to integrating CT into the traditional subject classrooms. This paper describes a scoping review of learning tools for integrating CT and mathematics in current empirical studies published from 2015 to 2021. The review showed that most of the studies implemented CT-intensive Math-connected integration. Five major types of CT tools had been identified, i.e., digital tangibles, apps and games, programming languages, formative or summative assessments, and other technological tools. In many instances, the tools also provide functions of assessment of CT skills. The most assessed CT competencies were including algorithms and algorithmic thinking, abstraction, testing and debugging, loops, and sequences. Geometry and Measurement was the most assessed mathematics topic. Our scoping review is beneficial in the investigation of the literature on CT and mathematics education, as well as guides those who are interested in developing curriculum, programs, or assessments that involve the integration of CT and mathematics.

N2 - Computational thinking is believed to be beneficial for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) learning as it is closely related to many other skills required by STEM disciplines. There has been an increasing interest in integrating computational thinking into STEM and many studies have been conducted to examine the effects of this intervention. This meta-analysis examined the effects of computational thinking integration in STEM on students’ STEM learning performance in the K-12 education context. Following systematic procedures, we identified 20 publications with 21 studies meeting the inclusion and exclusion criteria from a range of academic databases. We extracted effect sizes on student learning outcomes in one-group pretest-posttest designs. We also examined a range of moderating variables in the models, including student levels, STEM disciplines, intervention durations, alignment with content standards (e.g., CSTA/NGSS), types of intervention (e.g., simulation), and the use of unplugged/plugged activities. Overall, we found a statistically significant large effect size (g = 0. 85 [95% CI of 0.57–1.14]; p < .001), indicating a large overall effect of computational thinking integration on STEM learning outcomes. The effect sizes were significantly moderated by intervention durations. We provide a discussion of the findings and present implications for future research and practice.

N2 - This study investigated young children’s computational thinking (CT) development by integrating ScratchJr into a programming curriculum. Twelve third graders (six males and six females) voluntarily participated in an experiment-based computer class conducted at a public elementary school in Taiwan. This study adopted a case study methodology to investigate research questions in one specific case (8-week CT educational training). A one-group quasi-experimental pretest and posttest design with the support of qualitative observation was used to examine four research topics: CT competence progress, programming behaviors in a CT framework, factors influencing CT competence, and learning responses to CT training. The quantitative results indicated that students immersing in weekly programming projects significantly improved in terms of their CT competence, which was mostly retained 1 month after completion of the class. The programming behaviors indicated that students’ CT concepts (sequence, event, and parallelism) and practice (testing and debugging as well as reusing and remixing) significantly improved. Moreover, parents’ active involvement in take-home assignments influenced students’ long-term CT competence retention. The qualitative results indicated that students enjoyed using tablet computers to learn ScratchJr programming and demonstrated various leaning behaviors in a three-stage instructional design model.

N2 - Scholars believe that computational thinking is one of the essential competencies of the 21st century and computer programming courses have been recognized as a potential means of fostering students’ computational thinking. In tradition instruction, PFCT (problem identification, flow definition, coding, and testing) is a commonly adopted procedure to guide students to learn and practice computer programming. However, without further guidance, students might focus on learning the syntax of computer programming language rather than the concept of solving problems. This study proposes a peer-assessment-supported PFCT (PA-PFCT) approach for boosting students’ computer programming knowledge and computational thinking awareness. A quasi-experiment was conducted on a computer programming course in a high school to evaluate its influence on students’ learning achievement, computational thinking awareness, learning motivation, and self-efficacy. An experimental group of 51 students learned with the proposed approach, while a control group of 49 students learned with the traditional PFCT (T-PFCT) approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly enhanced the students’ computational thinking awareness, learning motivation, and self-efficacy, while not having significant impacts on their computer programming knowledge test scores.

N2 - This study proposed plugged and unplugged approaches for young students to simultaneously improve their interdisciplinary learning performance in English and Computational Thinking (CT). The plugged approach involved adopting educational robots to enhance CT and to provide English vocabulary and sentence practice via a board game. The unplugged version of the educational board game involved using a conventional board game without a computer, although it was designed for practicing CT as well as some foreign language vocabulary and conversational sentences. The results show that both approaches were helpful for simultaneously improving the students’ English proficiency of the target vocabulary and sentences, and their CT competence. The students’ foreign language learning anxiety during the English conversation in the plugged game was significantly lower than that of the students playing the unplugged game. On one hand, the cooperation tendency of the CT scale improved significantly for the students playing the unplugged game. On the other hand, the critical thinking of the CT scale improved significantly for those using the plugged approach. This research provides an innovation development and evaluation for plugged and unplugged approaches.

In particular, this study identifies the assessment tools and strategies that public library staff use to evaluate the success of CT youth programming, as well as how they share these assessment results, what they share, and with whom. This work also examines the perceptions of library staff on assessment of CT learning in libraries. Through our work, we highlight the need for a change of mindset in the perception of library staff toward assessment of CT learning in libraries. We also demonstrate the need for suitable assessment strategies to measure learning in CT programming in libraries beyond attendance and retention, that communicate to library staff on how they can revise their programs and to share their program impact with library stakeholders who make decisions on budget and resource allocations.

Debugging is particularly underrepresented in the CT training literature. This multi-level meta-analysis focused on debugging as a core CT skill, and investigated the effects of various debugging interventions. Moderator analyses revealed which interventions were effective, in which situations, and for what kind of learner. A significant overall mean effect of debugging interventions ( = 0.64, CI = (0.32, 0.96), p < .001), was found based on 62 effect sizes from 18 source articles. Significant between-studies variation indicated that true effects could range from −0.54 to 1.82. In addition, sensitivity analyses and checks on confounding provided further understandings of intervention features and their impacts. Interventions using enhanced debuggers and systematic instruction were particularly effective in fostering debugging skills. Debugging intervention effects varied by participant population and potentially by publication type. Moreover, debugging interventions had impact regardless of how debugging skills were measured, programming medium used, control-group type, and whether the study was randomized. Future studies should investigate the best practices for improving debugging abilities for whom and under what circumstances.

N2 - The interest in Computational Thinking (CT) development among young learners increases with the number of studies located in literature. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to address two main objectives: (a) the effectiveness of empirical interventions on the development of CT in children aged of 3–8 years; and (b) the variables that influence the effectiveness of the interventions. Following PRISMA procedures, we identified 17 empirical studies with 34 effect sizes and 1665 participants meeting the inclusion criteria from Web of Science database. Overall, we found a statistically significant large effect size (d = .83 [95% CI: 730, .890]; p < .001) on the CT development of 3–8 years old children, which provides empirical support for having young children to engage in CT experiences. The effect size was significantly influenced by moderating variables including gender, scaffolding, and education level. Intervention length showed a marginally significant effect. Therefore, educators could refer to the significant moderators when designing tailored interventions for CT development in early childhood education while a call for more empirical studies of CT development in young children is proposed.

N2 - This paper examined the effect of the Unplugged Programming Teaching Aids (UPTA) on students’ computational thinking and classroom interaction. A set of UPTA was created and used in a primary school in southern China. A total of 48 students aged 6–8 were assigned to two classes, with the same instructor and learning materials, but only the treatment group was provided with the UPTA. Both groups were tested on computational thinking ability, children’s concrete operation status, degree of ego-centricity, and in-classroom interaction. Results indicated that the children aged 6–8 years old could classify things according to two kinds of criteria at the same time, but their cognitive style was still ego-centered and they found it difficult to deal with problems from a third-party perspective, no matter whether in the treatment group or the control group. However, students in the treatment group achieved significantly higher scores on the test of computational thinking and were more engaged in the classroom interaction patterns. These findings provide evidence of the positive effect of the UPTA on promoting children’s computational thinking by guiding them to decompose and solve problems, as well as enhancing their interaction and communication in the classroom, so as to transform from simple imitation to collaborative inquiry.

N2 - The paper presents computational fluid dynamics-based numerical simulation of the through-thickness air permeability of woven structures, applying the theory of jet systems. The flow through the interstices between the warp and weft threads is modeled as an “in-corridor”-ordered jet system, formed by nine jets, issuing from nine pores of the woven structure. Fifteen cases were simulated and three different turbulence models were applied in the simulation: k-ɛ, k-ω and Reynolds stress model. The five simulated woven structures were manufactured and their air permeability was measured experimentally. The performed validation of the numerical results with the experimental values of the air permeability showed very good correlation with the experimental results. The analysis and the verification showed that the method can be applied for further investigation not only of the woven fabrics’ air permeability, but also for investigation of the flow after a textile barrier of a woven type.

The model is designed and tested with a further aim to investigate how infants may learn to communicate by means of spoken language. The computational model makes use of a memory, a perception module, and the concept of “learning drive”. Learning takes place within a communicative loop between a “caregiver” and the “learner”. Experiments carried out on three European languages with different genetic background (Finnish, Swedish, and Dutch) show that a robust word representation can be learned in using less than 100 acoustic tokens (examples) of that word. The model is inspired by the memory structure that is assumed functional for human cognitive processing.

N2 - The aim of this paper is to outline a priori performance evaluation approaches for distributed solution concepts of simulation-based optimization problems. Practical optimization problems, a distributed solution approach, and specific characteristics of the situation are presented. This parallel system is then analyzed according to both approaches of computational complexity and scalability. To overcome the resulting drawbacks, the integration of a posteriori aspects is necessary. Thus, a generic metric is established providing a posteriori knowledge at early stages of the optimization process.

N2 - The establishment of a healthy indoor environment requires the accurate evaluation of an individual’s exposure to pollutants. The concentration of indoor chemical pollutants is a representative indicator for such evaluation and is generally measured on-site. Moreover, material flow analysis (MFA), using macroscopic statistical data, is a reasonable method for objectively evaluating pollution on a wide scale; however, no effective strategy exists for the prediction of indoor air pollution, nor for the assessment of an individual’s exposure from social stock data. Accordingly, we developed a novel integration method comprising MFA and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with a computer-simulated person (CSP) to establish a framework for evaluating indoor pollutant concentration and individual exposure of residents. We focused on diethyl-hexyl phthalate (DEHP) and first estimated the amount of DEHP-containing product accumulation in Japan by MFA. Second, we conducted a thorough survey and measurement of DEHP emission rates. Using these results as boundary conditions for indoor CFD with CSP, the individual exposure of a resident, in a standard residential house, was quantitatively evaluated. The total daily exposure per unit of body weight was estimated to be more than 100 (μg/kg/d) in the worst-case scenario which was considered the upper limit for exposure in this analysis.

N2 - Abstract This study focuses on a simulation strategy that will allow the performance characteristics of an isolated gas turbine engine component, resolved from a detailed, high-fidelity analysis, to be transferred to an engine system analysis carried out at a lower level of resolution. The technique described in this paper is called ‘de-coupled’ high-fidelity analysis and utilizes an object-oriented, zero-dimensional gas turbine modelling and performance simulation system and a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) component model. The technique involves the generation of a component characteristic map without the parallel or iterative execution of the non-dimensional cycle and the three-dimensional CFD model. Therefore, a faster high-fidelity engine performance simulation can be achieved at run time. This paper demonstrates the ‘de-coupled’ approach to component high-fidelity analysis by using a three-dimensional CFD intake model of a high by-pass ratio turbofan as a case study. The CFD model is based on the geometry of the intake of the CFM56-5B2 engine. The CFD-generated performance map can fully define the characteristics of the intake at several operating conditions and power settings, and is subsequently used to provide a more accurate, physics-based estimate of intake performance (i.e. pressure recovery) and hence, engine performance, replacing the default, empirical values within the non-dimensional cycle model. A detailed comparison between the baseline engine performance (empirical pressure recovery) and the engine performance obtained after using the CFD-generated map is presented in this paper. The analysis carried out by this study demonstrates relative changes in the simulated engine performance > 1 per cent.

N2 - This article presents an experimental and computational study of the efficiency of an unshrouded transonic turbine. This research formed part of the EU Turbine Aero-Thermal External Flows II programme. The experiments were performed in the Oxford Turbine Research Facility (previously the Turbine Test Facility at QinetiQ, Farnborough). This facility is an engine scale, short duration, rotating transonic facility, in which M, Re, , and are matched to engine conditions. For these experiments, the MT1 turbine stage was installed. Historically, turbine efficiency measurements are conducted in steady state adiabatic facilities. However, short-duration facilities allow simultaneous aerodynamic and heat transfer measurements with a significant reduction in cost. An efficiency measurement system was developed for this investigation, and this is briefly described. The system allows efficiency to be evaluated to bias and precision errors of approximately ±1.45 per cent and ±0.16 per cent, respectively, to 95 per cent confidence. The results of accurate area surveys of the turbine inlet and exit flows are presented and discussed. At the turbine exit, data were taken at two traverse planes, approximately 0.5 and 4.5 rotor axial chords downstream of the rotor. The turbine efficiency was experimentally evaluated based on the data at both planes, using a number of mixing models, which are discussed and compared. The experimental result of turbine efficiency is also compared to that estimated from a mean-line prediction. Full-stage steady and unsteady computational fluid dynamics of the experiment using the Rolls-Royce HYDRA code was conducted and is also presented. The predicted and measured rotor exit flow-fields are compared at both downstream traverse planes.

N2 - The capacity to explain important elements of social life is central both to the development of sociological theory and to teaching sociology. This research seeks to expand our understanding of sociological explanation through a computational approach. Explanations commonly encountered in introductory sociology texts are used to develop a typology of explanatory forms. A computational strategy that represents sociological knowledge using a combination of frames, semantic networks, and procedural rules is described. It is then demonstrated that this approach can generate the full range of these explanations for all logical combinations of conditions and for the full scope of sociological knowledge. This approach is also shown to be capable of identifying appropriate explanations, assessing the quality of explanations, and generating new insights.

N2 - During crisis situations, teams are more prone to coordination breakdowns that are characterized by a temporary, diminished ability to function effectively as a team. However, team research currently lacks robust approaches for identifying transitions from effective team functioning to coordination breakdowns. With the current study, we aimed to develop such robust approaches, and to deepen our understanding of how team coordination dynamics across various physiological signals reflect coordination breakdowns. Consequently, we used audiovisual data from four-person teams involved in a stressful collaborative game task to manually identify coordination breakdowns. Next, we set out to computationally identify coordination breakdowns by applying continuous measures of team coordination (windowed synchronization coefficient and multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis) to photoplethysmogram and electrodermal activity data obtained during the task, and identifying transitions therein with change point and nonlinear prediction algorithms. We found that our computational coordination breakdown identification approaches can identify up to 96% of the manually identified coordination breakdowns although our results also show that the precision of our approaches falls far behind. Our findings contribute theoretically and methodologically to the systematic investigation of coordination breakdowns, which may ultimately facilitate the support of teams in responding to and mitigating negative consequences of crisis situations.

Practical optimization problems, a distributed solution approach, and specific characteristics of the situation are presented. This parallel system is then analyzed according to both approaches of computational complexity and scalability. To overcome the resulting drawbacks, the integration of a posteriori aspects is necessary. Thus, a generic metric is established providing a posteriori knowledge at early stages of the optimization process.

N2 - Saint Louis encephalitis virus, a member of the flaviviridae subgroup, is a culex mosquito-borne pathogen. Despite severe epidemic outbreaks on several occasions, not much progress has been made with regard to an epitope-based vaccine designed for Saint Louis encephalitis virus. The envelope proteins were collected from a protein database and analyzed with an in silico tool to identify the most immunogenic protein. The protein was then verified through several parameters to predict the T-cell and B-cell epitopes. Both T-cell and B-cell immunity were assessed to determine that the protein can induce humoral as well as cell-mediated immunity. The peptide sequence from 330–336 amino acids and the sequence REYCYEATL from the position 57 were found as the most potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes, respectively. Furthermore, as an RNA virus, one important thing was to establish the epitope as a conserved one; this was also done by in silico tools, showing 63.51% conservancy. The epitope was further tested for binding against the HLA molecule by computational docking techniques to verify the binding cleft epitope interaction. However, this is a preliminary study of designing an epitope-based peptide vaccine against Saint Louis encephalitis virus; the results awaits validation by in vitro and in vivo experiments.

N2 - Bioreactor system has been used in bone tissue engineering in order to simulate dynamic nature of bone tissue environments. Perfusion bioreactors have been reported as the most efficient types of shear-loading bioreactor. Also, combination of forces, such as rotation plus perfusion, has been reported to enhance cell growth and osteogenic differentiation. Mathematical modeling using sophisticated infrastructure processes could be helpful and streamline the development of functional grafts by estimating and defining an effective range of bioreactor settings for better augmentation of tissue engineering. This study is aimed to conduct computational modeling for newly designed bioreactors in order to alleviate the time and material consuming for evaluating bioreactor parameters and effect of fluid flow hydrodynamics (various amounts of shear stress) on osteogenesis. Also, biological assessments were performed in order to validate similar parameters under implementing the perfusion or rotating and perfusion fluid motions in bioreactors’ prototype. Finite element method was used to investigate the effect of hydrodynamic of fluid flow inside the bioreactors. The equations used in the simulation to calculate the velocity values and consequently the shear stress values include Navier–Stokes and Brinkman equations. It has been shown that rotational fluid motion in rotating and perfusion bioreactor produces more velocity and shear stress compared with perfusion bioreactor. Moreover, implementing the perfusion together with rotational force in rotating and perfusion bioreactors has been shown to have more cell proliferation and higher activity of alkaline phosphatase enzyme as well as formation of extra cellular matrix sheet, as an indicator of bone-like tissue formation.

N2 - A computational approach to visual perception is outlined. The investigation centres on two problems. One concerns the shape, and the other the edges, of dot figures. In determining edges it is not possible to delimit arbitrarily the region on which each point computes. So in this context a global computation is defined. This leads to a novel way of investigating clustering. When the edges of a figure have been sequenced to yield the boundary it is then possible to determine its shape. The study of shape has been confined to convex figures. In these an attempt is made to extract global units which correspond to corner-like regions. Finally, it is suggested that a theory which evolves in the manner described has a more unitary aspect than other approaches.

N2 - Background and purpose: Computational fluid dynamics method (CFDM) and optical flow method (OFM) effectively provide the hemodynamic information based on the digital subtraction angiogram (DSA). However, the quantitative analysis in comparison of CFDM and OFM is still absent. The goal of this study is to apply CFDM and OFM in quantitative analysis of stenting treatment. Material and method: A left carotid stenosis patient underwent stenting of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was analyzed as an example. CFDM and OFM for hemodynamic analysis on digital subtraction angiography before and after stenting treatment were presented. Results: Improvement gains of blood flow velocities on left internal carotid artery after stenting treament for different initial conditions on the common carotid artery were 1.91 ∼ 2.13, 1.62 ∼ 2.09, and 0.69 by CFDM with Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids and OFM, respectively. With the CFDM analysis, the flow mapping by OFM using time resolved DSA data on the fly to estimate hemodynamic significance of a cervical carotid stenosis was explained. Conclusion: Quantificative blood flow estimations by CFDM and OFM to evaluate the treatment outcomes to patient with carotid stenosis are practical. Both methods are able to provide quantitative information of blood flow for stenting treatment. It is advantagious to use both methods in treatment evaluation.

N2 - Study Design Mechanical simulations. Objective Inadequate calibration of annuli negatively affects the computational accuracy of finite element (FE) models. Specifically, the definition of annulus average radius (AR) does not have uniformity standards. Differences between the elastic moduli in the different layers and parts of the annulus were not fully calibrated when a linear elastic material is used to define its material properties. This study aims to optimize the computational accuracy of the FE model by calibrating the annulus. Methods We calibrated the annulus AR and elastic modulus in our anterior-constructed lumbar model by eliminating the difference between the computed range of motion and that measured by in vitro studies under a flexion-extension loading condition. Multi-indicator validation was performed by comparing the computed indicators with those measured in in vitro studies. The computation time required for the different models has also been recorded to evaluate the computational efficiency. Results The difference between computed and measured ROMs was less than 1% when the annulus AR and elastic modulus were calibrated. In the model validation process, all the indicators computed by the calibrated FE model were within ±1 standard deviation of the average values obtained from in vitro studies. The maximum difference between the computed and measured values was less than 10% under nearly all loading conditions. There is no apparent variation tendency for the computational time associated with different models. Conclusion The FE model with calibrated annulus AR and regional elastic modulus has higher computational accuracy and can be used in subsequent mechanical studies.

N2 - Introduction: The emergence of new omics approaches, such as genomic algorithms to identify tumor mutations and molecular modeling tools to predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins, has facilitated the understanding of the dynamic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of low-grade gliomas including oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. Methods: In this study, we targeted known mutations involved in low-grade gliomas, starting with the sequencing of genomic regions encompassing exon 4 of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) and the four exons (5-6 and 7-8) of TP53 from 32 samples, followed by computational analysis to study the impact of these mutations on the structure and function of 3 proteins IDH1, IDH2, and p53. Results: We obtain a mutation that has an effect on the catalytic site of the protein IDH1 as R132H and on the catalytic site of the protein IDH2 as R172M. Other mutations at p53 have been identified as K305N, which is a pathogenic mutation; R175 H, which is a benign mutation; and R158G, which disrupts the structural conformation of the tumor suppressor protein. Conclusion: In low-grade gliomas, mutations in IDH1, IDH2, and TP53 may be the key to tumor progression because they have an effect on the function of the protein such as mutations R132H in IDH1 and R172M in IDH2, which change the function of the enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate, or R158G in TP53, which affects the structure of the generated protein, thus their importance in understanding gliomagenesis and for more accurate diagnosis complementary to the anatomical pathology tests.

N2 - Programming learning has become an essential literacy for computer science (CS) and non-CS students in the digital age. Researchers have addressed that students’ conceptions of learning influence their approaches to learning, and thus impact their learning outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to uncover students’ conceptions of programming learning (CoPL) and approaches to programming learning (APL), and analyzed the differences between CS and non-CS students. Phenomenographic analysis was adopted to analyze 31 college students (20 CS-related, and 11 not) from northern Taiwan. Results revealed six categories of CoPL hierarchically: 1. memorizing concepts, logic, and syntax, 2. computing and practicing programming writing, 3. expressing programmers’ ideas and relieving pressure, 4. applying and understanding, 5. increasing one’s knowledge and improving one’s competence, and 6. seeing in a new way. Four categories of APL were also found, namely: 1. copying from the textbook, teachers, or others, 2. rote memory, 3. multiple exploration attempts, and 4. online or offline community interactions. Furthermore, we found that most CS students held higher level CoPL (e.g., seeing in a new way) than non-CS students. However, compared with non-CS students, CS students adopted more surface approaches to learning programming, such as copying and rote memory. Implications are discussed.

N2 - Contemporary education policy involves the integration of novel forms of data and the creation of new data platforms, in addition to the infusion of business principles into school governance networks, and intensification of socio-technical relations. In this paper, we examine how ‘computational rationality’ may be understood as intensifying of an instrumental set of logics in educational governance and decision making, and/or as opening up new explorations around the uncertainty and incompleteness of policy. We suggest that policy rationalities focused on prediction, transparency and data provide the conditions of possibility for Artificial Intelligence to be integrated into, and intensify aspects of, what we term ‘computational education policy’.

N2 - This article examines the impact of programming robots on sequencing ability in early childhood. Thirty-four children (ages 4.5–6.5 years) participated in computer programming activities with a developmentally appropriate tool, CHERP, specifically designed to program a robot’s behaviors. The children learned to build and program robots over three sessions, of 1.5 hours duration each, in a laboratory setting. The participants’ sequencing skills were assessed before and after the intervention using a picture-story sequencing task. Pre- and post-test scores were compared using a paired sample t-test. A significant increase in post-test scores compared to pre-test scores was found.

N2 - Rigidity of thought is considered a main characteristic of persons with Asperger syndrome (AS). This rigidity may explain the poor comprehension of unusual semantic relations, frequently exhibited by persons with AS. Research indicates that such deficiency is related to altered mental lexicon organization, but has never been directly examined. The present study used computational network science tools to compare the mental lexicon structure of persons with AS and matched controls. Persons with AS and matched controls generated free associations, and network tools were used to extract and compare the mental lexicon structure of the two groups. The analysis revealed that persons with AS exhibit a hyper-modular semantic organization: their mental lexicon is more compartmentalized compared to matched controls. We argue that this hyper-modularity may be related to the rigidity of thought which characterizes persons with AS and discuss the clinical and more general cognitive implications of our findings.

N2 - Partly presented in Interdisciplinary Transport Phenomena VII, Dresden, Germany, 19–23 September 2011.Compression moulding experiments of sheet moulding compound, visual observations of a vacuum test with prepregs and numerical models with two main approaches for computational fluid dynamics simulations of the mould filling phase are presented. One assumes that there are layers near the mould surfaces with much less viscosity and the other only use one viscosity model. The numerical experiments showed that the pressure could be accurately predicted with both approaches. The property necessary to predict correct pressure with altered mould closing velocities was that the bulk material had to obey shear-thinning effects. Preheating effects before compression were neglected, but altering the heating time until the prepreg was assumed to start flow had a significant effect. The experiments confirmed that the pressure is predominantly affected by the mould closing velocity. Regardless of the considered process settings, a first pressure top always appeared approximately at the logarithmic strain 0.25. A second top was associated with a slowdown of the press. The location of this was affected by the velocity and the vacuum, the latter indicating that vacuum assistance prevents a build-up of back pressure. Furthermore, heated prepreg above a critical temperature is observed to swell immediately as vacuum assistance is applied.

N2 - The convergence of systems neuroscience and open science arouses great interest in the current brain big data era, highlighting the thinking capability of intelligent agents in handling multi-source knowledge, information and data across various levels of granularity. To realize such thinking-inspired brain computing during a brain investigation process, one of the major challenges is to find a holistic brain map that can model multi-dimensional variables of brain investigations across brain functions, experimental tasks, brain data and analytical methods synthetically. In this paper, we propose a context-enhanced graph learning method to fuse open knowledge from different sources, including: contextual information enrichment, structural knowledge fusion, and holistic graph learning. Such a method can enhance contextual learning of abstract concepts and relational learning between two concepts that have large gap from different dimensions. As a result, an extensible space, namely Thinking Space, is generated to represent holistic variables and their relations in a map, which currently contributes to the field of brain research for systematic brain computing. In the future, the Thinking Space coupled with the rapid development and spread of artificial intelligence generated content will be developed in more scenarios so as to promote global interactions of intelligence in the connected world.

N2 - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the most important superfamily of protein targets in current ligand discovery and drug development. GPCRs are integral membrane proteins that play key roles in various cellular signaling processes. Therefore, GPCR signaling pathways are closely associated with numerous diseases, including cancer and several neurological, immunological, and hematological disorders. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) can expedite the process of GPCR drug discovery and potentially reduce the actual cost of research and development. Increasing knowledge of biological structures, as well as improvements on computer power and algorithms, have led to unprecedented use of CADD for the discovery of novel GPCR modulators. Similarly, machine learning approaches are now widely applied in various fields of drug target research. This review briefly summarizes the application of rising CADD methodologies, as well as novel machine learning techniques, in GPCR structural studies and bioligand discovery in the past few years. Recent novel computational strategies and feasible workflows are updated, and representative cases addressing challenging issues on olfactory receptors, biased agonism, and drug-induced cardiotoxic effects are highlighted to provide insights into future GPCR drug discovery.

N2 - Introduction: The emergence of new omics approaches, such as genomic algorithms to identify tumor mutations and molecular modeling tools to predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins, has facilitated the understanding of the dynamic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of low-grade gliomas including oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. Methods: In this study, we targeted known mutations involved in low-grade gliomas, starting with the sequencing of genomic regions encompassing exon 4 of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) and the four exons (5-6 and 7-8) of TP53 from 32 samples, followed by computational analysis to study the impact of these mutations on the structure and function of 3 proteins IDH1, IDH2, and p53. Results: We obtain a mutation that has an effect on the catalytic site of the protein IDH1 as R132H and on the catalytic site of the protein IDH2 as R172M. Other mutations at p53 have been identified as K305N, which is a pathogenic mutation; R175 H, which is a benign mutation; and R158G, which disrupts the structural conformation of the tumor suppressor protein. Conclusion: In low-grade gliomas, mutations in IDH1, IDH2, and TP53 may be the key to tumor progression because they have an effect on the function of the protein such as mutations R132H in IDH1 and R172M in IDH2, which change the function of the enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate, or R158G in TP53, which affects the structure of the generated protein, thus their importance in understanding gliomagenesis and for more accurate diagnosis complementary to the anatomical pathology tests.

N2 - Programming learning has become an essential literacy for computer science (CS) and non-CS students in the digital age. Researchers have addressed that students’ conceptions of learning influence their approaches to learning, and thus impact their learning outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to uncover students’ conceptions of programming learning (CoPL) and approaches to programming learning (APL), and analyzed the differences between CS and non-CS students. Phenomenographic analysis was adopted to analyze 31 college students (20 CS-related, and 11 not) from northern Taiwan. Results revealed six categories of CoPL hierarchically: 1. memorizing concepts, logic, and syntax, 2. computing and practicing programming writing, 3. expressing programmers’ ideas and relieving pressure, 4. applying and understanding, 5. increasing one’s knowledge and improving one’s competence, and 6. seeing in a new way. Four categories of APL were also found, namely: 1. copying from the textbook, teachers, or others, 2. rote memory, 3. multiple exploration attempts, and 4. online or offline community interactions. Furthermore, we found that most CS students held higher level CoPL (e.g., seeing in a new way) than non-CS students. However, compared with non-CS students, CS students adopted more surface approaches to learning programming, such as copying and rote memory. Implications are discussed.

N2 - Apoptosis is the phenotypic result of an active, regulated process of self-destruction. Following various cellular insults, apoptosis has been demonstrated in numerous unicellular eukaryotes, but very little is known about the genes and proteins that initiate and execute this process in this group of organisms. A bioinformatic approach presents an array of powerful methods to direct investigators in the identification of the apoptosis machinery in protozoans. In this review, we discuss some of the available computational methods and illustrate how they may be applied using the identification of a Plasmodium falciparum metacaspase gene as an example.

N2 - Contemporary education policy involves the integration of novel forms of data and the creation of new data platforms, in addition to the infusion of business principles into school governance networks, and intensification of socio-technical relations. In this paper, we examine how ‘computational rationality’ may be understood as intensifying of an instrumental set of logics in educational governance and decision making, and/or as opening up new explorations around the uncertainty and incompleteness of policy. We suggest that policy rationalities focused on prediction, transparency and data provide the conditions of possibility for Artificial Intelligence to be integrated into, and intensify aspects of, what we term ‘computational education policy’.

N2 - This article examines the impact of programming robots on sequencing ability in early childhood. Thirty-four children (ages 4.5–6.5 years) participated in computer programming activities with a developmentally appropriate tool, CHERP, specifically designed to program a robot’s behaviors. The children learned to build and program robots over three sessions, of 1.5 hours duration each, in a laboratory setting. The participants’ sequencing skills were assessed before and after the intervention using a picture-story sequencing task. Pre- and post-test scores were compared using a paired sample t-test. A significant increase in post-test scores compared to pre-test scores was found.

N2 - The objective of data compression is to avoid redundancy in order to reduce the size of the data to be stored or transmitted. In some scenarios, data compression may help to increase global performance by reducing the amount of data at a competitive cost in terms of global time and energy consumption. We have introduced computational compression as a technique for reducing redundant computation, in other words, to avoid carrying out the same computation with the same input to obtain the same output. In some scenarios, such as simulations, graphic processing, and so on, part of the computation is repeated using the same input in order to obtain the same output, and this computation could have an important cost in terms of global time and energy consumption. We propose applying computational compression by using memoization in order to store the results for future reuse and, in this way, minimize the use of the same costly computation. Although memoization was proposed for sequential applications in the 1980s, and there are some projects that have applied it in very specific domains, we propose a novel, domain-independent way of using it in high-performance applications, as a means of avoiding redundant computation.

N2 - Numerical analysis is increasingly used for batch modelling runs, with each individual model possessing a unique combination of input parameters sampled from a range of potential values. Whilst such an approach can help to develop a comprehensive understanding of the inherent unpredictability and variability of explosive events, or populate training/validation data sets for machine learning approaches, the associated computational expense is relatively high. Furthermore, any given model may share a number of common solution steps with other models in the batch, and simulating all models from birth to termination may result in large amounts of repetition. This paper presents a new branching algorithm that ensures calculation steps are only computed once by identifying when the parameter fields of each model in the batch becomes unique. This enables informed data mapping to take place, leading to a reduction in the required computation time. The branching algorithm is explained using a conceptual walk-through for a batch of 9 models, featuring a blast load acting on a structural panel in 2D. By eliminating repeat steps, approximately 50% of the run time can be saved. This is followed by the development and use of the algorithm in 3D for a practical application involving 20 complex containment structure models. In this instance, a ∼20% reduction in computational costs is achieved.

N2 - Abstract Performance of centrifugal fans with unshrouded impellers strongly depends upon complex configuration of the asymmetrical flowfield in the axial direction, which is highly unsteady. The flowfield, in turn, is considerably affected by the design parameters of both scroll and impeller geometry, for which tip clearance is of particular interest. This article presents a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the flowfield in three different unshrouded centrifugal fan impellers with varying tip clearances. A commercial CFD code, namely, Fluent V6.2.16 with a k-ɛ two-equation turbulence model was utilized in order to study the effects of tip clearance on the overall performance of each fan with the tip clearances ranging from 5 to 30 mm. The numerical results were compared with the experimental data reported previously in the literature by the present author and his colleagues, and excellent agreements were observed for each fan.

N2 - Abstract The term ‘whiplash’ was initially used to describe injuries to the neck caused by the head being forced backwards during a rear-end collision in cars without head restraints. The addition of head restraints in the 1970s was expected to solve this problem by preventing excessive extension of the neck but experience suggests the problem still exists. This paper reviews available experimental studies of whiplash and uses the data to construct a finite element model which is capable of dynamically simulating whiplash collisions and predicting the forces in all the relevant neck ligaments. For the first time, it is shown that trauma occurs long before the head hits the head restraint as a result of displacement between the head and the torso caused by the head’s inertia leading to markedly different acceleration histories. It is concluded that experimental and computational studies must be used together to produce progress in biomechanical studies.

N2 - Background: There is increasing evidence from animal and clinical studies that network hyperexcitability (NH) may be an important pathophysiological process and potential target for treatment in early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Measures of functional connectivity (FC) have been proposed as promising biomarkers for NH, but it is unknown which measure has the highest sensitivity for early-stage changes in the excitation/inhibition balance. Objective: We aim to test the performance of different FC measures in detecting NH at the earliest stage using a computational approach. Methods: We use a whole brain computational model of activity dependent degeneration to simulate progressive AD pathology and NH. We investigate if and at what stage four measures of FC (amplitude envelope correlation corrected [AECc], phase lag index [PLI], joint permutation entropy [JPE] and a new measure: phase lag time [PLT]) can detect early-stage AD pathophysiology. Results: The activity dependent degeneration model replicates spectral changes in line with clinical data and demonstrates increasing NH. Compared to relative theta power as a gold standard the AECc and PLI are shown to be less sensitive in detecting early-stage NH and AD-related neurophysiological abnormalities, while the JPE and the PLT show more sensitivity with excellent test characteristics. Conclusions: Novel FC measures, which are better in detecting rapid fluctuations in neural activity and connectivity, may be superior to well-known measures such as the AECc and PLI in detecting early phase neurophysiological abnormalities and in particular NH in AD. These markers could improve early diagnosis and treatment target identification.

N2 - In order to clarify the elasto-viscoplastic deformation behavior and strength of rubber blended semi-crystalline polymer, micro- to mesoscopic mechanical behavior was modeled by using large deformation finite element homogenization method. In this model, dimension of mesostructure is identified by the volume fraction of interface region around the rubber particles. The effects of strain rate and the size of rubber particles on the mesoscopic true stress—strain relation, strain rate distribution in mesoscopic area, and change in mesoscopic morphology with deformation are investigated by numerical simulation of uniaxial tensile deformation of semi-crystalline polymer with nonuniformly distributed rubber particles. A series of computational simulations clarified that mechanical behavior of blend polymer is strongly affected by the size of rubber particles. Mesoscopic true stress—strain relationship shows softening for blend polymer with large rubber particles, which is closely related to the distribution of strain rate on mesoscopic scale. When the rubber particles are large, local strain rate is highly concentrated in the ligament area between adjacent rubber particles, while it distributes in larger area of semi-crystalline polymer matrix in case of small rubber particles. The difference in these localized deformation leads to characteristic change in the size and shape of rubber particles with straining. Nonuniform deformation in mesoscopic area caused by heterogeneous rubber particle distribution is emphasized by high strain rate and large rubber particles. Furthermore, maximum mean stress generated in semi-crystalline polymer matrix is very high when the size of rubber particles is smaller than or ligament thickness is larger than a specific value. The specific thickness corresponds to the critical value for brittle-ductile transition of rubber blended semi-crystalline polymer obtained by impact test.

N2 - This study investigated the differences in programming novices’ intrinsic motivation and performance within a Scratch-based programming learning environment using a pretest–posttest intervention design. Specifically, this study aimed to examine what and how achievement emotions were aroused to impact learners’ academic success during Scratch implementation processes by employing regression analyses. One hundred and seventy-two undergraduates (Mage = 20.44, SDage = 1.09, 55.8% female) were voluntarily recruited to participate in a Scratch-based instruction workshop during a 6-week period. The workshop was structured with regard to preparation, Scratch-based programming learning and projects, and assessment activities and questionnaire implemented both before the instructional period and after the workshop. The results suggested that the Scratch-based intervention significantly increased students’ overall motivation and examination performance. Concerning achievement emotions, the outcome emotion of hopelessness first negatively predicted students’ motivation and performance. Anxiety then replaced hopelessness as a negative predictor, while enjoyment was the strongest predictor of motives and performance. Taking eight emotions together, the arousal of activity and outcome emotions within visual programming environments facilitated students’ emotion dynamics that impacted motivation and performance. The discussion and contributions concerning the mechanism behind the effectiveness of visualization and the emotion-performance relationship are presented herein.

N2 - Massive Open Online Courses have become a frequent platform for learners to acquire knowledge. This study aims to explore multiple factors influencing learner retention in MOOCs during the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this, we collected quantitative and qualitative data from questionnaires and qualitative data from interviews and then analyzed them through the Partial Least Square–Structural Equation Modeling to test 14 research hypotheses. The proposed research model and research hypotheses are empirically tested with 243 participants across the world. According to the results, support is found for all of the 14 research hypotheses. We confirmed 14 factors influencing learner retention in MOOCs. The result is beneficial for designers and manufacturers of MOOCs to improve the quality of the products and facilitate online or blended learning during this special time. It could also help students improve their learning experiences. Future research could examine influencing factors of learner retention in MOOCs with interdisciplinary cooperation.

N2 - In the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, waste is oft framed as an economic problem typically addressed in a building’s construction and demolition phase. Yet, architectural design decision-making can significantly determine construction waste outcomes. Following the logic of zero waste, this research addresses waste minimisation ‘at the source’. By resituating the problem of construction waste within the architectural design process, the research explores waste as a data and informational problem in a design system. Accordingly, this article outlines the creation of an integrated computational design decision support waste tool that employs a novel data structure combining HTML-scraped material data and historic building information modelling (BIM) data to generate waste evaluations in a browser-based 3D modelling platform. Designing an accessible construction waste tool for use by architects and designers aims to heighten awareness of the waste implications of design decisions towards challenging the systems of consumption and production that generate construction and demolition waste.

N2 - Despite the evolution of ventricular assist devices, ventricular assist device patients still suffer from complications due to the damage to blood by fluid dynamic stress. Since rotary ventricular assist devices are assumed to exert mainly shear stress, studies of blood damage are based on shear flow experiments. However, measurements and simulations of cell and protein deformation show normal and shear stresses deform, and potentially damage, cells and proteins differently. The aim was to use computational fluid dynamics to assess the prevalence of normal stress, in comparison with shear stress, in rotary ventricular assist devices. Our calculations showed normal stresses do occur in rotary ventricular assist devices: the fluid volumes experiencing normal stress above 10 Pa were 0.011 mL (0.092%) and 0.027 mL (0.39%) for the HeartWare HVAD and HeartMate II (HMII), and normal stresses over 100 Pa were present. However, the shear stress volumes were up to two orders of magnitude larger than the normal stress volumes. Considering thresholds for red blood cell and von Willebrand factor deformation by normal and shear stresses, the fluid volumes causing deformation by normal stress were between 2.5 and 5 times the size of those causing deformation by shear stress. The exposure times to the individual normal stress deformation regions were around 1 ms. The results clearly show, for the first time, that while blood within rotary ventricular assist devices experiences more shear stress at much higher magnitudes as compared with normal stress, there is sufficient normal stress exposure present to cause deformation of, and potentially damage to, the blood components. This study is the first to quantify the fluid stress components in real blood contacting devices.

N2 - A computational investigation of New MEXICO test cases operating under axial flow conditions is reported. Three wind speed cases (10, 15, 24 m/s) corresponding to three different tip speed ratios (10, 6.67, 4.17) when the turbine operates at 425.1 rpm were considered. ANSYS CFX 2021R1 was employed to perform simulations using Single Reference Frame (SRF) and Multiple Reference Frame (MRF) approaches. The flow field is computed by solving unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (uRANS) equations coupled with SST k-ω turbulence model and Gamma-Theta transition model. Validation involved comparing CFD-predicted integral quantities, static pressure distributions, and loads with corresponding experimental values demonstrating reasonably good agreement at all three wind speeds. Overall, SRF exhibited slightly better wake predictions (hypothetical), while MRF predictions were closer to measurements for integral quantities, static pressure and loads. This study demonstrates the utility of uRANS-based 3D CFD computations in wind turbine aerodynamics studies.

N2 - A computational fluid dynamics model of a bicuspid aortic valve has been developed using idealised three-dimensional geometry. The aim was to compare how the orifice area and leaflet orientation affect the hemodynamics of a pure bicuspid valve. By applying physiologic material properties and boundary conditions, blood flow shear stresses were predicted during peak systole. A reduced orifice area altered blood velocity, the pressure drop across the valve and the wall shear stress through the valve. Bicuspid models predicted impaired blood flow similar to a stenotic valve, but the flow patterns were specific to leaflet orientation. Flow patterns developed in bicuspid aortic valves, such as helical flow, were sensitive to cusp orientation. In conclusion, the reduced opening area of a bicuspid aortic valve amplifies any impaired hemodynamics, but cusp orientation determines subsequent flow patterns which may determine the specific regions downstream from the valve most at risk of clinical complications.

N2 - A new generation of science curriculum materials is being developed and made widely available across K–12. These materials, along with their associated professional learning, are expected to play a pivotal role in transforming science instruction to meet the vision of A Framework for K–12 Science Education and the performance expectations of the Next Generation Science Standards. This study investigated one of the first widely available middle school curriculum programs designed for the NGSS, Amplify Science 6–8. The study team conducted a randomized experiment to examine the implementation and efficacy of the middle school curriculum program (materials plus teacher professional learning) for improving seventh grade students’ learning in physical science. Findings show that students in schools where the program was implemented significantly outperformed peers in the comparison condition on an NGSS-focused physical science assessment. These findings underscore the importance of conducting additional research on NGSS-designed curriculum programs across other grade levels and within different science domains.

Three wind speed cases (10, 15, 24 m/s) corresponding to three different tip speed ratios (10, 6.67, 4.17) when the turbine operates at 425.1 rpm were considered. ANSYS CFX 2021R1 was employed to perform simulations using Single Reference Frame (SRF) and Multiple Reference Frame (MRF) approaches. The flow field is computed by solving unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (uRANS) equations coupled with SST k-ω turbulence model and Gamma-Theta transition model. Validation involved comparing CFD-predicted integral quantities, static pressure distributions, and loads with corresponding experimental values demonstrating reasonably good agreement at all three wind speeds. Overall, SRF exhibited slightly better wake predictions (hypothetical), while MRF predictions were closer to measurements for integral quantities, static pressure and loads. This study demonstrates the utility of uRANS-based 3D CFD computations in wind turbine aerodynamics studies.

N2 - Objectives To determine the site and nature of altered hemodynamics in pathological internal jugular veins. Method With the use of computational fluid mechanics software we simulated blood flow in 3 D models of the internal jugular veins that exhibited different morphologies, including nozzle-like strictures in their upper parts and valves in the lower parts. Results In a majority of models with nozzle-like strictures, especially those positioned asymmetrically, abnormal flow pattern was revealed, with significant flow separation and regions with reversed flow. Abnormal valves had no significant impact on flow in a case of already altered flow evoked by stricture in upper part of the vein. Conclusions In our jugular model, cranially-located stenoses, which in clinical practice are primarily caused by external compression, cause more significant outflow impact respect to endoluminal defects and pathological valves located more caudally.

N2 - Computational fluid dynamics for ship hydrodynamics has made monumental progress over the last ten years, which is reaching the milestone of providing first-generation simulation-based design tools with vast capabilities for model- and full-scale simulations and optimization. This is due to the enabling technologies such as free surface tracking/capturing, turbulence modeling, 6DoF motion prediction, dynamic overset grids, local/adaptive grid refinement, high performance computing, environmental modeling and optimization methods. Herein, various modeling, numerical methods, and high performance computing approaches for computational ship hydrodynamics are evaluated thereby providing a vision for the development of the next-generation high-fidelity simulation tools. Verification and validation procedures and their applications, including resistance and propulsion, seakeeping, maneuvering, and stability and capsize, are reviewed. Issues, opportunities, and challenges for advancements in higher-fidelity two-phase flow are addressed. Fundamental studies for two-phase flows are also discussed. Conclusions and future directions are also provided.

N2 - Precision of materialized designs is the conventional goal of digital fabrication in architecture. Recently, however, an alternative concept has emerged which refashions the imprecisions of digital processes into creative opportunities. While the computational design community has embraced this idea, its novelty results in a yet incomplete understanding. Prompted by the challenge of the still missing knowledge, this study explored imprecision in four digital fabrication approaches to establish how it influences the aesthetic attributes of materialized designs. Imprecision occurrences for four different digitally aided materialization processes were characterized. The aesthetic features emerging from these imprecisions were also identified and the possibilities of tampering with them for design exploration purposes were discussed. By considering the aesthetic potentials of deliberate imprecision, the study has sought to challenge the canon of high fidelity in contemporary computational design and to argue for imprecision in computation that shapes a new generation of designs featuring the new aesthetic of computational imperfection.

N2 - The aim of this study is to investigate the use of computational fluid dynamics in predicting the performance and geometry of the optimal design of a steam ejector used in a steam turbine. Many scholars have analysed the steam ejector using the ideal gas model, which lacks accuracy in terms of calculating the flow field of the ejector. This study is reported in a series of two papers. The first part covers the validation of CFX 11.0 results using different equations of state (EOS) on the converging–diverging nozzle flow field carried out with the experimental value. The IAPWS IF97 real gas model works well with the experimental value. The flow field of the ejector was analysed using different EOS after grid-dependent learning. The results show that the performance of the ejector was underestimated under the ideal gas model; the entrainment ratio was 20–40 per cent lower than when using the real gas model. The effect of the optimal geometrical design and operating conditions will be discussed in Part 2.

N2 - Genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can cause susceptibility to cancer. Although thousands of genetic variants have been identified to be associated with different cancers, the molecular mechanisms of cancer remain unknown. There is not a particular dataset of relationships between cancer and SNPs, as a bipartite network, for computational analysis and prediction. Link prediction as a computational graph analysis method can help us to gain new insight into the network. In this article, after creating a network between cancer and SNPs using SNPedia and Cancer Research UK databases, we evaluated the computational link prediction methods to foresee new SNP-Cancer relationships. Results show that among the popular scoring methods based on network topology, for relation prediction, the preferential attachment (PA) algorithm is the most robust method according to computational and experimental evidence, and some of its computational predictions are corroborated in recent publications. According to the PA predictions, rs1801394-Non-small cell lung cancer, rs4880-Non-small cell lung cancer, and rs1805794-Colorectal cancer are some of the best probable SNP-Cancer associations that have not yet been mentioned in any published article, and they are the most probable candidates for additional laboratory and validation studies. Also, it is feasible to improve the predicting algorithms to produce new predictions in the future.

N2 - Arterial hemodynamic forces may play a role in the localization of early atherosclerotic lesions. We have been developing numerical techniques based on overset or “Chimera” type formulations to solve the Navier–Stokes equations in complex geometries simulating arterial bifurcations. This paper presents three‐dimensional steady flow computations in a model of the rabbit aorto‐celiac bifurcation. The computational methods were validated by comparing the numerical results to previously‐obtained flow visualization data. Once validated, the numerical algorithms were used to investigate the sensitivity of the computed flow field and resulting wall shear stress distribution to various geometric and hemodynamic parameters. The results demonstrated that a decrease in the extent of aortic taper downstream of the celiac artery induced looping fluid motion along the lateral walls of the aorta and shifted the peak wall shear stress from downstream of the celiac artery to upstream. Increasing the flow Reynolds number led to a sharp increase in spatial gradients of wall shear stress. The flow field was highly sensitive to the flow division ratio, i.e., the fraction of total flow rate that enters the celiac artery, with larger values of this ratio leading to the occurrence of flow separation along the dorsal wall of the aorta. Finally, skewness of the inlet velocity profile had a profound impact on the wall shear stress distribution near the celiac artery. While not physiological due to the assumption of steady flow, these results provide valuable insight into the fluid physics at geometries simulating arterial bifurcations.

N2 - Abstract A hydrodynamic vortex separator (HDVS) has been modelled using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in order to accurately determine the residence time of the fluid at the two outlets of the HDVS using a technique that was developed for use in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). The results have been compared with experimental data [1]. It is shown that, in using CFD, it is possible to study the response to a variety of inputs, and also to determine the mean residence time of the fluid within the separator. Although the technique used for determining the residence time was developed for use in HVAC, it is shown here to be applicable for the analysis of hydraulic systems, specifically, wastewater treatment systems.

N2 - The aim of this article is to develop a three-dimensional computational model to simulate the traveling process of inlet distortion in fan and compressor with low calculated costs. The model is established based on the body force model in the framework of modern Computational Fluid Dynamics technology. The flow is assumed to be axisymmetric in each meridional blade passage. The impact of the solid blade shapes on airflow is modeled with blade blockage factor and blade body force. The relationships between blade body force and blade inlet Mach number together with attack angle are established with the deviation angle model and loss model. Meanwhile, the effect of the turbulent mixing is also taken into consideration. This developed computational code is then applied to the investigation of a transonic fan rotor and of a four-stage low-speed axial compressor under clean and distorted inlet condition. The predicted performance of both the fan rotor and the four-stage compressor with clean inlet are in line with the experimental results. A quantitative comparison is made between the computational results and the measurement data of the fan rotor with inlet distortion. Additionally, the transfer behavior of inlet distortion in the four-stage compressor is simulated by the model. All results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the model.

N2 - In this study, free-surface effects on swimming are investigated by the application of the computational fluid dynamics method for the first time. The major goal of this study is to represent a new methodology to numerically investigate free-surface effects on swimming. Utilizing a two-dimensional solver with steady flow conditions, the numerical results for swimming at a fully submerged level are validated with the data presented by previous researchers. The validity of the results is also examined through the study of mesh independency and the control of a critical turbulence feature, entitled as non-dimensional wall distance (y+). Finally, for the analysis of swimming at the free-surface level, a two-dimensional time-dependent solver with a well-known multiphase mathematical model is implemented to simultaneously investigate two-phase flow interactions and wave propagation in the proximity of the swimmer’s body. The development of different flow topology features, including major vortex cores and secondary recirculation zones as well as turbulence mixing and flow updraft and downdraft, are investigated and used to compare free-surface swimming against fully submerged cases. While the drag coefficient continuously decreases for higher advance velocities for a fully submerged case, a gradual augmentation is observed for the drag coefficient at a free-surface swimming level. The obtained results suggest that while the proportion of wave drag is ignorable at low swimming speeds below 1 m/s, in the case of higher speeds, its amount enhances significantly and constitutes about 15% of the total drag. Moreover, the proposed methodology is demonstrated to be efficient in the simulation of flow characteristics and phase interactions in swimming at the free-surface level.

N2 - Driver distraction is one of the major causes for fatal car accidents. In a distracting activity, manual distraction is a triggered response of other types of distraction, such as cognitive and visual distraction. Therefore, recognition of manual distraction can contribute to the monitoring of overall drivers’ distraction. In this study, a computer vision-based method to track hand movement from the recorded driving behavior is proposed. This method integrates a low computational cost template matching algorithm using fast normalized cross coefficient (NCC) and a novel searching strategy. The proposed method was evaluated by the VIVA hand tracking data set. It achieves 50.83% of marginal accuracy percentage (mAP), 42.18% of multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA), 31.56% of mostly tracked (MT), and 19.29% of mostly lost (ML), and it outperformed a state of the art algorithm in MOTA and MT. Additionally, the computational cost of the proposed method is greatly improved, and it can run at around 11.1 frames per second. The outcome of this research will further assist driving distraction recognition and mitigation, and improve driving safety.

N2 - Societies differ in susceptibility to social influence and in the social network structure through which individuals influence each other. What implications might these cultural differences have for changes in cultural norms over time? Using parameters informed by empirical evidence, we computationally modeled these cross-cultural differences to predict two forms of cultural change: consolidation of opinion majorities into stronger majorities, and the spread of initially unpopular beliefs. Results obtained from more than 300,000 computer simulations showed that in populations characterized by greater susceptibility to social influence, there was more rapid consolidation of majority opinion and also more successful spread of initially unpopular beliefs. Initially unpopular beliefs also spread more readily in populations characterized by less densely connected social networks. These computational outputs highlight the value of computational modeling methods as a means to specify hypotheses about specific ways in which cross-cultural differences may have long-term consequences for cultural stability and cultural change.

N2 - High-content screening (HCS) using RNA interference (RNAi) in combination with automated microscopy is a powerful investigative tool to explore complex biological processes. However, despite the plethora of data generated from these screens, little progress has been made in analyzing HC data using multivariate methods that exploit the full richness of multidimensional data. We developed a novel multivariate method for HCS, multivariate robust analysis method (M-RAM), integrating image feature selection with ranking of perturbations for hit identification, and applied this method to an HC RNAi screen to discover novel components of the DNA damage response in an osteosarcoma cell line. M-RAM automatically selects the most informative phenotypic readouts and time points to facilitate the more efficient design of follow-up experiments and enhance biological understanding. Our method outperforms univariate hit identification and identifies relevant genes that these approaches would have missed. We found that statistical cell-to-cell variation in phenotypic responses is an important predictor of hits in RNAi-directed image-based screens. Genes that we identified as modulators of DNA damage signaling in U2OS cells include B-Raf, a cancer driver gene in multiple tumor types, whose role in DNA damage signaling we confirm experimentally, and multiple subunits of protein kinase A.

N2 - Abstract The piston bowl design is one of the most important factors that affect the air/fuel mixing and the subsequent combustion and pollutant formation processes in a direct injection diesel engine. The bowl geometry and dimensions, such as the pip region, the bowl lip area and the torus radius, are all known to have an effect on the in-cylinder mixing and combustion process. In order to understand better the effect of the pip region, three piston bowls with different pip designs but with the same lip area and torus radius were designed and investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) engine modelling. A commercial CFD KIVA3V with improved submodels was used to model the in-cylinder flows and combustion process, and it was validated on a high-speed direct injection (HSDI) engine with a second-generation common rail fuel injection system. The engine performance, in-cylinder flow and combustion and emission characteristics were analysed at maximum power and maximum torque conditions and at part-load operating conditions. Three injector protrusions and injection timings were investigated at full load conditions. The effect of injection timing and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) at the part-load condition was considered.

N2 - The ideas of computational thinking (CT) and computer science (CS) are increasingly being integrated into K-12 education. Yet, insufficient attention exists regarding access and exposure of CT and CS for students with disabilities. In this Technology in Action, the authors sought to present an argument—as well as actual activities—for teachers to start to expose and engage students with disabilities in CT and CS. Through the presentation of case studies as well as other non-case situated activities, practical ideas, and steps for integrating CT and CS in mathematics teaching and learning for students with disabilities are presented.

N2 - In this paper, we explore the challenges experienced by a group of Primary 5 to 6 (age 12–14) students as they engaged in a series of problem-solving tasks through block-based programming. The challenges were analysed according to a taxonomy focusing on the presence of computational thinking (CT) elements in mathematics contexts: preparing problems, programming, create computational abstractions, as well as troubleshooting and debugging. Our results suggested that the challenges experienced by students were compounded by both having to learn the CT-based environment as well as to apply mathematical concepts and problem solving in that environment. Possible explanations for the observed challenges stemming from differences between CT and mathematical thinking are discussed in detail, along with suggestions towards improving the effectiveness of integrating CT into mathematics learning. This study provides evidence-based directions towards enriching mathematics education with computation.

N2 - Previous research has not adequately explored students’ behavioral processes when addressing computational thinking (CT) problems of varying difficulty, limiting insights into students’ detailed CT development characteristics. This study seeks to fill this gap by employing gamified CT items across multiple difficulty levels to calculate comprehensive behavioral sequence quality indicators. And then, through latent profile analysis, we identified four distinct latent classes of behavioral process. We then examined the in-game performance differences among these classes, uncovering each class’s unique attributes. Class 1 students consistently demonstrated high-quality, efficient behavioral sequences regardless of item difficulty. In contrast, class 2 students applied significant cognitive effort and trial-and-error strategies, achieving acceptable scores despite low behavioral sequence quality. Class 3 students excelled in simpler items but faltered with more complex ones. Class 4 students displayed low motivation for challenging items, often guessing answers quickly. Additionally, we investigated the predictive value of students’ performance in gamified items and their behavioral process classes for their external CT test scores. The study finally elaborated on the theoretical implications for researchers and the practical suggestions for teachers in CT cultivation.

N2 - The capability of computer programming language logic is one of the basics of technical education. How to improve students “interest in program logic design and help overcome students” fears of coding has become vital for educators. Cultivating practical talents with information technology application and basic programming development will become one of the important topics in the department of information related science. The objective of this research is to improve the ability of learning basic programming courses by using Zuvio interactive software. Zuvio employs the mathematical logic of computational thinking to analyze problems and enhance learners’ interest in learning programming skills through a graphical interface tool with building blocks. It uses innovative interactive teaching to use peer and self-assessment to study the content of the course. Zuvio improves the design ability of different groups of class learning Python programming. In line with the innovative teaching policy of the schools and the current stage of the learner’s learning model, learning effectiveness can be achieved. The research results were analyzed by midterm and final experimental group scores, and the progress of the experimental group’s scores was examined through descriptive statistics. The average and standard deviation of the assessment were used to analyze the progress of the experimental group students in the programming course. In the classroom, assessment criteria were set up as the basis for peer assessment scoring. After the midterm and final exams, the teacher assessment and peer assessment scores were analyzed for cognitive differences, and possible learning differences were analyzed. The students’ professional ability was examined to see if it met the professional standards required by the course, and whether innovative teaching methods could improve the learning outcomes of learners with different professional backgrounds in Python programming.

N2 - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education is essential for developing future-ready learners in both secondary and higher education levels. However, as students transition to higher education, many encounter challenges with independent learning and research. This can negatively impact their Higher-Order Thinking Skills (HOTS), engagement, and practical expertise. This study introduces a solution: Computational Thinking Scaffolding (CTS) in the Jupyter Notebook environment, designed to enhance STEM education at the tertiary level. CTS incorporates five phases: Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, Algorithm Design, and Evaluation. Utilizing a quasi-experimental method, we assessed the impact of CTS on the HOTS, engagement, and practical skills of undergraduate and postgraduate students. Our findings hold substantial relevance for university educators, academic advisors, and curriculum designers aiming to enhance students’ HOTS and hands-on capabilities in STEM disciplines. The results validate the effectiveness of CTS in elevating tertiary STEM learning outcomes, and they spotlight the adaptability of the Jupyter Notebook as a valuable tool in higher education. In conclusion, our research underscores the merits of CTS for improving outcomes in higher STEM education and sets a benchmark for future endeavors in this domain.

N2 - This article examines teacher preparation and teacher change in engineering and computer science education. We examined culturally responsive teaching self-efficacy (CRTSE), culturally responsive teaching outcome expectancy (CRTOE) beliefs, and attitudes toward computational thinking (CT) as teachers participated in one of three treatment groups: robotics only, game design only, or blended robotics/game design. Descriptive data revealed that CRTSE gain scores were higher in the robotics only and blended contexts than in the game design only context. However, CRTOE beliefs were consistent across all treatment groups. In regard to CT attitudes, teachers’ gain scores were higher in the game design only and blended contexts than in the robotics only context. In addition, there were differences by treatment group related to STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) practices, while cultural artifacts were evident in each learning environment. The results of this study reveal some variability by treatment type and inform future research on equitable practices in engineering and computer science education.

N2 - Although previous research has provided some insights into the effects of block-based and text-based programming modalities, there is a dearth of a detailed, multi-dimensional analysis of the transition process from different introductory programming modalities to professional programming learning. This study employed a quasi-experimental design to address this gap, involving 64 secondary school students in two groups. For the beginning five weeks, the first group used an introductory block-based programming environment, while the second group used an introductory text-based programming environment. Then, both groups transitioned to professional text-based programming for the subsequent eight weeks. The results showed that participants who transitioned from introductory text-based programming to professional text-based programming (1) significantly outperformed in computational thinking skills; (2) had more code-writing and debugging behaviors and fewer irrelevant behaviors, and (3) had more interactions with the instructor. No significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding enjoyment, confidence, and interest in programming. Drawing on these findings, this study proposes pedagogical implications that could facilitate the adoption of programming modalities within the broader context of STEM education.

N2 - Computational thinking (CT), as a new future-oriented literacy, has gained attention at the basic education level. Graphical programming is the common way to develop CT in primary students, but this drag-and-drop programming may weaken students’ understanding of programming’s abstract concepts and code logic. Text-based programming approaches can solve the problems faced by graphical programming, but few studies have explored the impact of text-based programming on CT. Therefore, we conducted a quasi-experimental study with 98 6th graders to explore the impact of gamified Python programming on CT. The findings showed that CT skills, as well as abstraction and decomposition, pattern recognition and evaluation in CT sub-skills, were significantly higher with students in the experimental group than in the control group. Furthermore, we found that gamified Python programming enabled boys and girls to reach the same level of CT skills. However, in terms of CT sub-skills, we found that gamified Python programming was more beneficial to the development of pattern recognition and evaluation skills for boys and abstraction and decomposition skills for girls. This demonstrated the effectiveness of gamified Python programming to improve primary students’ CT skills while clarifying the impact of gender and enriching research in the field of text-based programming.

N2 - A growing body of research is focusing on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and computational thinking (CT) to enhance student learning outcomes. Many researchers have designed instructional activities to achieve various learning goals within this field. Despite the prevalence of studies focusing on instructional design and student learning outcomes, how instructional efforts result in the integration of AI and CT in students’ learning processes remains unclear. To address this research gap, we conducted a systematic literature review of empirical studies that have integrated AI and CT for student development. We collected 18 papers from four prominent research databases in the fields of education and AI technology: Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, and ACM. We coded the collected studies, highlighting the students’ learning processes in terms of research methodology and context, learning tools and instructional design, student learning outcomes, and the interaction between AI and CT. The integration of AI and CT occurs in two ways: the integration of disciplinary knowledge and leveraging AI tools to learn CT. Specifically, we discovered that AI- and CT-related tools, projects, and problems facilitated student-centered instructional designs, resulting in productive AI and CT learning outcomes.

N2 - Computational Thinking (CT) is essential for developing creativity, problem-solving, and digital competence in the 21st century. Coding tools like robotic toys and tablet apps have become popular in early childhood education to support CT development, but there is a debate on which tool is more effective. Little evidence exists on the effect of coding on children’s Social-Emotional Competence (SEC), which is crucial for lifelong development and extends beyond cognitive development. This experimental study aimed to compare the effectiveness of two 9-week programs on promoting 73 preschool children’s CT and SEC, one using coding robots and the other using coding apps. The results showed that children who participated in the Coding Robot Program had higher CT scores than those in the Coding App Program, after controlling for age, gender, family socioeconomic status, and baseline CT scores. While the SEC scores showed no substantial disparities between the groups, it was revealed that the initial performance levels moderated the intervention effects on emotional regulation and overall SEC. This suggests that the Coding Robot Program could be especially advantageous for a subset of children who initially have difficulties with emotional regulation and social skills. Implications of this study are presented for research and practice.

N2 - Abstract This paper presents some results obtained during the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of internal flows inside a hydraulic component, using a scaling technique applied to numerical pre- and post-processing. The main aim of the work is to demonstrate the reduction of computational work needed for a complete analysis of component behaviour over a wide range of operating conditions. This result is achieved through the adoption of a methodology aimed at giving the highest level of generality to a non-dimensional solution, thereby overcoming the two major limitations encountered in the use of CFD in fluid power design: computer resources and time. In the case study, the technique was applied to a hydraulic distributor and computations were performed with a commercial computational fluid dynamics code. The key factor of this technique is the evaluation, for a given distributor opening, of the Reynolds number of the flow in the metering region. Provided that this number is high enough to ensure that the discharge coefficient has reached its asymptotic value, the characterization of the flow by a single non-dimensional numerical run can be shown. The theoretical contents of the analysis of the re-scaling technique, which focuses on the engineering information necessary in component design, are described in detail. The bases for its subsequent application to actual cases are then outlined. Finally, a fairly close correlation between numerical results and experimental data is presented.

N2 - The purpose of this descriptive study was to develop a computational fluency performance profile of 224 high school (Grades 9—12) students with mathematics disabilities (MD). Computational fluency performance was examined by grade-level expectancy (Grades 2—6) and skill area (whole numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division; rational numbers: fractions, decimals) using the Mathematics Operations Test— Revised (MOT-R). The findings indicated that these high school students with MD were fluent only in computational skills at the second- and third-grade levels. Computational fluency was found with most whole number basic facts in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Lack of computational fluency was demonstrated on many items dealing with subtraction of multiple digits or items requiring regrouping, most multiplication and division items, and rational number items involving fractions and decimals. The results are discussed in regard to instructional programs and curriculum organization for high school students with MD.

N2 - Research shows charter schools are more segregated by race and class than are traditional public schools. I investigate an underexamined mechanism for this segregation: Charter schools project identities corresponding to parents’ race- and class-specific parenting styles and educational values. I use computational text analysis to detect the emphasis on inquiry-based learning in the websites of all charter schools operating in 2015–16. I then estimate mixed linear regression models to test the relationships between ideological emphasis and school- and district-level poverty and ethnicity. I thereby transcend methodological problems in scholarship on charter school identities by collecting contemporary, populationwide data and by blending text analysis with hypothesis testing. Findings suggest charter school identities are both race and class specific, outlining a new mechanism by which school choice may consolidate parents by race and class—and paving the way for behavioral and longitudinal studies. This project contributes to literatures on school choice and educational stratification.

N2 - Background Patellar tendinopathy (jumper’s knee) is characterized by localized tenderness of the patellar tendon at its origin on the inferior pole of the patella and a characteristic increase in signal intensity on magnetic resonance imaging at this location. However, it is unclear why the lesion typically occurs in this area of the patellar tendon as surface strain gauge studies of the patellar tendon through the range of motion have produced conflicting results. Hypothesis The predicted patellar tendon strains that occur as a result of the tendon loads and patella-patellar tendon angles (PPTAs) experienced during a jump landing will be significantly increased in the area of the patellar tendon associated with patellar tendinopathy. Study Design Descriptive laboratory study. Methods A 2-dimensional, computational, finite element model of the patella-patellar tendon complex was developed using anatomic measurements taken from lateral radiographs of a normal knee. The patella was modeled with plane strain rigid elements, and the patellar tendon was modeled with 8-node plane strain elements with neo-Hookean material properties. A tie constraint was used to join the patellar tendon and patella. Patella-patellar tendon angles corresponding to knee flexion angles between 0° and 60° and patellar tendon strains ranging from 5% to 15% were used as input variables into the computational model. To determine if the location of increased strain predicted by the computational model could produce isolated tendon fascicle damage in that same area, 5 human cadaveric patella-patellar tendon-tibia specimens were loaded under conditions predicted by the model to significantly increase localized tendon strain. Pre- and posttesting ultrasound images of the patella–patellar tendon specimens were obtained to document the location of any injured fascicles. Results Localized tendon strain at the classic location of the jumper’s knee lesion was found to increase in association with an increase in the magnitude of applied patellar tendon strain and a decrease in the PPTA. The principal stresses and strains predicted by the model for this localized area were tensile and not compressive in nature. Applying the tendon strain conditions and PPTA predicted by the model to significantly increase localized strain resulted in disruption of tendon fascicles in 3 of the 5 cadaveric specimens at the classic location of the patellar tendinopathy lesion. Conclusion The localized increase in patellar tendon strain that occurs in response to the application of tendon loads and decreased PPTA could induce microdamage at the classic location of the jumper’s knee lesion. Clinical Relevance The association of decreasing PPTA with increasing localized tendon strain would implicate the role of knee-joint angle as well as tendon force in the etiopathogenesis of jumper’s knee.

N2 - Abstract This paper presents some results obtained during the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of internal flows inside a hydraulic component, using a scaling technique applied to numerical pre- and post-processing. The main aim of the work is to demonstrate the reduction of computational work needed for a complete analysis of component behaviour over a wide range of operating conditions. This result is achieved through the adoption of a methodology aimed at giving the highest level of generality to a non-dimensional solution, thereby overcoming the two major limitations encountered in the use of CFD in fluid power design: computer resources and time. In the case study, the technique was applied to a hydraulic distributor and computations were performed with a commercial computational fluid dynamics code. The key factor of this technique is the evaluation, for a given distributor opening, of the Reynolds number of the flow in the metering region. Provided that this number is high enough to ensure that the discharge coefficient has reached its asymptotic value, the characterization of the flow by a single non-dimensional numerical run can be shown. The theoretical contents of the analysis of the re-scaling technique, which focuses on the engineering information necessary in component design, are described in detail. The bases for its subsequent application to actual cases are then outlined. Finally, a fairly close correlation between numerical results and experimental data is presented.

N2 - People who interact with graphs to perform arithmetic tasks typically employ quantitative features. However, they may employ the spatial metaphor under two alternative conditions: if they have been trained to apply visual arithmetic methods to traditional line and bar graphs, or if they interact with specially constructed and special-purpose computational graphics. Two experiments explored a visual arithmetic method used to train subjects to determine a mean by locating the spatial midpoint of a set of indicators (bars in a bar graph or points in a line graph). In Experiment 1 visual arithmetic subjects determined the mean of five indicators as quickly as they did the mean of two indicators; control subjects performed slower with five indicators. Both groups took more time to add the values of five indicators than to add two indicators. In Experiment 2, unlike control subjects, visual arithmetic subjects’ response times in mean trials were unaffected by changes in the y-axis scale. However, both groups were affected by the y-axis scale on addition trials. Neither group was influenced by changes in the distance between indicators. The discussion addresses the transfer of visual arithmetic training to tasks that differ from the one used during training, uses for visual arithmetic and computational graphics, and the role of parallel processing and task restructuring in visual arithmetic.

The proposed method is unsupervised fuzzy classification performed by neural networks using the fuzzy Kohonen algorithm. GIS technology offers a powerful set of tools for the input, management, and output of data, whereas computational intelligence is used for the analysis and the classification of the data. The proposed methodology is applied to the municipality of Athens, in Greece. Finally the advantages and disadvantages of the approach are discussed.

N2 - Robotic tasks (e.g., kinematics and dynamics) are computation ally expensive. The majority of these tasks must be computed in real-time to meet the high sampling rate modes of oper ations. Recently parallel processing has been used to speed up these computations. In this work, we propose a graph- based algorithm to map computational tasks onto multiple instruction-multiple data (MIMD) type of architectures. The algorithm automatically generates the task graph of a given task. Then an annealing procedure is used to allocate the gen erated subtasks to different processors, taking into account the network topology and the communication constraints. Moreover, the proposed technique is simple, flexible, and computationally viable. The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated by a case study with good results.

N2 - How robust is a healthcare system? How does a patient navigate the system and what is the cost (e.g., number of medical services required or number of times the medical provider had to be changed to get access to the required medical services) incurred from the first symptoms to getting cured? How will it fare in the wake to a sudden epidemic or a disaster? How are all of these affected by administrative decisions such as allocating/diminishing resources in various areas or centralising services? These are the questions motivating our study on a formal prototype model for a healthcare system. We propose that a healthcare system can be understood as a distributed system with independent nodes (healthcare providers) computing according to their own resources and constraints, with tasks (patient needs) being allocated between the nodes. The questions about the healthcare system become in this context questions about resource availability and distribution between the nodes. We construct in this paper an Event-B model capturing the basic functionality of a simplified healthcare system: patients with different types of medical needs being allocated to suitable medical providers, and navigating between different providers for their turn for multi-step treatments.

N2 - The purpose of this study was to examine the relations of various cognitive abilities and aspects of math performance with computational estimation skill among third graders. Students (n= 315) were assessed on language, nonverbal reasoning, concept formation, processing speed, long–term memory, working memory, inattentive behavior, basic reading skill, arithmetic number combination skill, double–digit computation skill, and computational estimation ability. One–way analysis of variance indicated significant differences in estimation skill among students of low, average, and high math computation performance. The unique predictors of estimation skill were arithmetic number combination skill, nonverbal reasoning, concept formation, working memory, and inattentive behavior.

N2 - The aim of this study was to describe and compare perceptions of critical thinking, attitudes to and availability of research, research utilization and barriers to this among nursing students in Scandinavia and Indonesia. Data were collected at the beginning, middle and end of education from nursing students in Norway, Sweden (bachelor’s diploma) and Banda Aceh (bachelor’s diploma). Critical Thinking and Research Utilization Questionnaires were used along with the Barrier Scale. Descriptive analyses, comparisons between and within groups were performed. At the end of education, all samples exhibited positive attitudes to research and the main barrier was related to the setting. Scandinavian students reported higher critical thinking. Indonesian students perceived greater barriers on two Barrier subscales. No differences were found between the samples regarding research utilization. Significant changes over time varied among the samples except for the Norwegian sample. Indonesian students (diploma) exhibited most changes over time. Teachers must support nursing students to strengthen their critical thinking ability and develop professional competence.

N2 - Relatively little attention has been paid to the venous system and valves from a cardiovascular engineering perspective up to now. Given the involvement of venous valve haemodynamics in the development of deep vein thrombosis this is an area that needs more detailed investigation and close collaboration between clinicians and cardiovascular engineers. The purpose of this review article is to provide an indication of the physiological conditions that need to be included in any computational model of the venous system, based on recommendations from clinicians, and to summarize published computational models of the venous system by trying to explore their limitations and application range. A MEDLINE search was carried out on the relevant literature from 1940 until today. Several models have been developed with a specific purpose in mind to coincide with the aim of each individual study. The model complexity and laws used in each model vary significantly. There are more simplistic computational models based on electric circuit analogies, termed as lumped parameter models, which can be used to provide boundary conditions to one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) domain models, followed by 1D continuous models based on analytical equations, which allow the description of pressure wave and can be non-linear in nature. Finally, there are the more advanced 3D models, which are based on the principles of haemodynamics, and consider the compliance of the venous system and the effect that venous valves have on the cardiovascular system. In conclusion, it appears that computer modelling of the venous system can contribute greatly to our understanding of venous physiology and allow us to evaluate the haemodynamic interactions that occur in the venous system under different physiological conditions.

N2 - This study presents a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to simulate the three-dimensional airflow in the trachea before and after the vascular ring surgery (VRS). The simulation was based on CT-scan images of the patients with the vascular ring diseases. The surface geometry of the tracheal airway was reconstructed using triangular mesh by the Amira software package. The unstructured tetrahedral volume meshes were generated by the ANSYS ICEM CFD software package. The airflow in the tracheal airway was solved by the ESI CFD-ACE+ software package. Numerical simulation shows that the pressure drops across the tracheal stenosis before and after the surgery were 0.1789 and 0.0967 Pa, respectively, with the inspiratory inlet velocity 0.1 m/s. Meanwhile, the improvement percentage by the surgery was 45.95%. In the expiratory phase, by contrast, the improvement percentage was 40.65%. When the inspiratory velocity reached 1 m/s, the pressure drop became 4.988~Pa and the improvement percentage was 43.32%. Simulation results further show that after treatment the pressure drop in the tracheal airway was significantly decreased, especially for low inspiratory and expiratory velocities. The CFD method can be applied to quantify the airway pressure alteration and to evaluate the treatment outcome of the vascular ring surgery under different respiratory velocities.

The participants of the study were twenty-eight pre-service CS teachers studying at eighteen different universities in Türkiye. The data was gathered with a questionnaire consisting of open-ended questions. Results showed that inherent programming challenges, personal factors, and quality of undergraduate education affected pre-service CS teachers’ abilities in programming teaching. They were concerned about their professional lives relating to programming teaching, keeping up with technological innovations, pedagogical concerns, and teaching practice. They also suggested pedagogical approaches that could be used in programming teaching under two categories, namely basic programming teaching, and teaching principles and techniques. The study contributes to the development of programming teaching by shedding light on the current perspectives of pre-service CS teachers on programming education.

N2 - Depending on the characteristics of the cancer and the specific treatment required, each type of cancer comes with a unique set of challenges in the psychological wellbeing of women. This research work mainly focuses on Ovarian cancer since the it is one of the 5 leading cancers among women. As per the statistics of 2021, by the American Cancer Society, 21,410 women would be diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 13,770 women might die from ovarian cancer. Both physically and psychologically, ovarian cancer presents several challenges. To control the growth of the tumour, multiple treatments are required. The psychological issues in women with ovarian cancer is mainly due to “loss of femininity” that affects them while they proceed through the phases of diagnosis, treatment and recurrence. Psychological factors associated with both, having ovarian cancer and being at risk are considered in this study. In the proposed work, PHQ 9 and GAD 7 are the tools used to measure depression and anxiety among women who are undergoing treatment for ovarian cancer. The data, collected with the help of these tools, is analysed using the popular Machine Learning algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network etc. The results of Machine Learning algorithms are then compared with Mamdani and Sugeno fuzzy inference models. The Sugeno fuzzy inference system outperformed in comparison to all other models, with an accuracy of 96.2% for depression and 98.83% for anxiety, followed by Mamdani fuzzy inference system giving 94.3% accuracy for depression and 96.7% for anxiety. The performance is then compared with the linear SVM which obtained an accuracy of 91.52% for depression and 93.78% for anxiety. The analysed performance of the data using computational algorithms are compared with that of expert clinical psychologists. The severely affected women are advised to visit a psychiatrist.

N2 - Emergent phenomena—those that manifest bottom-up from the psychological characteristics, perceptions, and interactions among individuals—are a fundamental dynamic process in multilevel theory, but have been treated in a very limited way in the research literature. In particular, treatments are largely assumed (rather than observed directly), retrospective, and static. This paper describes a research paradigm designed to examine directly the dynamics of micro-meso—individual, dyad, and team—emergent phenomena. We identify, describe, and illustrate the sequence of theoretical, measurement, computational, data analytic, and systematic research activities that are necessary to operationalize and utilize the paradigm. We illustrate the paradigm development process using our research, focused on learning and team knowledge emergence, and highlight key design principles that can be applied to examine other emergent phenomena in teams. We conclude with a discussion of contributions, strengths and limitations, and generalization of the approach to other emergent phenomena in teams.

N2 - Different domains of software applications require that the project management’s development process be customized to its specific conditions and needs. One of the most widely used operation research is the development of a scientific software product. Numerous studies point to a wide gap among the various communities, processes, dynamics, etc., between the development of general software products and the development of computational scientific software products. This wide gap emphasizes the necessity for more suitable and more adjustable practices in project management and in the development of scientific software products. One of the most significant challenges in the development of scientific software is expressed in the different attitudes and expectations held by various stakeholders, in terms of the scope, objectives, and goals they envision for their software product. Although unique challenges in the development of scientific software arise at every stage of the process, we maintain that, by addressing the varying perspectives gap at the very outset of the project management process, one can reduce unwanted dynamics throughout the development process. A “project charter” is a critical formal statement that defines the scope, objectives and participants in a project in order to officially authorize the project and to ensure that everyone involved is aware of its purpose and objectives. Customization of the project charter can provide a response to the varying perspectives gap. This paper presents an approach to the generation of a customized project charter for scientific software products as an initial and essential step for the achievement of quality. We will demonstrate the implementation of the approach in one of our own scientific software development projects – a simulation software product used for the development of a fiber optic evanescent wave spectroscopy (FEWS) simulator.

N2 - We investigate a new approach for characterizing class separability based on topological measures for use with identifying flaw severity in plates. Multi-mode Lamb waves are propagated across a flat-bottom hole of varying depth. Lamb wave tomography reconstructions are first generated to locate and size the flaw at each depth. As the flaw depth increases, scattering and mode conversion effects dominate the raw time-domain signals, obscuring information about flaw severity. Pattern classification provides an alternate means for processing the ultrasonic waveforms to identify flaw severity. High-dimensional feature spaces are generated from the Lamb wave signals using the dynamic wavelet fingerprinting technique. In order to achieve high classification accuracy, an optimal feature space is required. An intelligent feature selection routine is explored here that identifies favorable class distributions in multidimensional feature spaces using computational homology theory. Betti numbers and formal classification accuracies are calculated for each feature space subset to establish a correlation between the topology of the class distribution and the corresponding classification accuracy.

N2 - Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010, a substantial body of research has focused on the development of computational tools and analytical frameworks for modeling oil spill events. Much of this work is dedicated to deepening our understanding of the interactions between oil, fragile ecosystems, and the environment, as well as the impacts of oil on human settlements which are vulnerable to spill events. These advances in oil spill modeling and associated analytics have not only increased the efficiency of spill interdiction and mitigation efforts, they have also helped to nurture proactive, versus reactive, response strategies and plans for local and regional stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to provide a progress report on the wide range of computational tools, analytical frameworks, and emerging technologies which are necessary inputs for a complete oil spill modeling package. Specifically, we explore the use of relatively mature tools, such as dedicated spill modeling packages, geographic information systems (GIS), and remote sensing, as well emerging technologies such as aerial and aquatic drones and other in-situ sensing technologies. The integration of these technologies and the advantages associated with using a geographic lens for oil spill modeling are discussed.

N2 - Self-expanding stents made of Nitinol, a Nickel–Titanium shape memory alloy, are used in standard medical implants for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Despite the increasing success, clinical studies have reported stent failure after the deployment in the human body, thus undermining patient’s safety and life. This study aims to fill the gap of reliable assessment of the fatigue life of Nitinol stents. We propose a global computational design method for preclinical validation of Nitinol stents, which can be extended to patient-specific computations. The proposed methodology is composed of a mechanical finite element analysis and a fatigue analysis. The latter analysis is based on a novel multiaxial fatigue criterion of the Dang Van type, combining the shakedown response of the stent and the complexity of phase transformation taking place within the material. The method is implemented in the case of a carotid artery stent. The implant configuration as well as the applied cyclic loading are shown to affect material phase evolution as well as stent lifetime. The comparison with the results obtained by applying a strain-based constant-life diagram approach allows to critically discuss both fatigue criteria and to provide useful recommendations about their applicability.

N2 - The paper presents a review of existing literature in the field of coupling Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with Building Energy Simulations (BES) to better predict indoor environmental conditions and building energy implications. CFD is capable of providing a detailed analysis of airflow profile and temperature gradients in the space as well as better prediction of heat transfer involving convection and radiation. Whereas BES can provide dynamically changing boundary conditions to CFD to facilitate a precise transient analysis. Combining the two simulations provides a powerful framework to accurately predict building performance parameters. The review examines the variables exchanged between the two simulations and establishes that the Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient (CHTC) as the most important exchanged variable that can significantly improve the accuracy of energy simulations. Issues regarding the application of co-simulation mechanism are then discussed in terms of simulation discontinuities, along with strategies adopted by researchers to overcome the same. In the later sections, the review evaluates the applicability of co-simulation from the perspective of year-long building energy simulations and presents an overview of methods used in research to implement the same. Finally, the conclusions are discussed and the scope for future research in the field is presented. Practical implication: The review presents a critical analysis of essentially all major coupling strategies that can be used to perform a BES-CFD coupled analysis along with their strengths, limitations and possible application scenarios. Additionally, the problems associated with establishing the co-simulation are examined and various adopted solutions are presented along with methods implemented towards extending the practical applicability of such an analysis to encapsulate year-long simulations.

N2 - Humans make sense of the world through narratives. Therefore, adversaries often use conflict-sustaining narratives to maintain dominance and delegitimize the actions of the rivals. To better understand narratives’ role and influence in such intractable conflicts, a computational framework and methodology are introduced. The computational cognitive model and its underlying inference mechanism allow analysts to simulate and analyze narratives in relation to opposing narratives. The ability to simulate the interaction of adversarial stories with a set of micronarratives shared by members of a group opens new avenues to counter conflict-sustaining narratives. The methodology and its application to a concrete conflict scenario demonstrate how to conduct simulation-driven exploratory analysis over a complex adaptive narrative space to discern how narratives are matched to unfolding events and how they can be used to facilitate favorable change.

N2 - Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been widely adopted to identify the Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the construction industry and determine its high environmental impact through Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, energy and resource consumptions. The consideration of LCA in the early stages of design is becoming increasingly important as a means to avoid costly changes at later stages of the project. However, typical LCA-based tools demand very detailed information about structural and material systems and thus become too laborious for designers in the conceptual stages, where such specifications are still loosely defined. In response, this paper presents a workflow for LCA-based evaluation where the selection of the construction system and material is kept open to compare the impacts of alternative design variants. We achieve this through a strict division into support and infill systems and a simplified visualization of a schematic floor layout using a shoebox approach, inspired from the energy modelling domain. The shoeboxes in our case are repeatable modules within a schematic floor plan layout, whose enclosures are defined by parametric 2D surfaces representing total ratios of permanent supports versus infill components. Thus, the assembly of modular surface enclosures simplifies the LCA evaluation process by avoiding the need to accurately specify the physical properties of each building component across the floor plan. The presented workflow facilitates the selection of alternative structural systems and materials for their comparison, and outputs the Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the form of an intuitive visualization output. The workflow for simplified evaluation is illustrated through a case study that compares the GWP for selected combinations of material choice and construction systems.

N2 - This article is set within a technological paradigm shift that denotes a transition from hardware to software and that, by means of applications and operating systems, plays a central role in the sociocultural sphere, intervening in the creation, classification and distribution of cultural objects. The aim of this research is to delve into how the graphical user interface (GUI) integrates into contemporary audiovisual discourse, focusing on its potential as a spatial metaphor. To that end, a theoretical framework is built on the concept of space as a tool and its instrumentalization in the GUI throughout the years, with a view to design a taxonomy in relation to the different ways in which the GUI integrates into digital image composition. The article concludes that the ability to operate in the virtual and physical space, moving between the logic of the tool and its potential as spatial metaphor, provides the GUI with the necessary specificity to be considered a key cultural element for analysing new media’s visual identity.

N2 - Purpose This study investigated the impact of the variant angulations on the values and distribution of wall shear stress on the renal branches and the mating vessels of a pivotal fenestrated design. Methods An idealized endograft model of two renal branches was computationally reconstructed with variable angulations of the left renal branch. These ranged from the 1:30’ to 3:30’ o’clock position, corresponding from 45° to 105° with increments of 15°. A fluid-structure-interaction analysis was performed to estimate the wall shear stress. Results The proximal part of the renal branch preserved quite constant wall shear stress. The transition zone between its distal end and the renal artery showed the highest values compared to the proximal and middle segments, ranging from 8.9 to 12.4 Pa. The lowest stress values presented at 90° whereas the highest at 45°. The post-mating arterial segment showed constantly low stress values regardless of the pivotal branch angle (6.3 to 6.6 Pa). The 45° configuration showed a distribution of the highest stress posteriorly whereas the 105°-angulation anteriorly. Conclusions The variant horizontal branch orientation influences the wall shear stress distribution across its length and affects its values only at its transition with the mating vessel. These findings and their potential association with adverse effects deserve further clinical validation.

N2 - Abstract The paper reviews experimental and computational research directed at improving the internal cooling of gas-turbine blades. While not the most glamorous area of gas-turbine aerothermodynamics, the improvements in overall thermal efficiency directly attributable to internal blade cooling arguably outstrip those achieved in any other area of jet-engine research. The cooling arrangements within a blade adopt three cooling strategies: impinging leading-edge jets, serpentine passages for the mid-blade section, and pin fins near the trailing edge. Progress in each of these areas is examined. Although, in the second of these areas, CFD studies have now become an essential weapon in the designer’s armoury, the other two still rely mostly on experimental research. Possible further developments are discussed.

N2 - A multi-objective optimization framework is developed for design of submarine hull shape. Internal volume of the vehicle and its hydrodynamic drag are optimized by seamlessly integrating non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm and Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes solver in a single code. The methodology seeks a geometric shape with minimum drag and maximum volume satisfying the constraints on the geometric design parameters given by a 5-parameter formula that describes the submarine hull. The shape of the sail is not a part of the optimization process, and only its longitudinal location over the submarine hull is optimized. Two design optimization approaches are proposed, solved and compared. In the first approach, the combined hull–sail location is optimized, and in the second, the hull shape without sail is optimized first, and for this optimized hull shape, the sail location is optimized next. Our reported results show that the former approach yields significantly lower drag.

N2 - This study presents a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to simulate the three-dimensional airflow in the trachea before and after the vascular ring surgery (VRS). The simulation was based on CT-scan images of the patients with the vascular ring diseases. The surface geometry of the tracheal airway was reconstructed using triangular mesh by the Amira software package. The unstructured tetrahedral volume meshes were generated by the ANSYS ICEM CFD software package. The airflow in the tracheal airway was solved by the ESI CFD-ACE+ software package. Numerical simulation shows that the pressure drops across the tracheal stenosis before and after the surgery were 0.1789 and 0.0967 Pa, respectively, with the inspiratory inlet velocity 0.1 m/s. Meanwhile, the improvement percentage by the surgery was 45.95%. In the expiratory phase, by contrast, the improvement percentage was 40.65%. When the inspiratory velocity reached 1 m/s, the pressure drop became 4.988~Pa and the improvement percentage was 43.32%. Simulation results further show that after treatment the pressure drop in the tracheal airway was significantly decreased, especially for low inspiratory and expiratory velocities. The CFD method can be applied to quantify the airway pressure alteration and to evaluate the treatment outcome of the vascular ring surgery under different respiratory velocities.

N2 - Infrared radiation signatures of gas turbine engine exhaust are suppressed markedly when equipped with a serpentine nozzle compared to an axisymmetric nozzle. The aim of this paper is to research more detailed flow characteristics of the serpentine nozzle, and to this end a double serpentine nozzle cold fluid test was conducted in this paper, static pressures on the nozzle walls surface were measured, and schlieren flow visualizations downstream of the nozzle exit were observed. Then numerical simulations of the experimental model were carried out using CFD software with k-ɛ turbulence model adopted. And the effects of geometric design parameters (the length ratio of first S length to second S length and the centerline distributions) on serpentine nozzle performance were investigated numerically. Detailed flow characteristics were presented including the distributions of static pressure, Ma number (streamlines), wall shear stress (limited streamlines), and the total pressure. Results show good agreement between the experimental data and computation. Static pressure distributions on the upper and down walls surface of double serpentine nozzle are completely different compared to the traditional axisymmetric nozzle. The rapid turning and steep passage slope of the serpentine nozzle would result in high friction loss and strong secondary flow loss, hence the value of the length ratio of first S passage to second S passage is recommended to be chosen from 2:5 to 2:3. The centerline distributions are crucial to the nozzle design for its influence on air acceleration inside the nozzle. The centerlines with a rapid turning at the exit would result in a high Ma number, which brings on high friction loss and secondary loss at the turnings. For maximum efficiency of centerline distributions, it is recommended that curves with a gentle turning at each serpentine passage exit should be chosen.

N2 - Different domains of software applications require that the project management’s development process be customized to its specific conditions and needs. One of the most widely used operation research is the development of a scientific software product. Numerous studies point to a wide gap among the various communities, processes, dynamics, etc., between the development of general software products and the development of computational scientific software products. This wide gap emphasizes the necessity for more suitable and more adjustable practices in project management and in the development of scientific software products. One of the most significant challenges in the development of scientific software is expressed in the different attitudes and expectations held by various stakeholders, in terms of the scope, objectives, and goals they envision for their software product. Although unique challenges in the development of scientific software arise at every stage of the process, we maintain that, by addressing the varying perspectives gap at the very outset of the project management process, one can reduce unwanted dynamics throughout the development process. A “project charter” is a critical formal statement that defines the scope, objectives and participants in a project in order to officially authorize the project and to ensure that everyone involved is aware of its purpose and objectives. Customization of the project charter can provide a response to the varying perspectives gap. This paper presents an approach to the generation of a customized project charter for scientific software products as an initial and essential step for the achievement of quality. We will demonstrate the implementation of the approach in one of our own scientific software development projects – a simulation software product used for the development of a fiber optic evanescent wave spectroscopy (FEWS) simulator.

N2 - In this work, a mean-line model with the row-by-row stacking scheme is developed to simulate the off-design operation of a multi-stage transonic axial compressor of an industrial gas turbine. A database of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results validated with the field data is generated at different rotating speeds and pressure ratios by using CFD simulation tools and available detail geometry of the studied compressor. The compressor characteristic parameters including inlet/exit blockage factor, deviation angle parameter, rotor temperature and pressure coefficients, and the pressure loss of the stator for all stages, plus variable inlet guide vane, are extracted from CFD simulation results. Based on analytical/empirical relations in the literature, a generic formulation for the characteristic parameters is defined as a function of airflow parameters such as inlet Mach number, inlet flow angle, and velocity ratio. Since the accuracy of this type of model depends on the formulated characteristic parameters, and due to the error propagation potential of the sequential stacking solutions, a multi-objective optimization program is developed to specify the coefficients and exponent values of the generic formulations. The functionality of characteristic curves versus airflow parameters for different compressor rows is comprehensively investigated. The comparison between the results of the mean-line model and CFD simulations shows the high accuracy of the model. The developed model can be used in applications such as condition monitoring of in-service gas turbines, studying the effects of rescheduling the variable stator vanes, and investigating the wet compression process.

N2 - Self-expanding stents made of Nitinol, a Nickel–Titanium shape memory alloy, are used in standard medical implants for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Despite the increasing success, clinical studies have reported stent failure after the deployment in the human body, thus undermining patient’s safety and life. This study aims to fill the gap of reliable assessment of the fatigue life of Nitinol stents. We propose a global computational design method for preclinical validation of Nitinol stents, which can be extended to patient-specific computations. The proposed methodology is composed of a mechanical finite element analysis and a fatigue analysis. The latter analysis is based on a novel multiaxial fatigue criterion of the Dang Van type, combining the shakedown response of the stent and the complexity of phase transformation taking place within the material. The method is implemented in the case of a carotid artery stent. The implant configuration as well as the applied cyclic loading are shown to affect material phase evolution as well as stent lifetime. The comparison with the results obtained by applying a strain-based constant-life diagram approach allows to critically discuss both fatigue criteria and to provide useful recommendations about their applicability.

N2 - Abstract A computational model of the pregnant occupant, which is capable of simulating the dynamic response to acceleration impacts, is introduced. The occupant model represents a 5th percentile female at around the 38th week of pregnancy. A finite element uterus and multi-body fetus is integrated into an existing female model to incorporate pregnant female anthropometry. The complete model, ‘Expecting’, is used to simulate a range of frontal impacts of increasing severity from 15km/h to 45km/h. Three levels of occupant restraint, completely unrestrained, three-point seat belt, and three-point seat belt with an airbag, are investigated. The strains developed in the uterus because of loading from the seat belt and steering-wheel unit are presented, together with an analysis of stress distribution due to inertial loading of the fetus on the uterus. The unrestrained cases are shown to be the most dangerous to the fetus, owing to the large interaction with the vehicle steering wheel at the level of the placenta. The use of a three-point seat belt together with a driver airbag appears to offer the greatest protection to the fetus.

N2 - This article presents computational algorithms for the design, analysis, and optimization of airfoil aerodynamic performance. The prescribed surface curvature distribution blade design (CIRCLE) method is applied to a symmetrical airfoil NACA0012 and a non-symmetrical airfoil E387 to remove their surface curvature and slope-of-curvature discontinuities. Computational fluid dynamics analysis is used to investigate the effects of curvature distribution on aerodynamic performance of the original and modified airfoils. An inviscid–viscid interaction scheme is introduced to predict the positions of laminar separation bubbles. The results are compared with experimental data obtained from tests on the original airfoil geometry. The computed aerodynamic advantages of the modified airfoils are analyzed in different operating conditions. The leading edge singularity of NACA0012 is removed and it is shown that the surface curvature discontinuity affects aerodynamic performance near the stalling angle of attack. The discontinuous slope-of-curvature distribution of E387 results in a larger laminar separation bubble at lower angles of attack and lower Reynolds numbers. It also affects the inherent performance of the airfoil at higher Reynolds numbers. It is shown that at relatively high angles of attack, a continuous slope-of-curvature distribution reduces the skin friction by suppressing both laminar and turbulent separation, and by delaying laminar-turbulent transition. It is concluded that the surface curvature distribution has significant effects on the boundary layer behavior and consequently an improved curvature distribution will lead to higher aerodynamic efficiency.

N2 - The paper presents a review of existing literature in the field of coupling Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with Building Energy Simulations (BES) to better predict indoor environmental conditions and building energy implications. CFD is capable of providing a detailed analysis of airflow profile and temperature gradients in the space as well as better prediction of heat transfer involving convection and radiation. Whereas BES can provide dynamically changing boundary conditions to CFD to facilitate a precise transient analysis. Combining the two simulations provides a powerful framework to accurately predict building performance parameters. The review examines the variables exchanged between the two simulations and establishes that the Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient (CHTC) as the most important exchanged variable that can significantly improve the accuracy of energy simulations. Issues regarding the application of co-simulation mechanism are then discussed in terms of simulation discontinuities, along with strategies adopted by researchers to overcome the same. In the later sections, the review evaluates the applicability of co-simulation from the perspective of year-long building energy simulations and presents an overview of methods used in research to implement the same. Finally, the conclusions are discussed and the scope for future research in the field is presented. Practical implication: The review presents a critical analysis of essentially all major coupling strategies that can be used to perform a BES-CFD coupled analysis along with their strengths, limitations and possible application scenarios. Additionally, the problems associated with establishing the co-simulation are examined and various adopted solutions are presented along with methods implemented towards extending the practical applicability of such an analysis to encapsulate year-long simulations.

N2 - Infrared radiation signatures of gas turbine engine exhaust are suppressed markedly when equipped with a serpentine nozzle compared to an axisymmetric nozzle. The aim of this paper is to research more detailed flow characteristics of the serpentine nozzle, and to this end a double serpentine nozzle cold fluid test was conducted in this paper, static pressures on the nozzle walls surface were measured, and schlieren flow visualizations downstream of the nozzle exit were observed. Then numerical simulations of the experimental model were carried out using CFD software with k-ɛ turbulence model adopted. And the effects of geometric design parameters (the length ratio of first S length to second S length and the centerline distributions) on serpentine nozzle performance were investigated numerically. Detailed flow characteristics were presented including the distributions of static pressure, Ma number (streamlines), wall shear stress (limited streamlines), and the total pressure. Results show good agreement between the experimental data and computation. Static pressure distributions on the upper and down walls surface of double serpentine nozzle are completely different compared to the traditional axisymmetric nozzle. The rapid turning and steep passage slope of the serpentine nozzle would result in high friction loss and strong secondary flow loss, hence the value of the length ratio of first S passage to second S passage is recommended to be chosen from 2:5 to 2:3. The centerline distributions are crucial to the nozzle design for its influence on air acceleration inside the nozzle. The centerlines with a rapid turning at the exit would result in a high Ma number, which brings on high friction loss and secondary loss at the turnings. For maximum efficiency of centerline distributions, it is recommended that curves with a gentle turning at each serpentine passage exit should be chosen.

N2 - In this research, computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the effect of in-cylinder flow motion on the in-cylinder conditions and spark ignition–controlled auto-ignition hybrid combustion. It is proved in this study that asymmetric intake valve events could be used to generate the swirl-dominated flow motion. However, the macroscopic flows, such as the swirl and tumble, show very weak correlations with zone-to-zone conditions and hybrid combustion process. The detailed investigation on the in-cylinder zone-to-zone conditions indicates that the in-cylinder turbulent kinetic energy level and the mean flow velocity (Vm) around the spark plug would directly affect the early flame propagation process, which in turn affect the subsequent auto-ignition process through changing the heat transfer between central burned gas and end-gas. In addition, the increased temperature inhomogeneity of the spherical zones caused by the in-cylinder flow motion would prolong the auto-ignition combustion. The structures of the flame front and auto-ignition sites also demonstrate the significant impact of in-cylinder motion on the combustion process. It is found that the combustion mode transition is very sensitive to the in-cylinder turbulent kinetic energy, Vm, and temperature and its inhomogeneity, indicating that these flow and thermal conditions could be used to optimize the hybrid combustion mode operation. It also proves the fluctuations of the in-cylinder flow, and thermal conditions could be the reasons leading to significant cycle-to-cycle variations in spark ignition–controlled auto-ignition hybrid combustion.

N2 - This article discusses interaction between multimodal representations of architectural design knowledge, particularly focusing on relating explicit and implicit types of information. The aim of the presented research is to develop a computational environment that combines several modes of representation, including and integrating different forms of architectural design knowledge. Development of an interactive digital-models library and ontological model of architectural design factors are discussed, which are complementary in nature. In a time when BIM software is seen as embodiment of domain knowledge and the future medium of architectural design, this paper presents an interaction between ontological representation of architectural design knowledge and its embodiment in interactive models, thus focusing on the process of design and design space exploration. In the digital environments that we propose, representation of different formats of knowledge, such as visual, linguistic or numeric, are integrated with relational and procedural information, design rules, and characteristics. Interactive search and query based on contextual constraints, and parametric variation of the model based on the information received from ontology are the underlying drivers for design exploration and development.

N2 - The efficient global optimization method is a global optimization technique that can select the next sample point automatically by infill sampling criteria and search for the global minimum with less samples than the conventional global optimization needs. Infill sampling criteria function consists of the predictor and mean square error provided from the kriging model, which is a stochastic metamodel. Also, the constrained efficient global optimization method can minimize the objective function when dealing with constraints under the efficient global optimization concept. In this study, the constrained efficient global optimization method was applied to the RAE2822 airfoil shape design formulated with constraint. But the noisy computational fluid dynamics data caused the kriging model to fail to depict the true function. The distorted kriging model would make the efficient global optimization deviate from the correct search. This distortion of kriging model can be handled with the interpolation (p = free) kriging model. With the interpolation (p = free) kriging model, however, the search for efficient global optimization solution was stalled in a narrow feasible region, so there were less chances to update the objective and constraint functions. Then the accuracy of the efficient global optimization solution may not be good enough, so the three-step search method is proposed to obtain an accurate global minimum as well as prevent the distortion of kriging model for the noisy constrained computational fluid dynamics problem.

N2 - Hospitals are plagued with a multitude of logistical challenges amplified by a time-sensitive and high intensity environment. These conditions have resulted in burnout among both doctors and nurses as they work tirelessly to provide critical care to patients in need. We propose a new machine-learning-powered matching mechanism that manages the surgeon-nurse-patient assignment process in an efficient way that saves time and energy for hospitals, enabling them to focus almost entirely on delivering effective care. Through this design, we show how incorporating artificial intelligence into management systems enables teams of all sizes to meaningfully coordinate in highly chaotic and complex environments.

N2 - Accumulation of soot particles on the wall of a constricted pipe, through which JP4 liquid jet fuel flows, is investigated numerically, using a pipe with a bump on its wall. The effects of particle size, particle-to-fluid density ratio and carrier fluid flow Reynolds number, on particle accumulation, are investigated. When the particles’ size is relatively large, with particle-to-fluid density ratio greater than unity, and at relatively large Re number, the largest accumulation of particles occurs near the bump’s front wall where those particles are blocked by the protruding bump and are too massive to be carried away by the nearwall, low momentum carrier fluid. Conversely, when either the particles’ size or the carrier fluid Re number is relatively small, or the density ratio is less than unity, the largest accumulation of particles occurs in one of three regions: on the bump’s rear wall, near the center of the recirculation eddy, or at the flow detachment point. Particle-accumulation ratio on the bump’s wall decreases monotonically as the particle size decreases (with the mass concentration of particles at the pipe inlet held fixed).

N2 - Heat transfer is a significant factor affecting internal combustion engine efficiency, emissions and performance. This study concentrates on model development for convective heat transfer and near-wall turbulent flow. The solution of complete fluid dynamics equations within the very thin-wall boundary layers is, and will be in the near future, very impractical in engineering scale flows with any present day method. An advanced numerical near-wall treatment method within the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes framework has been developed. The method solves simplified boundary layer equations for enthalpy, momentum, turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation in wall adjacent cells on cellwise high-resolution subgrids, adaptive to local conditions. The boundary layer equations include temperature gradient–induced density/multicomponent material property variations and complete imbalance contributions, for example, convection, transients, pressure gradient and external sources, in compact forms. The resulting numerical wall functions are valid with near-wall grid resolution ranging from the viscous sublayer to the fully turbulent region, thus avoiding the conflicting near wall resolution requirements of common low–Reynolds and high–Reynolds number turbulence models. The advanced near wall treatment method, comprising the numerical imbalance wall functions and accordingly modified low–Reynolds number turbulence model, is implemented in STAR-CD 4.12, extensively utilized in engine simulations. The near wall treatment method is validated against available measurements and direct numerical simulation data of strongly heated pipe flow. Performance of the near-wall treatment method in engine conjugate heat transfer simulations is also demonstrated. Local and average effects of variable properties and imbalance contributions on piston surface heat transfer, friction and turbulent sources are elaborated and contrasted to the standard high–Reynolds number near-wall treatment.

N2 - A detailed prediction of injection and air–fuel mixing is fundamental in modern direct injection, spark-ignition engines to guarantee a stable and efficient combustion process and to minimize pollutant formation. Within this context, computational fluid dynamics simulations nowadays represent a powerful tool to understand the in-cylinder evolution of spray and air–fuel charge. To guarantee the accuracy of the adopted multidimensional spray sub-models, it is mandatory to validate the computed results against available experimental data under well-defined operating conditions. To this end, in this work, the authors proposed the calibration and validation of a comprehensive set of spray sub-models by means of the simulation of the Spray G experiment, available in the context of the engine combustion network. For a suitable validation of the proposed numerical setup in addition to the baseline condition, gasoline direct injection operating points typical of early injection with homogeneous operation, late injection with high ambient density and flash boiling with enhanced fuel evaporation were also simulated. Numerical computations were validated against a wide set of available experimental data by means of an accurate post-processing analysis taking into account axial liquid and vapor penetrations, gas-phase velocity between spray plumes, droplet size, plume liquid velocity, direction and mass distribution. Satisfactory results were achieved with the proposed setup, which is able to predict gasoline spray evolution under different operating conditions.

N2 - While information technology has facilitated the collection of neverbefore-seen quantities of data, these data have not always provided the information needed by transportation professionals to support sound decision making. Computational intelligence (CI) has great potential to support the needs of transportation professionals. CI is a result of synergy among information processing technologies such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), fuzzy sets, and genetic algorithms. As the number of CI applications to transportation problems grows, so does the need to evaluate these systems. The issue of validating and evaluating transportation CI applications is addressed. A case study that evaluates the effectiveness of two CI paradigms, case-based reasoning and ANNs, for estimating the benefits of real-time traffic diversion is presented. The case study illustrates the need for regarding validation and evaluation as a part of the development effort and the need for tuning the design parameters of CI paradigms.

N2 - Ducted fuel injection (DFI) is an innovative method that curtails or prevents soot formation in direct-injection compression-ignition engines. DFI uses a simple duct, positioned outside each injector hole, facilitating the fuel/charge gas mixing before ignition. This reduces the equivalence ratio below two, in the autoignition zone, which in turn decreases soot formation. But this method also reduces fuel-conversion efficiency. This study investigates the effects of DFI on in-cylinder heat transfer. Experiments with conventional diesel combustion (CDC) and DFI were performed at four different dilution levels. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were carried out at conditions matching those of the experiments, and the simulations were validated by the experimental data. The CFD simulations enabled to examine of in-cylinder heat release and temperature distributions. The heat transfer to the piston, head, and cylinder was investigated. The results show that DFI increased the heat transfer to the walls compared to CDC under the same conditions. This could help explain why DFI has been observed to reduce fuel-conversion efficiency by approximately 1% (absolute) relative to CDC under certain conditions. The efficiency loss typically decreases with dilution, such that DFI can improve fuel-conversion efficiencies relative to CDC at higher dilution levels.

N2 - This study investigated the computational cost associated with grammatical planning in sentence production. We measured people’s pupillary responses as they produced spoken descriptions of depicted events. We manipulated the syntactic structure of the target by training subjects to use different types of sentences following a colour cue. The results showed higher increase in pupil size for the production of passive and object dislocated sentences than for active canonical subject–verb–object sentences, indicating that more cognitive effort is associated with more complex noncanonical thematic order. We also manipulated the time at which the cue that triggered structure-building processes was presented. Differential increase in pupil diameter for more complex sentences was shown to rise earlier as the colour cue was presented earlier, suggesting that the observed pupillary changes are due to differential demands in relatively independent structure-building processes during grammatical planning. Task-evoked pupillary responses provide a reliable measure to study the cognitive processes involved in sentence production.

N2 - It has been hypothesized that known words in the lexicon strengthen newly formed representations of novel words, resulting in words with dense neighborhoods being learned more quickly than words with sparse neighborhoods. Tests of this hypothesis in a connectionist network showed that words with dense neighborhoods were learned better than words with sparse neighborhoods when the network was exposed to the words all at once (Experiment 1), or gradually over time, like human word-learners (Experiment 2). This pattern was also observed despite variation in the availability of processing resources in the networks (Experiment 3). A learning advantage for words with sparse neighborhoods was observed only when the network was initially exposed to words with sparse neighborhoods and exposed to dense neighborhoods later in training (Experiment 4). The benefits of computational experiments for increasing our understanding of language processes and for the treatment of language processing disorders are discussed.

N2 - The analysis of fluid flow near the wellbore region of a hydrocarbon reservoir is a complex phenomenon. The pressure drop and flow rates change in the near wellbore with time, and the understanding of this system is important. Besides existing theoretical and experimental approaches, computational fluid dynamics studies can help understanding the nature of fluid flow from a reservoir into the wellbore. In this research, a near wellbore model using three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations is presented for analyzing the flow around the wellbore. Pressure and velocity are coupled into a single system which is solved by an algebraic multigrid method for the optimal computational cost. The computational fluid dynamics model is verified against the analytical solution of the Darcy model for reservoir flow, as well as against the analytical solution of pressure diffusivity equation. The streamlines indicate that the flow is radially symmetric with respect to the vertical plane as expected. The present computational fluid dynamics investigation observes that the motion of reservoir fluid becomes nonlinear at the region of near wellbore. Moreover, this nonlinear behavior has an influence on the hydrocarbon recovery. The flow performance through wellbore is analyzed using the inflow performance relations curve for the steady-state and time-dependent solution. Finally, the investigation suggests that the Navier–Stokes equations along with a near-optimal solver provide an efficient computational fluid dynamics framework for analyzing fluid flow in a wellbore and its surrounding region.

N2 - Block-based programming languages (BBLs) have been proposed as a way to prepare students for learning to program in more sophisticated, text-based languages, such as Java. Hybrid BBLs add the ability to view and edit the block commands in auto-generated, text-based code. We compared the use of a non-hybrid BBL (Scratch), a hybrid BBL (Pencil Code), and no BBL across three sections of an introductory CS course that taught Java programming, to determine whether either type of BBL offered cognitive or affective advantages for learning Java. Students in the BBL groups were surveyed about their perceptions of each BBL in terms of ease of use and helpfulness in learning Java, and all three groups were compared on their performance in Java programming. The results showed that, in this introductory CS course, neither type of BBL offered an advantage in preparing students for learning Java. These results held regardless of the students’ level of Java knowledge prior to the course.

N2 - Inspired by the life cycle and survival of the fittest and combined with the consideration of living space information, a new computational intelligence approach, namely, living space evolution (LSE), is presented. LSE has reflected two new ideas. One is living space evolution: under the guidance of living space information, the offspring of life concentrate and evolve continuously towards richer living spaces. The other is multiple offspring reproduction: simulating real life in nature, a life can reproduce multiple offspring within one generation. In this work, LSE dynamic model, its flow, and pseudocodes are described in detail. A digital simulation has shown the procedure of LSE living space evolution. Furthermore, two applications of using LSE are employed to demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability. One is to apply it to the optimization for continuous functions, and the other is to use it as an optimization tool for routing protocol in wireless sensor network that is a discrete problem in real world. Research has shown that LSE is effective for the optimization for the continuous functions and also applicable for the discrete problem in real world. In addition, LSE has a special ability to balance search process from exploration to exploitation gradually.

N2 - The overflow energy loss in relief valve, which is one of the main reasons leading to the low efficiency of the hydraulic system, had been considered to be impossible to solve. The principle of the overflow energy loss of the relief valve is analyzed and a novel method to reduce the overflow loss using an energy recovery unit, which can improve the return line pressure of the pilot proportional relief valve, is proposed. The influence of the energy recovery unit on the pressure control characteristics and steady-state flow force of the pilot proportional relief valve are discussed. The effects of the return line pressure on the distribution of the flow field and the pressure control characteristics are analyzed through computational fluid dynamics simulation and experiment. The results show that with the increase of the return line pressure, the displacement of the main valve spool increases and the reset spring force increases accordingly. While the steady-state flow force decreases dramatically with the increase of the return line pressure, which results in a smaller pressure differential the pressure differential can be reduced from 15% to 2.5%. It is also observed that the flow rate of the pilot proportional relief valve can be maintained at a certain value with a small oscillation and that the pilot proportional relief valve can release the redundant flow of hydraulic system. This verifies that the pilot proportional relief valve with the outlet connecting to the energy recovery unit to recovery the overflow energy loss cannot reduce the pressure control characteristics, but can achieve a better pressure control accuracy of the pilot proportional relief valve.

N2 - The co-optimization of in-cylinder combustion and after-treatment technology has become a major aspect in engine design and development, with the goal of meeting the increasingly restrictive emission regulations in the transportation industry. Selective Catalytic Reduction is a robust technology to control the emission of NOx, and the injection of urea in water solution is the exhaust tailpipe is a key aspect of its operation. The proposed work uses high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics to characterize the atomization dynamics of the liquid jet in relevant cross-flow conditions. The study focuses on a commercial low-pressure (9 bar) pressure-swirl injector which is characterized in its internal geometry through high-resolution X-ray micro-computational tomography. The internal two-phase flow has been modeled according to the volume-of-fluid approach in a large eddy simulation framework and validated against near-nozzle X-ray radiography measurement. Moreover, characterizing the breakup dynamics for the swirling hollow cone formation, and assessing the influence of the cross-flow in the breakup dynamics was completed. The results have been reported proposing Re-Oh maps and probability density functions of the spray kinematics. Higher cross-flow momentum generates an increase in the jet intact length and a reduction of the liquid droplet diameters. The axial momentum of the jet is affected by the cross-flow already in the near-nozzle region, determining a relevant deviation of the spray velocities. This work aims to inform the initialization of Eulerian-Lagrangian spray models through the assignment of droplet kinematics and static one-way coupling between volume-of-fluid results and Lagrangian spray parcels, to be used for system-size domain simulations.

N2 - In a new theory of conflict escalation, Randall Collins engages critical issues of violent conflict and presents a compellingly plausible theoretical description based on his extensive empirical research. He also sets a new challenge for sociology: explaining the time dynamics of social interaction. However, despite heavy reliance on the quantitative concept of positive feedback loops in his theory, Collins presents no mathematical specification of the dynamic relationships among his variables. This article seeks to fill that gap by offering a computational model that can parsimoniously account for many features of Collins’s theory. My model uses perceptual control theory to create an agent-based computational model of the time dynamics of conflict. With greater conceptual clarity and more wide-ranging generalizability, my alternative model opens the door to further advances in theory development by revealing dynamic aspects of conflict escalation not found in Collins’s model.

N2 - This article reports five studies in which a scale for assessing teachers’ beliefs about classroom use of critical-thinking (CT) activities was developed and its scores evaluated for reliability and validity. The Critical Thinking Belief Appraisal (CTBA) is based on a four-factor “advantage effect” model: the theoretical premise that teachers’ CT-related decision making is associated with their beliefs about the effectiveness of (a) high-CT activities for high-advantage learners, (b) high-CT activities for low-advantage learners, (c) low-CT activities for high-advantage learners, and (d) low-CT activities for low-advantage learners. Results indicated that the scale produced scores with high reliability; a stable factor structure; and satisfactory discriminant, construct, and predictive validity. The studies supported the theoretical and practical utility of the construct and measure of teachers’ beliefs about classroom use of CT activities.

N2 - Objectives: In the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment, the emergence of therapeutic failures with existing antiretroviral drugs presents a significant challenge. This study aims to employ advanced molecular modeling techniques to identify potential alternatives to current antiretroviral agents. Methods: The study focuses on three essential classes of antiretroviral drugs: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs). Computational analyses were performed on a database of 3,343,652 chemical molecules to evaluate their binding affinities, pharmacokinetic properties, and interactions with viral reverse transcriptase and protease enzymes. Molecular docking, virtual screening, and 3D pharmacophore modeling were utilized to identify promising candidates. Results: Molecular docking revealed compounds with high binding energies and strong interactions at the active sites of target enzymes. Virtual screening narrowed down potential candidates with favorable pharmacological profiles. 3D pharmacophore modeling identified crucial structural features for effective binding. Overall, two molecules for class 1, 7 molecules for class 2, and 2 molecules for class 3 were selected. These compounds exhibited robust binding affinities, interactions with target enzymes, and improved pharmacokinetic properties, showing promise for more effective HIV treatments in cases of therapeutic failures. Conclusion: The combination of molecular docking, virtual screening, and 3D pharmacophore modeling yielded lead compounds that hold potential for addressing HIV therapeutic failures. Further experimental investigations are essential to validate the efficacy and safety of these compounds, with the ultimate goal of advancing toward clinical applications in HIV management.

N2 - This paper studies the law of the Lie algebras associated with a particular type of Lie groups: the Lie groups formed by all the upper-triangular matrices without zeros in their main diagonal. Indeed, these laws are obtained by means of a computational algorithm which we have constructed and particularly implemented by using the symbolic computation package MAPLE. Besides, the complexity of this algorithm is studied by considering the number of computations carried out with this implementation.

N2 - A composite material (CM) of periodic structure with the peristatic properties of constituents, as proposed by Silling, is analyzed by a generalization of the classical locally elastic computational homogenization to its peristatic counterpart. New volumetric periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) are introduced at the interaction boundary of a representative unit cell (UC). A generalization of the Hill’s equality to peristatic composites is proved. The general results establishing the links between the effective moduli and the corresponding mechanical influence functions are obtained. The discretization of the equilibrium equation acts as a macro-to-micro transition of the deformation-driven type, where the overall deformation is controlled. Determination of the microstructural displacements allows one to estimate the peristatic traction at the geometrical UC’s boundary, which is exploited for estimation of the macroscopic stresses and the effective moduli. The proposed approach is demonstrated computationally through one-dimensional examples.

N2 - This systematic literature review presents the computational methods of human behaviour prediction research from Pentland and Liu’s seminal 1999 paper on human behaviour prediction to the latest research to date. The PRISMA framework for systematic reviews was used as the review methodology to structure this information aggregation. This review provides a high-level summary of the field with key areas identified for new research. The results show that there are frequently used datasets for training predictive models: MavHome, MavLab, LIARA, CASAS, PlaceLab, and REDD. Accuracies in the range of 43.9% to 100% for predictions of varying complexity. Common data structures for modelling behavioural data: Vectors, tables, trees, Markov models, and graphs. Algorithms that fall into three distinct categories: Machine Learning (NN, RL, LSTM), Probabilistic Graphical Models (namely Bayesian and Markov variants), and Statistical and Trend Analysis (ARIMA, Prophet). Additionally, we document other notably useful algorithms that fall outside of these three main categories including Jaro-Winkler and Levenshtein distances. Opportunities identified for further research include the use of audio as the data source for behaviour prediction methods, and applying times-series prediction machine learning algorithms (RNN, LSTM) to the smart home problem space.

N2 - We address the problem of DOA estimation in positioning of nodes in wireless sensor networks. The Stochastic Maximum Likelihood (SML) algorithm is adopted in this paper. The SML algorithm is well-known for its high resolution of DOA estimation. However, its computational complexity is very high because multidimensional nonlinear optimization problem is usually involved. To reduce the computational complexity of SML estimation, we do the following work. (1) We point out the problems of conventional SML criterion and explain why and how these problems happen. (2) A local AM search method is proposed which could be used to find the local solution near/around the initial value. (3) We propose an algorithm which uses the local AM search method together with the estimation of DML or MUSIC as initial value to find the solution of SML. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. In particular, the algorithm which uses the local AM method and estimation of MUSIC as initial value has much higher resolution and comparable computational complexity to MUSIC.

N2 - This study investigates how collective corruption appears, using a computational method. Specifically, acknowledging that the characteristics of collective corruption process are analogous to percolation phenomena, we illuminate that collective corruption is formed by ongoing social interactions in an organizational boundary. By formulating a percolation-based system dynamics model, we consider the behavioral characteristics of collective corruption in terms of individuals’ corruption preferences governed by personal attributes on corruption. We also propose and examine scenarios regarding the formation of collective corruption.

N2 - In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics trimming method is proposed and compared with wind tunnel experiment and the blade element method. The NASA’s generic ROBIN helicopter model is adopted for transient simulations to obtain the final main rotor trimming conditions. Totally three steps were applied to the computational fluid dynamics method. The first step is associated with no cyclic pitch motion, the second is regarding pure longitudinal cyclic pitch motion and the last is concerning with pure lateral cyclic pitch motion. At the same time, a simple linear equation system between the roll and pitching moment was established to get the final longitudinal and lateral cyclic pitch angles for the main rotor through the above three steps. An overset grid approach was used where the volume around each blade was modeled in an individual overset grid region. The rotor rotation was resolved with three degrees per time-step. Turbulence was modeled with the well-known SST K-omega model with second-order convection. The helicopter was in straight forward flight with an advance ratio of . Three sources of stick angles, which are also called rotor trimming angles, were shown and compared with each other. And the corresponding results were also plotted with a type of history plot in the computational fluid dynamics condition. In the simulations, the results became quasi periodic after about 1.5 rotations and four rotor rotations were simulated for each case. The pitch moment coefficient and roll moment coefficient were all trimmed to about zero by the computational fluid dynamics trimming method while moments were not removed thoroughly in the other two source conditions.

N2 - Gain modulation is a nonlinear way in which neurons combine information from two (or more) sources, which may be of sensory, motor, or cognitive origin. Gain modulation is revealed when one input, the modulatory one, affects the gain or the sensitivity of the neuron to the other input, without modifying its selectivity or receptive field properties. This type of modulatory interaction is important for two reasons. First, it is an extremely widespread integration mechanism; it is found in a plethora of cortical areas and in some subcortical structures as well, and as a consequence it seems to play an important role in a striking variety of functions, including eye and limb movements, navigation, spatial perception, attentional processing, and object recognition. Second, there is a theoretical foundation indicating that gain-modulated neurons may serve as a basis for a general class of computations, namely, coordinate transformations and the generation of invariant responses, which indeed may underlie all the brain functions just mentioned. This article describes the relationships between computational models, the physiological properties of a variety of gain-modulated neurons, and some of the behavioral consequences of damage to gain-modulated neural representations.

N2 - The blood pump is an implantable device with strict performance requirements. Any effective structural improvement will help to improve the treatment of patients. However, the research of blood pump structure improvement is a complex optimization problem with multiple parameters and objectives. This study takes the splitter blade as the object of structural improvement. Computational fluid mechanics and neural networks are combined in research and optimization. And hydraulic experiments and micro particle image velocimetry technology were used. In the optimization study, the number of blades, axial length and circumferential offset are optimization parameters, and hydraulic performance and hemolytic prediction index are optimization targets. The study analyzes the influence of each parameter on performance and completes the optimization of the parameters. In the results, the optimal parameters of number of blades, axial length ratio, and circumferential offset are 2.6° and 0.41°, respectively. Under optimized parameters, hydraulic performance can be significantly improved. And the results of hemolysis prediction and micro particle image velocimetry experiments reflect that there is no increase in the risk of hemolytic damage. The results of this study provide a method and ideas for improving the structure of the axial spiral blade blood pump. The established optimization method can be effectively applied to the design and research of axial spiral blade blood pumps with complex, high precision, and multiple parameters and targets.

N2 - We report on our experiences in building a computational environment for tomographic image analysis for marine seismologists studying the structure and evolution of mid- ocean ridge volcanism. The computational environment is determined by an evolving set of requirements for this problem domain and includes needs for high performance parallel computing, large data analysis, model visualiza tion, and computation interaction and control. Although these needs are not unique in scientific computing, the integration of techniques for seismic tomography with tools for parallel computing and data analysis into a com putational environment was (and continues to be) an interesting, important learning experience for researchers in both disciplines. For the geologists, the use of the environment led to fundamental geologic discoveries on the East Pacific Rise, the improvement of parallel ray-trac ing algorithms, and a better regard for the use of compu tational steering in aiding model convergence. The com puter scientists received valuable feedback on the use of programming, analysis, and visualization tools in the en vironment. In particular, the tools for parallel program data query (DAQV) and visualization programming (Viz) were demonstrated to be highly adaptable to the problem do main. We discuss the requirements and the components of the environment in detail. Both accomplishments and limitations of our work are presented.

N2 - This paper examines the prevalence of bias in artificial intelligence text-to-image models utilized in the architecture and design disciplines. The rapid pace of advancements in machine learning technologies, particularly in text-to-image generators, has significantly increased over the past year, making these tools more accessible to the design community. Accordingly, this paper aims to critically document and analyze the collective, computational, and cognitive biases that designers may encounter when working with these tools at this time. The paper delves into three hierarchical levels of operation and investigates the possible biases present at each level. Starting with the training data for large language models (LLM), the paper explores how these models may create biases privileging English-language users and perspectives. The paper subsequently investigates the digital materiality of models and how their weights generate specific aesthetic results. Finally, the report concludes by examining user biases through their prompt and image selections and the potential for platforms to perpetuate these biases through the application of user data during training.

N2 - The conventional rotor spinning unit generates flow vortices in the transfer channel upstream region which affect the fiber configuration and consequently yarn properties. Geometry and spinning parameters such as transfer channel length, inlet width, rotor outlet pressure, opening roller speed, and diameter were found to be key parameters influencing airflow characteristics. To reduce the flow vortices in the upper stream region, modifications of the transfer channel were proposed, and their airflow fields were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. Three designs were studied: a round transfer channel inlet, a bypass channel for extra air supply, and one with both the bypass and the round inlet. Analysis of airflow revealed that the design with both round transfer channel inlet and a bypass proved to be very effective in properly directing the flow and minimizing vortices. The design was also characterized by smoother velocity streamlines and maximum mass flow across the transfer channel. A conventional rotor spinning unit was modified in which a round transfer channel inlet corner and a bypass channel were utilized to conduct the experimental tests. Three sets of yarn samples were produced using the conventional and modified rotor spinning units under different rotor speed conditions. Yarn properties were tested. Properties such as tenacity, CVm%, and thin and thick places of the spun yarns produced by the new design improved compared to that of the conventional yarn.

N2 - Purpose A-v anastomosis entails dramatic changes in hemodynamic conditions, which may lead to major alterations to the vessels involved; primarily dilatations and devastating stenoses. Wall shear stress is thought to play a key role in the remodeling of the vessels exposed to abnormal levels and oscillating wall shear stress. In this study we sought to develop a framework suitable for thorough in vivo analyses of wall shear stress and vessel morphology of a-v fistulas in patients. Methods Using ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) transverse image stacks from six patient a-v fistulas were obtained. From the image stacks three-dimensional geometries of the patient fistulas were created using dedicated segmentation software. Geometries of three a-v fistulas were imported into Finite Element software in order to perform fluid flow simulations of blood flows and frictional forces on the vessel walls in the a-v fistulas. Boundary conditions for the simulations were obtained using both a MRI Phase Contrast and an Ultrasound Doppler technique. Results The segmentation of the six fistulas of very different age and morphology (two end-to-side and four side-to-side) showed the ability of the approach to create geometries of various fistula morphologies. Simulations of the three fistulas showed an instant picture of the present status of the exposure to different levels of wall shear stress and the morphological status in the vessel remodeling process. Conclusion The study demonstrated the capability of the CFD framework to analyze patient a-v fistulas on a regular basis using both MRI and ultrasound-based approaches.

N2 - Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based automated depression diagnosis systems have been suggested for early and accurate detection of mood disorders. EEG signals are highly irregular, nonlinear, and nonstationary in nature and are traditionally studied from a linear viewpoint by means of statistical and frequency features. Since, linear metrics present certain limitations and nonlinear methods have proven to be an efficient tool in understanding the complexities of the brain in the identification of underlying behavior of biological signals, such as electrocardiogram, EEG and magnetoencephalogram and thus, can be applied to all nonstationary signals. Various nonlinear algorithms can be used in the analysis of EEG signals. In this research paper, we aim to develop a novel methodology for EEG-based depression diagnosis utilizing 2 advanced computational techniques: frequency-domain extended multivariate autoregressive (eMVAR) and deep learning (DL). We proposed a hybrid method comprising a pretrained ResNet-50 and long-short term memory (LSTM) to capture depression-specific information and compared with a strong conventional machine learning (ML) framework having eMVAR connectivity features. The following 8 causality measures, which interpret the interaction mechanisms among spectrally decomposed oscillations, were used to extract features from multivariate EEG time series: directed coherence (DC), directed transfer function (DTF), partial DC (PDC), generalized PDC (gPDC), extended DC (eDC), delayed DC (dDC), extended PDC (ePDC), and delayed PDC (dPDC). The classification accuracies were 84% with DC, 85% with DTF, 95.3% with PDC, 95.1% with gPDC, 84.8% with eDC, 84.6% with dDC, 84.2% with ePDC, and 95.9% with dPDC for the eMVAR framework. Through a DL framework (ResNet-50 + LSTM), the classification accuracy was achieved as 90.22%. The results demonstrate that our DL methodology is a competitive alternative to the strong feature extraction-based ML methods in depression classification.

N2 - The political landscape in Bangladesh is complex and multifaceted, with limited exploration in relation to the rapidly growing news industry. This study aims to address this gap by analyzing 15,801 news articles, utilizing trend analysis and topic modeling. The findings reveal a consistent decline in political news coverage, with sporadic increases during parliamentary election years. The dominant focus of news topics revolves around the two major political parties, the Awami League (AL) and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), indicating the country’s two-party-centric nature of politics. Smaller political parties receive media coverage primarily when they form coalitions with major parties, further highlighting the dominance of the two major parties in political news coverage. The study also uncovers a preference for individual political figures over incidents or events in news coverage, suggesting a patron-client relationship within major political parties and a hierarchical decision-making system. In addition, the study identifies shifts in news framing during significant events, such as national elections, indicating changes in person-centric news frames, but always involving one of the two major political parties. Finally, the study highlights and raises important questions about potential political control over media and journalistic activities, stimulating discourse on journalistic freedom and political free speech.

N2 - Abstract This article addresses two modelling aspects of wind turbine aerofoil aerodyna-mics based on the solution of the Reynolds-averaged Navier—Stokes (RANS) equations. One of these is the effect of an a priori method for structured grid adaptation aimed at improving the wake resolution. The presented results emphasize that the proposed adaptation strategy greatly improves the wake resolution in the far field, whereas the wake is completely diffused by the non-adapted grid with the same number and spacing patterns of grid nodes. The proposed adaptation approach can be easily included in the structured generation process of both commercial and in-house-structured mesh generators. The other numerical aspect examined herein is the impact of particular choices for turbulence modelling on the predicted solution. This includes the comparative analysis of numerical solutions obtained by using different turbulence models, and also aims at quantifying the solution inaccuracy arising from not modelling the laminar-to-turbulent transition. It is found that the drag forces obtained by considering the flow as transitional or fully turbulent may differ by 50 per cent. All these issues are investigated using a special-purpose hyperbolic grid generator and two multi block structured finite volume RANS codes. The numerical experiments consider the flow field past a wind turbine aerofoil for which an exhaustive campaign of steady and unsteady experimental measurements was conducted. The predictive capabilities of the CFD solvers are validated by comparing experimental data and numerical predictions for selected flow regimes. The incompressible analysis and design code XFOIL is also used to support the findings of the comparative analysis of numerical RANS-based results and experimental data.

N2 - Background: Redox active metal cations, such as Cu2 +, have been related to induce amyloid plaques formation and oxidative stress, which are two of the key events in the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and others metal promoted neurodegenerative diseases. In these oxidative events, standard reduction potential (SRP) is an important property especially relevant in the reactive oxygen species formation. Objective: The SRP is not usually considered for the selection of drug candidates in anti-AD treatments. In this work, we present a computational protocol for the selection of multifunctional ligands with suitable metal chelating, pharmacokinetics, and redox properties. Methods: The filtering process is based on quantum chemical calculations and the use of in silico tools. Calculations of SRP were performed by using the M06-2X density functional and the isodesmic approach. Then, a virtual screening technique (VS) was used for similar structure search. Results: Protocol application allowed the assessment of chelating, drug likeness, and redox properties of copper ligands. Those molecules showing the best features were selected as molecular scaffolds for a VS procedure in order to obtain related compounds. After applying this process, we present a list of candidates with suitable properties to prevent the redox reactions mediated by copper(II) ion. Conclusion: The protocol incorporates SRP in the filtering stage and can be effectively used to obtain a set of potential drug candidates for AD treatments.

N2 - The ambition and proposal for data modeling of myths presented in this paper is to link contemporary technical affordances to some canonical projects developed in structural anthropology. To articulate the theoretical promise and innovation of this proposal, we present a discrete-event system specification modeling and simulation approach in order to perform a generative analysis and a dynamic visualization of selected narratives, aimed at validating and revitalizing the transformational and morphodynamic theory and methodology proposed by Claude Lévi-Strauss in his structural analysis of myth. After an analysis of Lévi-Strauss’s transformational methodology, we describe in detail how discrete-event system specification models are implemented and developed in the framework of a DEVSimPy software environment. The validation of the method involves a discrete-event system specification simulation based on the extension of discrete-event system specification models dedicated to provide a dynamic Google Earth visualization of the selected myth. Future work around the discrete-event system specification formalism in anthropology is described as well as future applications regarding the impact of computational models (discrete-event system specification formalism, Bayesian inferences, and object-oriented features) to new contemporary anthropological domains.

N2 - The original definition of P systems calls for rules to be applied in a maximally parallel fashion. However, in some cases a sequential model may be a more reasonable assumption. Here we study the computational power of different variants of sequential P systems. Initially we look at cooperative systems operating on symbol objects and without prioritized rules, but which allow membrane dissolution and bounded creation rules. We show that they are equivalent to vector addition systems and, hence, nonuniversal. When these systems are used as language acceptors, they are equivalent to communicating P systems which, in turn, are equivalent to partially blind multicounter machines. In contrast, if such cooperative systems are allowed to create an unbounded number of new membranes (i.e., with unbounded membrane creation rules) during the course of the computation, then they become universal. We then consider systems with prioritized rules operating on symbol objects. We show two types of results: there are sequential P systems that are universal and sequential P systems that are nonuniversal. In particular, both communicating and cooperative P systems are universal, even if restricted to 1-deterministic systems with one membrane. However, the reachability problem for multi-membrane catalytic P systems with prioritized rules is NP-complete and, hence, these systems are nonuniversal.

N2 - Low temperature, highly premixed compression ignition strategies have proven to produce high efficiency and low soot emissions, but struggle to reach high loads within normal operating constraints. Recent research has suggested that a mixed mode combustion strategy using a premixed main heat release followed by a mixing controlled load extension injection can retain the part-load thermal efficiency and emissions reduction potential of premixed compression ignition strategies, while enabling high load operation. However, soot emissions under this type of mixed mode combustion strategy have been shown to be problematic. This work investigates soot formation and mitigation methods using a combination of detailed engine experiments and computational fluid dynamics modeling. A premixed compression ignition combustion event was achieved using a premixed charge of gasoline and n-heptane to control combustion phasing, and a load extension injection of gasoline was added near top dead center. The experiments showed negligible engine out soot under the premixed compression ignition operating conditions (i.e. without the load extension injection). When the load extension injection was added, soot increased by several orders of magnitude. Detailed experiments were used to isolate the effects of injection timing, injection pressure, charge conditions (e.g. air–fuel ratio), and fuel type. Computational fluid dynamics modeling considering polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon chemistry up to pyrene was then used to explain the experimentally observed soot trends. As expected, the soot emission results showed a strong impact of oxygen concentration and injection pressure for injection timings near top dead center; however, as the load extension injection event was delayed beyond the end of the premixed compression ignition heat release, the soot formation decreased and became independent of oxygen concentration. At these conditions, the computational fluid dynamics modeling showed that soot formation is dependent solely on temperature. The results identify a pathway to enable premixed compression ignition load extension, while minimizing soot emissions.

N2 - Contemporary artificial intelligence and algorithmic processes address deep-seated existential challenges and modes of desire. In so doing, they produce computational systems of imagination, an “algorithmic as if” that enables the expression, transformation, and seeming overcoming of existential limitations via technological means. This article elaborates the character of the “algorithmic as if” by focusing on Deep Nostalgia, an online tool that turns personal photographs of the deceased into looped animations which smile, blink, and move, promising to overcome mortality by technologically “resurrecting the dead.” Performing a close-reading of Deep Nostalgia’s technological processes and the public discourse around its 2021 launch, the article highlights its combination of computational learning, forms of visual representation (photography, video, and animation), and distinctive realignments of temporal experience. Together, these frame the “algorithmic as if” as a magical and affective space for realizing impossible longings that are also reflexive encounters with the “limit-situation” of human mortality.

N2 - The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques enables performance predictions of bearing designs to be made when the usual operating assumptions of the Reynolds equation Jail to hold. This paper addresses the application of a full three-dimensional thermohydrodynamic CFD approach to journal bearings. The journal/shaft may extend beyond the bearing length and the rotation effect is accounted for in the thermal transport process. A circumferentially uniform shaft surface temperature is not assumed. Cavitation modelling is based on averaged lubricant/vapour properties and does not set pressures directly, allowing sub-ambient pressures to be predicted. Lubricant inlet grooves are incorporated with conservation of mass and the possibility of backflow. The modelling is validated against published experimental work on fully circumferential, single inlet and two-inlet circular bore bearings. The predicted and experimental results are in general agreement, although the predicted cyclic variation of journal surface temperature is less than the experimental value. However, an assumption in the predictions was of a non-orbiting journal. The techniques developed may, in principle, be extended to the orbiting journal case providing a dynamic cavitation model can be formulated.

N2 - This paper evaluates with numerical computations the respective merits of two competing notions of coalition stability in the standard global public goods model of climate change. To this effect it uses the CWS integrated assessment model. After a reminder of the two game theoretical stability notions involved—core-stability and internal-external stability—and of the CWS model, the former property is shown to hold for the grand coalition if resource transfers of a specific form between countries are introduced. The latter property appears to hold neither for the grand coalition nor for most large coalitions whereas it is verified for most small coalitions in a weak sense that involves transfers. Finally, coalitions, stable in either sense, that perform best in terms of carbon concentration and global welfare are always heterogeneous ones. Therefore, if coalitional stability is taken as an objective, promoting small or homogeneous coalitions is not to be recommended.

N2 - Three-way junctions in folded RNAs have been investigated both experimentally and computationally. The interest in their analysis stems from the fact that they have significantly been found to possess a functional role. In recent work, three-way junctions have been categorized into families depending on the relative lengths of the segments linking the three helices. Here, based on ideas originating from computational geometry, an algorithm is proposed for detecting three-way junctions in data sets of genes that are related to a metabolic pathway of interest. In its current implementation, the algorithm relies on a moving window that performs energy minimization folding predictions, and is demonstrated on a set of genes that are involved in purine metabolism in plants. The pattern matching algorithm can be extended to other organisms and other metabolic cycles of interest in which three-way junctions have been or will be discovered to play an important role. In the test case presented here with, the computational prediction of a three-way junction in Arabidopsis that was speculated to have an interesting functional role is verified experimentally.

N2 - This study, which was reviewed through the Registered Report process, examined the initial efficacy of the Scientific Explorers program (Sci2) on second-grade students’ science achievement. Sci2 is grounded in the growing body of empirical research on science instruction, embedding principles of explicit instruction within a guided inquiry-based design framework. Eighteen second-grade classrooms were randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions. A cluster randomized controlled trial was employed, with 294 students nested within classrooms and classrooms nested within condition. The Sci2 program was implemented for a total of 10 lessons (5 hr) in treatment classrooms, whereas control classrooms provided business-as-usual science instruction. Overall treatment effects were observed on three of four science outcome measures. The reported effects were moderate to large, with effect sizes (Hedges’ g) ranging from 0.48 to 0.94. Moderation analyses indicated that science knowledge at pretest did not moderate Sci2’s effects. Implications for practice and research are discussed.

N2 - This article analyses collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), complex securities that were at the heart of the recent financial crisis. The difficulties of analysing these securities are considered, and it is argued that the increasing complexity of CDOs that repackaged mortgage-backed securities outpaced the returns available to investors, and therefore the resources available to pay for the analysis required to value the securities adequately within the timeframe available. CDOs therefore faced the problem of computational intractability. Such an outcome was, the article argues, inevitable in financial innovation that sought to create ever-higher returns from the fixed returns on a pool of assets. CDOs created what the article labels a lemon-squeezing problem. Implications for regulatory responses to the crisis are briefly explored.

N2 - Reliable and robust computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers are nowadays commonly utilized in the design and analyses of various engineering systems, such as aircraft, turbomachinery, ships, and automotives. Although this has resulted in a drastic decrease of the number of prototype and experimental testing, the use of CFD in the design automation process is still limited. In practice, the geometry parameters that ensure satisfaction of assumed performance requirements are often obtained by repetitive CFD simulations guided by engineering experience. This is a tedious process which does not guarantee optimal results. On the other hand, straightforward automation attempts by employing the CFD solvers directly in the optimization loop are typically impractical, even when using adjoint sensitivity information, because high-fidelity CFD simulations tend to be computationally very expensive. In this paper, we describe a surrogate-based design optimization methodology that shifts the computational burden from the accurate and expensive high-fidelity CFD model to its fast and yet reasonably accurate surrogate. As the surrogate models are computationally much cheaper than the high-fidelity ones, the cost of the design process is greatly reduced. Here, the surrogates are constructed using low-fidelity CFD models and response correction techniques. Application examples, involving the design of axisymmetric hulls in subsonic flow, and airfoils in both subsonic and transonic flows, are presented.

N2 - This mixed-method study introduced an adaptive scaffolding system to support middle school science problem-based learning (PBL) activities. 298 6th-graders were grouped into three conditions, which are the adaptive scaffolding group, the non-adaptive scaffolding group, and a control group that did not receive any scaffoldings. Results showed that problem-solving self-efficacy for students who engaged with the adaptive scaffolding system had improved significantly compared to the other two groups. Moreover, since students were conducting the PBL activity under two modes (online and in-person), the results also showed that students in the online mode gained more science content knowledge compared to their peers in the in-person mode after engaging with the adaptive system. Student interviews revealed that the real-time supports and in-time feedback provided by the adaptive system were the key elements that facilitated their improvements, teacher interviews presented that the adaptive system provided effective assists for teachers to facilitate the PBL activities.

N2 - In the Institute of Thermal Turbomachinery (ITSM) at Stuttgart University, a three-stage model steam turbine was used to study the complex steam flow through the last stages of low pressure steam turbines. The conditions in this test rig were such that condensation occurred after the first stage, so that wet steam was prevalent in the last stage. In order to determine the inlet conditions for the last stage and for the validation of results of a numerical simulation of the condensing steam flow through the model turbine, both steam quality and the droplet size spectrum were measured in front of the stator of the last stage using a miniature combined optical/pneumatic probe. However, while the measured steam quality matched the numerical results quite well, there were considerable differences between the computed and the measured droplet size spectrum. The latter showed considerably larger droplets than predicted by computational fluid dynamics. In this paper, the measurement principle (light extinction) is presented and the inherent limitations for the determination of very small droplets with diameters of less than 0.2 µm are discussed. Issues related to this challenge are the availability of UV-wavelengths and the optical length used for the measurements. The reliability of the inversion algorithm used to analyse the light extinction data is shown by comparison with data from experiments using polystyrene suspensions with known particle size and concentration. Thereafter, the validity of the measurement results is reassessed based on numerical results and data from repeated measurements. It can be shown that the experimental results are reliable, implying that the numerical results suffer from inaccuracies. Apart from modelling issues, one reason for this could be that the inherent unsteadiness in turbine flows is neglected in steady computational fluid dynamics computations.

N2 - Abstract An overview over flamelet modelling for turbulent non-premixed combustion is given. A short review of previous contributions to simulations of direct injection (DI) diesel engine combustion using the representative interactive flamelet concept is presented. A surrogate fuel consisting of 70 per cent (liquid volume) n-decane and 30 per cent α-methyl-naphthalene is experimentally compared to real diesel fuel. The resemblance of their physical and chemical properties is shown to result in very similar combustion and pollutant formation for both fuels. In order to account for variations of the scalar dissipation rate within the computational domain, a method using multiple flamelets, called the Eulerian particle flamelet model, is used. A strategy is described for subdividing the computational domain and assigning the resulting subdomains to different flamelet histories represented by Eulerian marker particles. Experiments conducted with an Audi DI diesel engine and diesel fuel are compared to simulations using the surrogate fuel. The use of multiple flamelets, each having a different history, significantly improves the description of the ignition phase, leading to a better prediction of pressure, heat release and exhaust emissions of soot and NOx. The effect of the number of flamelet particles on the predictions is discussed.

N2 - Two experiments were run to determine how presentation modality and duration influence children’s arithmetic performance and strategy selection. Third and fourth graders were asked to find estimates for two-digit addition problems (e.g., 52 + 39). Children were tested in three conditions: (1) time-unlimited visual, (2) time-limited visual, or (3) time-limited auditory conditions. Moreover, we assessed children’s working-memory updating and arithmetic fluency. Children were told which strategy to use on each problem to assess arithmetic performance while executing strategies, in Experiment 1, and were asked to choose the best strategy of three available strategies to assess strategy selection, in Experiment 2. Presentation modality influenced strategy execution (i.e., children were faster and more accurate in problems under visual than auditory conditions) but only in children with low updating abilities. In contrast, presentation modality had no effect on children’s strategy selection. Presentation duration had an effect on both strategy execution and strategy selection with time-limited presentation leading to a decline in children’s performance. Interestingly, specifically in children with low updating abilities, time-limited presentation led to poorer performance. Hence, efficient updating seemed to compensate for detrimental effects of auditory in comparison to visual and time-limited in comparison to time-unlimited presentation. These findings have important implications for determining conditions under which children execute strategies most efficiently and select the best strategy on each problem most often, as well as for understanding mechanisms underlying strategic behaviour.

N2 - Reliable and robust computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers are nowadays commonly utilized in the design and analyses of various engineering systems, such as aircraft, turbomachinery, ships, and automotives. Although this has resulted in a drastic decrease of the number of prototype and experimental testing, the use of CFD in the design automation process is still limited. In practice, the geometry parameters that ensure satisfaction of assumed performance requirements are often obtained by repetitive CFD simulations guided by engineering experience. This is a tedious process which does not guarantee optimal results. On the other hand, straightforward automation attempts by employing the CFD solvers directly in the optimization loop are typically impractical, even when using adjoint sensitivity information, because high-fidelity CFD simulations tend to be computationally very expensive. In this paper, we describe a surrogate-based design optimization methodology that shifts the computational burden from the accurate and expensive high-fidelity CFD model to its fast and yet reasonably accurate surrogate. As the surrogate models are computationally much cheaper than the high-fidelity ones, the cost of the design process is greatly reduced. Here, the surrogates are constructed using low-fidelity CFD models and response correction techniques. Application examples, involving the design of axisymmetric hulls in subsonic flow, and airfoils in both subsonic and transonic flows, are presented.

N2 - Abstract A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics modelling was carried out to investigate effects of variable valve timing (VVT) and variable valve actuation (VVA) on gas exchange and fuel-air mixing processes in a diesel homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine with early fuel injection. Four VVT or VVA strategies were conducted for this study: first, a negative valve overlap (NVO) strategy with fixed exhaust-valve-opening (EVO) and intake-valve-closing (IVC) timings but variable valve lifts, referred to as the NVO strategy; second, the NVO strategy with fixed valve profiles but variable EVO and IVC timings, referred to as the EVO strategy; third, the NVO strategy with fixed valve lifts and fixed EVO and IVC timings but variable exhaust-valve-closing (EVC) and intake-valve-opening timings, referred to as the EVC strategy; fourth, VVA with just variable valve lifts, referred to as the VMAX strategy. The results indicate that suitable NVO settings will enhance in-cylinder tumble and then increase turbulence intensity before compression end, although the increased NVO has a negative contribution to swirl ratio. It was found that reducing valve lifts alone is not an efficient way to retain the residual gas, but the function of reduced valve lifts will become significantly obvious by combining it with increasing NVO. For the effect of NVO on in-cylinder temperature, longer NVO not only will increase in-cylinder temperature because of the higher residual gas rate but also will improve the in-cylinder temperature homogeneity. On lowering the maximum valve lift or increasing the NVO, the unmixed region of the in-cylinder charge shrinks. The fuel-rich region expands because of the high intake velocity and enhanced turbulence intensity. This is beneficial to the forming of a global homogeneous charge. It has been noted from the current study that, as the droplet distribution may be influenced more by the in-cylinder air motion caused by NVO when the average droplet size is smaller, it is recommended that future studies explore the effects of VVT and VVA on diesel HCCI mixing and combustion with various advanced fuel injection strategies.

N2 - In the Institute of Thermal Turbomachinery (ITSM) at Stuttgart University, a three-stage model steam turbine was used to study the complex steam flow through the last stages of low pressure steam turbines. The conditions in this test rig were such that condensation occurred after the first stage, so that wet steam was prevalent in the last stage. In order to determine the inlet conditions for the last stage and for the validation of results of a numerical simulation of the condensing steam flow through the model turbine, both steam quality and the droplet size spectrum were measured in front of the stator of the last stage using a miniature combined optical/pneumatic probe. However, while the measured steam quality matched the numerical results quite well, there were considerable differences between the computed and the measured droplet size spectrum. The latter showed considerably larger droplets than predicted by computational fluid dynamics. In this paper, the measurement principle (light extinction) is presented and the inherent limitations for the determination of very small droplets with diameters of less than 0.2 µm are discussed. Issues related to this challenge are the availability of UV-wavelengths and the optical length used for the measurements. The reliability of the inversion algorithm used to analyse the light extinction data is shown by comparison with data from experiments using polystyrene suspensions with known particle size and concentration. Thereafter, the validity of the measurement results is reassessed based on numerical results and data from repeated measurements. It can be shown that the experimental results are reliable, implying that the numerical results suffer from inaccuracies. Apart from modelling issues, one reason for this could be that the inherent unsteadiness in turbine flows is neglected in steady computational fluid dynamics computations.

N2 - Fully three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic simulations with detailed combustion chemistry of a turbulent jet ignition system installed in a rapid compression machine are presented. The turbulent jet ignition system is a prechamber-initiated combustion system intended to allow lean-burn combustion in spark ignition internal-combustion engines. In the presented configuration, the turbulent jet ignition prechamber has a volume that is 2% of the volume of the main combustion chamber in the rapid compression machine and is separated from the main chamber by a nozzle containing a single orifice. Four simulations with orifice diameters of 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, 2.0 mm, and 3.0 mm respectively are presented in order to demonstrate the effect of the orifice diameter on the combustion behavior of the turbulent jet ignition process. Data generated by the simulations is shown including combustion chamber pressures, temperature fields, jet velocities and mass fraction burn durations. From the combustion pressure trace, the jet velocity, and other field data, five distinct phases of the turbulent jet ignition process are identified. These phases are called the compression phase, the prechamber combustion initiation phase, the cold jet phase, the hot jet phase, and the flow reversal phase. The four simulations show that the orifice diameter of 1.5 mm provides the fastest ignition and the fastest overall combustion as reflected in the 0–10% and 10–90% mass fraction burn duration data generated. Meanwhile, the simulation for the orifice diameter of 1.0 mm produces the highest jet velocity and has the shortest delay between the spark and the exit of a jet of hot gases into the main chamber but produces a slower burn duration than the simulation for the larger orifice diameter of 1.5 mm. The simulations for orifice diameters of 2.0 mm and 3.0 mm demonstrate that the combustion speed is reduced as the orifice diameter increases above 1.5 mm. Finally, a discussion is given which examines the implications that the results generated have in regard to implementation of the turbulent jet ignition system in an internal-combustion engine.

N2 - Abstract An overview over flamelet modelling for turbulent non-premixed combustion is given. A short review of previous contributions to simulations of direct injection (DI) diesel engine combustion using the representative interactive flamelet concept is presented. A surrogate fuel consisting of 70 per cent (liquid volume) n-decane and 30 per cent α-methyl-naphthalene is experimentally compared to real diesel fuel. The resemblance of their physical and chemical properties is shown to result in very similar combustion and pollutant formation for both fuels. In order to account for variations of the scalar dissipation rate within the computational domain, a method using multiple flamelets, called the Eulerian particle flamelet model, is used. A strategy is described for subdividing the computational domain and assigning the resulting subdomains to different flamelet histories represented by Eulerian marker particles. Experiments conducted with an Audi DI diesel engine and diesel fuel are compared to simulations using the surrogate fuel. The use of multiple flamelets, each having a different history, significantly improves the description of the ignition phase, leading to a better prediction of pressure, heat release and exhaust emissions of soot and NOx. The effect of the number of flamelet particles on the predictions is discussed.

N2 - We study media representations of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In particular, we train models of semantic memory on a large number of news media outlets that published online articles during the course of the election. Based on the structure of word co-occurrence in these media outlets, our models learn semantic representations for the two presidential candidates as well as for widely studied personality traits. We find that models trained on media outlets most read by Clinton voters and media outlets most read by Trump voters differ in the strength of association between the two candidates’ names and trait words pertaining to morality. We observe some differences for trait words pertaining to warmth, but none for trait words pertaining to competence.

N2 - Current theory has divided memory into multiple systems, resulting in a fractionated account of human behaviour. By an alternative perspective, memory is a single system. However, debate over the details of different single-system theories has overshadowed the converging agreement among them, slowing the reunification of memory. Evidence in favour of dividing memory often takes the form of dissociations observed in amnesia, where amnesic patients are impaired on some memory tasks but not others. The dissociations are taken as evidence for separate explicit and implicit memory systems. We argue against this perspective. We simulate two key dissociations between classification and recognition in a computational model of memory, A Theory of Nonanalytic Association. We assume that amnesia reflects a quantitative difference in the quality of encoding. We also present empirical evidence that replicates the dissociations in healthy participants, simulating amnesic behaviour by reducing study time. In both analyses, we successfully reproduce the dissociations. We integrate our computational and empirical successes with the success of alternative models and manipulations and argue that our demonstrations, taken in concert with similar demonstrations with similar models, provide converging evidence for a more general set of single-system analyses that support the conclusion that a wide variety of memory phenomena can be explained by a unified and coherent set of principles.

N2 - Various investigations on open rotor (OR) hovering in-ground effect (IGE) are carried out, but few papers report shrouded rotor (SR) hovering IGE. This paper compares aerodynamic performance and flowfield characteristics of OR and SR hovering IGE by both experimental measurements and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations. Experimental results reveal that in IGE flight, the aerodynamic performance of SR is more sensitive than that of OR. And at constant power, SR offers more thrust than OR at the same ground distance. Ground has a great influence on thrust for OR below 2.2 rotor radius distance, while for SR it shows obvious effect below 1.5 rotor radius distance. It is also shown that normalized aerodynamic coefficients of OR and SR are independent on rotor speed. In addition, for OR the rotor thrust coefficient changes nearly linearly with the logarithmic distance from ground, while for SR it changes nonlinearly. Flowfield analysis by CFD shows that shroud changes the tip flow features and expands the slipstream area of SR. When ground distance gets small, back pressure below the rotor-disk plane increases, which is more obvious for SR than OR. Furthermore, shroud thrust of SR decreases because of tip leakage flow and flow separation.

N2 - Snow-drifting disasters frequently occur in snowy regions with strong winds and can cause traffic interruptions. Cuttings are particularly vulnerable to severe snowdrift disasters, making designing cutting sections in regions prone to drifting snow challenging. To address this issue, a series of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to study the impact of cutting section parameters on snowdrift development in cuttings with varying depths and slopes. Initially, the wind velocity and wall friction velocity were carefully analyzed in the initial state of the cutting. The evolution process of snow distribution in different cuttings was then compared. Furthermore, the influence of parameters on wind velocity development was analyzed. Based on the flow patterns and snow distribution, cuttings involved in drifting snow disasters can be divided into two types, depending on whether there are vortices in the cutting. When the slope gradient changes from 1/1 to 1/2, the flow in the cutting will not separate and reattach, indicating that the critical slope angle for two types of cutting is 27°. As the slope gradient decreases, the leeward drift will move from the area near the crest to the foot of the slope. Increasing the depth of the cutting not only reduces the accumulation of snow on the road surface but also provides scope to improve the safety reserve capacity of the slopes.

N2 - Objectives: This study proposes a computational model to evaluate patient room design layout and features that contribute to patient stability and mitigate the risk of fall. Background: While common fall risk assessment tools in nursing have an acceptable level of sensitivity and specificity, they focus on intrinsic factors and medications, making risk assessment limited in terms of how the physical environment contributes to fall risk. Methods: We use literature to inform a computational model (algorithm) to define the relationship between these factors and the risk of fall. We use a trajectory optimization approach for patient motion prediction. Results: Based on available data, the algorithm includes static factors of lighting, flooring, supportive objects, and bathroom doors and dynamic factors of patient movement. This preliminary model was tested using four room designs as examples of typical room configurations. Results show the capabilities of the proposed model to identify the risk associated with different room layouts and features. Conclusions: This innovative approach to room design evaluation and resulting estimation of patient fall risk show promise as a proactive evidence-based tool to evaluate the relationship of potential fall risk and room design. The development of the model highlights the challenge of heterogeneity in factors and reporting found in the studies of patient falls, which hinder our understanding of the role of the built environment in mitigating risk. A more comprehensive investigation comparing the model with actual patient falls data is needed to further refine model development.

N2 - Abstract Numerical simulation of three-dimensional dynamic stall (DS) of helicopter rotor blades has been undertaken using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on the Navier-Stokes equations. The CFD method has been carefully validated against experimental data before being used to study the topology of the three-dimensional DS vortex and the effects of yaw and rotation on its shape and trajectory. The three-dimensional unsteady viscous computations were found to give a wealth of results at the expense of significant amounts of CPU time. To alleviate this problem and to develop a faster model for the aerodynamic loads encountered during three-dimensional DS, a neural network (NN) was put forward. The NN was trained using both CFD and experimental data and was subsequently used as a method for interpolating DS loads between known states for which CFD data were available. The NN was found to work well for such interpolations, although its capability to extrapolate outside the training envelope was somehow limited. Nevertheless, the NN was found to be a very efficient technique for reconstructing three-dimensional DS and has demonstrated great potential as a method for reducing non-linear aerodynamics to a simple computational model.

N2 - Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is a behavioral science that aims to teach specific and socially relevant behaviors to people with different repertoires. Technology can aid behavior analysis interventions supporting different educational agents (e.g. psychologists, parents, and teachers) as well as patients. In this article, we reviewed how researchers are using technology in ABA interventions with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We present the results obtained from a systematic review of the literature. The purpose was to map the employment of the computational technology in ABA interventions, as well as to discuss the primary technologies used, their benefits, and their limitations. Based on our review, we noticed that technology-based interventions are in the early stages of development. We evidenced it by the methodological limitations in many of the studies we found, and the relatively simplistic nature of many of the technological applications (e.g. inability to customize the software to meet individual learner needs). We also provide suggestions, based on these findings, for how researchers may advance the studies in this area to improve the lives of children with ASD and their families.

N2 - This article presents a computational simulation framework developed to capture the ratcheting response of dented straight pipes. The results are compared against the results obtained from our previously conducted experiments. Ratcheting occurs when a structure is subjected to a primary axial load along with a secondary cyclic load, provided that the applied loads are sufficiently large in magnitude to cause the material to yield. The dented pipes investigated in this study were initially subjected to a monotonic axial compression load, which caused the initiation of small amplitude wrinkles, and were subsequently subjected to an axial cyclic loading regime. A nonlinear finite element analysis, using a combined hardening model, was adopted to model the response of the material during the entire loading regime. The parameters required by the material model were obtained from cyclic tests conducted on representative coupon specimens. The results of the numerical simulations were compared to experimentally obtained data. The results demonstrated that the ratcheting response of dented pipes could be numerically simulated with a reasonable accuracy. The results also revealed that the surface imperfections exerted a very pronounced effect on the ratcheting response of the dented pipes. The computational model was also used to investigate the influence of some key parameters, such as the initial strain level, stress amplitude, mean stress, loading regime, and material hardening properties, on the resulting ratcheting.

N2 - From their common roots in Human Factors Engineering, Human-Centered Design and Cognitive Systems Engineering have drifted into distinct fields over the past three decades, each developing beneficial heuristics, design patterns, and evaluation methods for designing for individuals and teams, respectively. GeoHAI, a clinical decision support application for preventing hospital-acquired infection, has yielded positive results in early usability testing and is expected to test positively in supporting joint activity, which will be measured through the novel implementation of Joint Activity Monitoring . The design and implementation of this application provide a demonstration of the possibilities and necessities to unify the work of Human-Centered Design and Cognitive Systems Engineering when designing technologies that are usable and useful to individuals engaged in joint activity with machine counterparts and other people. We are calling this unified process Joint Activity Design, which supports designing for machines to be good team players.

Using high-content imaging, we can measure changes in biomarker expression, intracellular localization, and cell morphology. Here we present the computational pipeline we have developed to support the analysis and interpretation of arrayed CRISPR screens. This includes evaluating the quality of guide RNA libraries, performing image analysis, evaluating assay results quality, data processing, hit identification, ranking, visualization, and biological interpretation.

N2 - A computational approach is used to find new solitary solutions of some nonlinear partial differential equations of higher order. The usual starting point is a special transformation converting the equation under consideration in its two variables x and t into a nonlinear ordinary differential equation in the single variable ξ. When we consider the method of hyperbolic functions, new distinctive classes of solutions of physical relevance result. The new feature of this paper is the fact that we are able to calculate distinctive classes of solitary solutions which cannot be found in the literature. In other words using this method the solution manifold is augmented by further classes of solution functions. Simultaneously we stress the necessity of such sophisticated methods since a general theory of nonlinear partial differential equations does not exist. Otherwise this paper is a natural completion of our recent results using alternative approaches for calculating soliton-like solutions.

N2 - An aim of human factors research is to have models that allow for the advance design of user-friendly environments. This is still a distant dream because existing models are not yet sufficiently sophisticated. Models in the domain of motor control are a case in point, but recent developments in computational motor control suggest that the gap between the current state of modeling in this area and the desired state is shrinking. To illustrate this point, we review principles of motor control research that any model of motor control must accommodate. Then we describe a model that captures many of the capacities of actors in the everyday world, including the capacity to reach for objects in different ways depending on factors such as the ease with which different joints can rotate, the required speed of movement, and whether obstacles are present. The model relies on the ideas that goal postures are internally specified before movements are generated, that tasks are defined with flexibly ordered constraint hierarchies, and that movements can be shaped according to task demands. Actual or potential applications of this research include designing and testing possible environments where motor components play a key role.

N2 - In this work we exploit a nonmonotonic Description Logic of typicality as a tool for the generation and the exploration of novel creative concepts. Our logic, called TCL, is able to deal with the phenomenon of prototypical concept combination, which has been shown to be problematic to be modelled in formalisms like fuzzy logic. The logic TCL is the result of combining three main ingredients: (i) the logic of typicality , that allows one to describe typical properties of a class by means of a typicality operator, (ii) the distributed semantics of probabilistic Description Logics, that allows one to provide a probability distribution over worlds/scenarios, and (iii) established heuristics used by humans for concept composition coming from the field of cognitive semantics. Our approach could be useful in many applicative scenarios, ranging from video games to the creation of new movie characters.

This article is an effort to contribute to the slowly growing literature concerning the replication of agent-based computational models. We present a replication of Kollman, Miller, and Page’s model of Tiebout sorting. In that model, individual agents with heterogeneous preferences for government policies select among jurisdictions that offer the most satisfactory package of government services. This project makes three contributions to the literature. First, our successful replication provides the research community with a modernized version of that seminal model. Second, we confirm that earlier results with respect to the single jurisdiction setting are highly robust with respect to voter preferences, while the results for multiple jurisdiction settings are more sensitive. Finally, we demonstrate a technique for conducting sensitivity analyses that leverages a high-dimensional experimental design.

N2 - This study illuminates the varied emotional mechanisms underlying consumer response to ads paired with emotionally congruent versus incongruent content in different placement positions. This work expands the media planning literature that has narrowly focused on thematic (in)congruency. Focusing on music videos, Study 1 empirically tests the affect regulation effect on consumer response to ads paired with emotionally incongruent music videos and the affect priming effect in congruent pairings. Furthermore, this study incorporates affective computing algorithms to pair ads with music videos based on emotional (in)congruency to advance the emerging field of computational advertising. The results from two experimental studies demonstrate that consumers prefer the emotional flow from a negative to a positive state when the ad and media context are emotionally incongruent. In the emotional congruency condition, regardless of ad position, the positively valenced ad produces more favorable responses. Study 2 further illuminates the boundary conditions of emotional (in)congruency and ad valence, suggesting that consumers’ preference for positively valenced ads in the affect regulation and affect priming processes is more prominent when consumers are less involved. When involvement level is high, negative ads are rated as more persuasive than positive ones. Involvement level also reduces ad skipping, especially when the ad and the media program are emotionally incongruent.

N2 - The multiclass percentile user equilibrium (MCPUE) problem discussed in this paper assumes that travelers, subject to uncertainty in a transportation network, strive to minimize reserved travel time (also known as the travel time budget) to ensure a probability of arriving at their destinations on time. An MCPUE, defined as an extension of the Wardrop equilibrium in a probabilistic network, is achieved when no travelers, regardless of their preferred on-time arrival probability, can reduce their reserved travel time by unilaterally changing their routes. Efficient numerical procedures for computing the MCPUE are studied in this paper. Specifically, a proposed new gradient projection algorithm avoids path enumeration through a column generation procedure based on a reliable shortest path algorithm. Implementation details of inner iterations, which are critical to the overall efficiency of the algorithm, are also discussed. Numerical experiments are conducted to test the computational performance of the proposed algorithm.

N2 - Abstract Underbonnet simulations are proving to be crucially important within a vehicle development programme, reducing test work and time-to-market. While computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of steady forced flows have been demonstrated to be reliable, studies of transient convective flows in engine compartments are not yet carried out owing to high computing demands and lack of validated work. The present work assesses the practical feasibility of applying the CFD tool at the initial stage of a vehicle development programme for investigating the thermally driven flow in an engine bay under thermal soak. A computation procedure that enables pseudo time-marching CFD simulations to be performed with significantly reduced central processing unit (CPU) time usage is proposed. The methodology was initially tested on simple geometries and then implemented for investigating a simplified half-scale underbonnet compartment. The numerical results are compared with experimental data taken with thermocouples and with particle image velocimetry (PIV). The novel computation methodology is successful in efficiently providing detailed and time-accurate time-dependent thermal and flow predictions. Its application will extend the use of the CFD tool for transient investigations, enabling improvements to the component packaging of engine bays and the refinement of thermal management strategies with reduced need for in-territory testing.

N2 - Genome-wide arrayed CRISPR screening is a powerful method for drug target identification as it enables exploration of the effect of individual gene perturbations using diverse highly multiplexed functional and phenotypic assays. Using high-content imaging, we can measure changes in biomarker expression, intracellular localization, and cell morphology. Here we present the computational pipeline we have developed to support the analysis and interpretation of arrayed CRISPR screens. This includes evaluating the quality of guide RNA libraries, performing image analysis, evaluating assay results quality, data processing, hit identification, ranking, visualization, and biological interpretation.

N2 - Motivated by the change of effective electrical properties grain or phase boundaries, a computational multiscale framework for continua with interfaces at the microscale is proposed. Cohesive-type interfaces are considered at the microscale, such that displacement and electrical potential jumps are accounted for. The governing equations for materials with interfaces under mechanical and electrical loads are provided. Based on these, a computational multiscale formulation is proposed. The coupling between the electrical and mechanical subproblem is established by the constitutive equations at the material interface. In order to investigate deformation-induced property changes at the microscale, the evolution of interface damage is elaborated. The proposed multiscale framework is further examined through various representative boundary value problems so as to identify its key properties.

N2 - A computational approach is used to find new solitary solutions of some nonlinear partial differential equations of higher order. The usual starting point is a special transformation converting the equation under consideration in its two variables x and t into a nonlinear ordinary differential equation in the single variable ξ. When we consider the method of hyperbolic functions, new distinctive classes of solutions of physical relevance result. The new feature of this paper is the fact that we are able to calculate distinctive classes of solitary solutions which cannot be found in the literature. In other words using this method the solution manifold is augmented by further classes of solution functions. Simultaneously we stress the necessity of such sophisticated methods since a general theory of nonlinear partial differential equations does not exist. Otherwise this paper is a natural completion of our recent results using alternative approaches for calculating soliton-like solutions.

This article is an effort to contribute to the slowly growing literature concerning the replication of agent-based computational models. We present a replication of Kollman, Miller, and Page’s model of Tiebout sorting. In that model, individual agents with heterogeneous preferences for government policies select among jurisdictions that offer the most satisfactory package of government services. This project makes three contributions to the literature. First, our successful replication provides the research community with a modernized version of that seminal model. Second, we confirm that earlier results with respect to the single jurisdiction setting are highly robust with respect to voter preferences, while the results for multiple jurisdiction settings are more sensitive. Finally, we demonstrate a technique for conducting sensitivity analyses that leverages a high-dimensional experimental design.

N2 - A sample-methods scales technique, analogous to Thomdike’s procedure for rating handwriting, was used to determine readability levels of eight randomly arrayed paragraphs selected from children’s literature covering the range from grades 1 through 6. Readability levels were arrived at by having judges match the randomly arrayed paragraphs either to a scale constructed for the study from paragraphs taken from children’s literature or to a scale of paragraphs taken from Spache’s Diagnostic Reading Scales. Validity of the technique was established by the chi-square finding that judged versus computed readability levels of the randomly arrayed paragraphs were not significantly different. Moreover, the average readability estimates for the 32 judges deviated less than an average of 1.0 grade levels from their computed readability levels. Comparisons with other simplified readability procedures revealed the technique was more valid than McLaughlin’s computational procedure and as valid as Fry’s graphed estimate for determining readability, but quicker, requiring approximately only two minutes per paragraph to estimate readability level. The paper concludes with discussion of a rationale for the technique’s effectiveness.

N2 - This study illuminates the varied emotional mechanisms underlying consumer response to ads paired with emotionally congruent versus incongruent content in different placement positions. This work expands the media planning literature that has narrowly focused on thematic (in)congruency. Focusing on music videos, Study 1 empirically tests the affect regulation effect on consumer response to ads paired with emotionally incongruent music videos and the affect priming effect in congruent pairings. Furthermore, this study incorporates affective computing algorithms to pair ads with music videos based on emotional (in)congruency to advance the emerging field of computational advertising. The results from two experimental studies demonstrate that consumers prefer the emotional flow from a negative to a positive state when the ad and media context are emotionally incongruent. In the emotional congruency condition, regardless of ad position, the positively valenced ad produces more favorable responses. Study 2 further illuminates the boundary conditions of emotional (in)congruency and ad valence, suggesting that consumers’ preference for positively valenced ads in the affect regulation and affect priming processes is more prominent when consumers are less involved. When involvement level is high, negative ads are rated as more persuasive than positive ones. Involvement level also reduces ad skipping, especially when the ad and the media program are emotionally incongruent.

N2 - This article presents a computational simulation framework developed to capture the ratcheting response of dented straight pipes. The results are compared against the results obtained from our previously conducted experiments. Ratcheting occurs when a structure is subjected to a primary axial load along with a secondary cyclic load, provided that the applied loads are sufficiently large in magnitude to cause the material to yield. The dented pipes investigated in this study were initially subjected to a monotonic axial compression load, which caused the initiation of small amplitude wrinkles, and were subsequently subjected to an axial cyclic loading regime. A nonlinear finite element analysis, using a combined hardening model, was adopted to model the response of the material during the entire loading regime. The parameters required by the material model were obtained from cyclic tests conducted on representative coupon specimens. The results of the numerical simulations were compared to experimentally obtained data. The results demonstrated that the ratcheting response of dented pipes could be numerically simulated with a reasonable accuracy. The results also revealed that the surface imperfections exerted a very pronounced effect on the ratcheting response of the dented pipes. The computational model was also used to investigate the influence of some key parameters, such as the initial strain level, stress amplitude, mean stress, loading regime, and material hardening properties, on the resulting ratcheting.

N2 - A micromechanical model was established based on the fluid dynamics theory. This model could be used to calculate several kinds of data when the asphalt pavement under the influence of traffic loading is in water-saturated condition. The results showed that the maximum pressure inside the effective pore was located at the junction between exit slits and the pore wall. There was a positive correlation between the pressure and the vehicle speed. Therefore, the repeated traffic loading could cause emulsification, shift and even peeling of the asphalt membrane. Moreover, the bigger size of the exit slit is, the higher velocity of the fluid has. The high velocity flow keeps scouring both the exit slit and the lower boundary of pore wall. It will cause a bigger slit. Pressure distribution inside the effective pore is related to the number of the exit slit which connect with the pore. More exit slits means bigger pressure inside the effective pore. In addition, if asphalt membranes at exit slits have micro-cracking, the cumulative damage could appear easily and asphalt membranes could be peeled easily. Finally, a test was conducted so as to obtain the bonding strength and adhesion strength between asphalt and aggregate. Then, we can get accurate damage form and position during the scour process by comparing the numerical simulation results with experiment results.

N2 - Interstitial photodynamic therapy has shown promising results in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancer. In this therapy, systemic administration of a light-sensitive drug is followed by insertion of multiple laser fibers to illuminate the tumor and its margins. Image-based pretreatment planning is employed in order to deliver a sufficient light dose to the complex locally advanced head-and-neck cancer anatomy, in order to meet clinical requirements. Unfortunately, the tumor may deform between pretreatment imaging for the purpose of planning and intraoperative imaging when the plan is executed. Tumor deformation may result from the mechanical forces applied by the light fibers and variation of the patient’s posture. Pretreatment planning is frequently done with the assistance of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in an outpatient suite, while treatment monitoring and control typically uses ultrasound imaging due to considerations of costs and availability in the operation room. This article presents a computational method designed to bridge the gap between the 2 imaging events by taking a tumor geometry, reconstructed during preplanning, and by following the displacement of fiducial markers, which are initially placed during the preplanning procedure. The deformed tumor shape is predicted by solving an inverse problem, seeking for the forces that would have resulted in the corresponding fiducial marker displacements. The computational method is studied on spheres of variable sizes and demonstrated on computed tomography reconstructed locally advanced head and neck cancer model. Results of this study demonstrate an average error of less than 1 mm in predicting the deformed tumor shape, where 1 mm is typically the order of uncertainty in distance measurements using magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography imaging and high-quality ultrasound imaging. This study further demonstrates that the deformed shape can be calculated in a few seconds, making the proposed method clinically relevant.

N2 - From their common roots in Human Factors Engineering, Human-Centered Design and Cognitive Systems Engineering have drifted into distinct fields over the past three decades, each developing beneficial heuristics, design patterns, and evaluation methods for designing for individuals and teams, respectively. GeoHAI, a clinical decision support application for preventing hospital-acquired infection, has yielded positive results in early usability testing and is expected to test positively in supporting joint activity, which will be measured through the novel implementation of Joint Activity Monitoring . The design and implementation of this application provide a demonstration of the possibilities and necessities to unify the work of Human-Centered Design and Cognitive Systems Engineering when designing technologies that are usable and useful to individuals engaged in joint activity with machine counterparts and other people. We are calling this unified process Joint Activity Design, which supports designing for machines to be good team players.

N2 - We present a computational model of learned avoidance behavior in a one-way avoidance experiment. Our model employs the reinforcement learning paradigm and a temporal-difference algorithm to implement both classically conditioned and instrumentally conditioned components. The role of the classically conditioned component is to develop an expectation of future benefit that is a function of the learning system’s state and action. Competition among the instrumentally conditioned components determines the overt behavior generated by the learning system. Our model displays, in simulation, the reduced latency of the avoidance behavior during learning with continuing trials and the resistance to extinction of the avoidance response. These results are consistent with experimentally observed animal behavior. Our model extends the traditional two-process learning mechanism of Mowrer by explicitly defining the mechanisms of proprioceptive feedback, an internal clock, and generalization over the action space.

The purpose of this investigation was to extend the model to both systole and diastole, and to determine what the effect of a previous cardiac cycle was on the next cardiac cycle. The 25.8 cc ventricular volume was reduced by 40% in 0.25 seconds, then increased to the original volume in another 0.25 seconds and then allowed to rest for 0.25 seconds. Runs done with an ejection fraction of 60% showed little variation from one cardiac cycle to another after the third cardiac cycle was completed; the maximum velocity could vary by over 30% between the first and second cardiac cycles. In systole, centerline and cross-sectional velocity vectors greatly increased in magnitude at the aortic outlet. Most of the pressure drop occurred in the top 15% of the heart. The diastolic phase showed complex vortex formation not seen in the systolic contractions; these complex vortices could account for experimentally observed turbulent blood flow fluctuations in the aorta.

N2 - We present a computational model of learned avoidance behavior in a one-way avoidance experiment. Our model employs the reinforcement learning paradigm and a temporal-difference algorithm to implement both classically conditioned and instrumentally conditioned components. The role of the classically conditioned component is to develop an expectation of future benefit that is a function of the learning system’s state and action. Competition among the instrumentally conditioned components determines the overt behavior generated by the learning system. Our model displays, in simulation, the reduced latency of the avoidance behavior during learning with continuing trials and the resistance to extinction of the avoidance response. These results are consistent with experimentally observed animal behavior. Our model extends the traditional two-process learning mechanism of Mowrer by explicitly defining the mechanisms of proprioceptive feedback, an internal clock, and generalization over the action space.

N2 - The two-dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz instability which arises in two immiscible co-currently moving horizontal liquid layers is studied numerically. Two different methods for capturing the free interface movement are applied, namely the volume-of-fluid method and the level-set method. Both methods are very popular and available within commercial computational fluid dynamics tools. The wave is initialized using two different perturbations implemented into the model. As a case study, a system comprising a toluene layer and an aqueous layer is chosen. Numerical results obtained by both methods are in a good agreement with the linear stability theory for small wave amplitudes. The application of both methods is compared and their advantages and drawbacks are highlighted.

N2 - Temporality is an important aspect of political discourse. Politicians and policymakers attempt to construct the past and the future to gain power, legitimize their policies, claim success for themselves and blame others. To make computational analysis of temporality more accessible, we develop a new methodology using a semisupervised machine-learning algorithm called Latent Semantic Scaling. Only with a set of common verbs in the past perfect and future tense as seed words, the algorithm estimates the temporality of all other words. We demonstrate that it can identify temporal orientation of English and German sentences from election manifestos around 60–70% accurately, which is comparable to the results from a recent study based on supervised machine-learning algorithms. We also apply it to Twitter posts by German political parties to reveal temporal orientation of policy issues.

N2 - An effective method to reduce the violent motion behaviour of fast planing vessels in waves may be found in the application of active control devices in conjunction with advanced motion control systems. This study aims to develop a computational tool for the design and optimization of these ride control systems for high speed planing monohulls. Hydrodynamic characteristics of both transom flaps and interceptors are determined by systematic series of model test experiments in the towing tank of the Laboratory of Ship Hydromechanics at the Delft University of Technology. Transom flap results at downward deflection angles are validated with formulations found in literature. In addition, experiments at up angle flap positions have been performed to increase the range of application for motion control purposes. The hydrodynamic performance of the interceptors and transom flaps are compared in order to determine their efficiency. The experimental data was implemented in a nonlinear time domain mathematical model that can predict the seakeeping behaviour of fast monohulls. Simulations demonstrate the improvement in motion behaviour of a fast planing vessel with a ride control system sailing in head waves.

N2 - An aim of human factors research is to have models that allow for the advance design of user-friendly environments. This is still a distant dream because existing models are not yet sufficiently sophisticated. Models in the domain of motor control are a case in point, but recent developments in computational motor control suggest that the gap between the current state of modeling in this area and the desired state is shrinking. To illustrate this point, we review principles of motor control research that any model of motor control must accommodate. Then we describe a model that captures many of the capacities of actors in the everyday world, including the capacity to reach for objects in different ways depending on factors such as the ease with which different joints can rotate, the required speed of movement, and whether obstacles are present. The model relies on the ideas that goal postures are internally specified before movements are generated, that tasks are defined with flexibly ordered constraint hierarchies, and that movements can be shaped according to task demands. Actual or potential applications of this research include designing and testing possible environments where motor components play a key role.

N2 - Recently there has been an increase in the number of researchers who use rational choice models to explain single cases and rare events. Because of the small number of cases under study, these researchers must rely either explicitly or implicitly on counterfactual reasoning. This paper argues that computational methods provide a profitable means of carrying out rigorous counterfactual analysis. The authors advocate robustness analysis as one important part of the counterfactual analysis of formal theories. Specifically, they evaluate the robustness of the behavioral assumptions of two formal models using various heuristic search algorithms and Markov chains. They find that Kuran’s (1989) threshold model of mass protest and Ingberman’s (1985) model of direct-democracy referenda are robust to perturbations in their behavioral assumptions. These findings increase the plausibility of causal claims made by scholars who use these models to explain specific events.

N2 - The purpose of this article is to discuss the use of explicit instruction in the curriculum area of science where non–explicit approaches (e.g., discovery learning) are often used. While there has been a relative paucity of research on explicit instruction in science classrooms, we argue that explicit instruction, particularly when it is embedded within an inquiry approach aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards, has the potential to increase achievement in science for students with LD. Based on previous research, we provide potential ways to implement the five core instructional components of explicit instruction in today’s inquiry–based science classrooms.

N2 - Recognizer P systems with active membranes have proven to be very efficient computing devices, being able to solve NP-complete decision problems in a polynomial time. However such solutions usually exploit many powerful features, such as electrical charges (polarizations) associated to membranes, evolution rules, communication rules, and strong or weak forms of division rules. In this paper we contribute to the study of the computational power of polarizationless recognizer P systems with active membranes. Precisely, we show that such systems are able to solve in polynomial time the NP-complete decision problem 3-SAT by using only dissolution rules and a form of strong division for non-elementary membranes, working in the maximallly parallel way.

N2 - There are particular similarities in how machines learn about the nature of their environment, and how humans learn to process visual stimuli. Machine Learning (ML), more specifically Deep Neural network algorithms rely on expansive image databases and various training methods (supervised, unsupervised) to “make sense” out of the content of an image. Take for example how students of architecture learn to differentiate various architectural styles. Whether this be to differentiate between Gothic, Baroque or Modern Architecture, students are exposed to hundreds, or even thousands of images of the respective styles, while being trained by faculty to be able to differentiate between those styles. A reversal of the process, striving to produce imagery, instead of reading it and understanding its content, allows machine vision techniques to be utilized as a design methodology that profoundly interrogates aspects of agency and authorship in the presence of Artificial Intelligence in architecture design. This notion forms part of a larger conversation on the nature of human ingenuity operating within a posthuman design ecology. The inherent ability of Neural Networks to process large databases opens up the opportunity to sift through the enormous repositories of imagery generated by the architecture discipline through the ages in order to find novel and bespoke solutions to architectural problems. This article strives to demystify the romantic idea of individual artistic design choices in architecture by providing a glimpse under the hood of the inner workings of Neural Network processes, and thus the extent of their ability to inform architectural design. The approach takes cues from the language and methods employed by experts in Deep Learning such as Hallucinations, Dreaming, Style Transfer and Vision. The presented approach is the base for an in-depth exploration of its meaning as a cultural technique within the discipline. Culture in the extent of this article pertains to ideas such as the differentiation between symbolic and material cultures, in which symbols are defined as the common denominator of a specific group of people.1 The understanding and exchange of symbolic values is inherently connected to language and code, which ultimately form the ingrained texture of any form of coded environment, including the coded structure of Neural Networks. A first proof of concept project was devised by the authors in the form of the Robot Garden. What makes the Robot Garden a distinctively novel project is the motion from a purely two dimensional approach to designing with the aid of Neural Networks, to the exploration of 2D to 3D Neural Style Transfer methods in the design process.

This article examines ChatGPT’s potential as a pedagogical tool for the development of historical thinking. For this purpose, we present the analysis of an interactive process around the historical event usually referred to as the Spanish Reconquista (711–1492). Through argumentative interventions, a dialogue is constructed in which the information provided by the AI is questioned, proving its ability to rectify and incorporate elements of historical thinking into its discourse. An ethical and multidisciplinary perspective is needed, which safeguards the responsible and beneficial use of these technologies in the construction and transmission of historical knowledge.

N2 - In this factor-analytic study of imaging and thinking, measures of vivid visual and auditory imaging loaded onto a unitary “vivid imaging” factor, on which no measures of thinking loaded. This first factor-analytic finding, like previous findings of no correlation between vivid imaging and productive thinking, is consistent with Külpe’s classic argument and Kunzendorf’s contemporary argument that visually and auditorily imaged sensations are not building blocks for “spatial” and “temporal” thinking, respectively, but are sensory representations which vivid imagers construct from their imageless thoughts. Moving beyond individual differences in vivid imaging to individual differences in imageless thinking, this factor-analytic study found, in addition, that radically different measures of styles of thought load onto a unitary “heterarchical versus hierarchical thinking” factor. These differing measures of thinking styles instructed research participants to find embedded spatial and temporal patterns, to organize two unstructured data sets into matrices or outlines, and to rank their preferences for 12 competitive events—6 events defined by “how close, “how high,” or “how far” competitors can perform on a heterarchical measure, and 6 events defined by “how well synchronized,” “how long,” or “how fast” competitors can perform on a hierarchical measure. Engineering students in this research exhibited significantly more heterarchical thinking and significantly less hierarchical thinking; management students exhibited significantly less heterarchical thinking and significantly more hierarchical thinking; and male students and female students exhibited, on average, no significant differences in their modes of thinking. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that people’s “imageless thinking” can be characterized in terms of two orthogonal modes of thinking: heterarchical thinking and hierarchical thinking.

N2 - This article proposes a Rayleigh’s quotient–based damage detection algorithm. It aims at efficiently revealing nascent structural changes on a given structure with the capability to differentiate between an actual damage and a change in operational conditions. The first three damage detection levels are targeted: existence, location, and severity. The proposed algorithm is analytically developed from the dynamics theory and the virtual energy principle. Some computational techniques are proposed for carrying out computations, including discretization, integration, derivation, and suitable optimization methods. Field implementation strategies are also considered for the purpose of online damage monitoring. In order to prove the efficiency of this strategy, one experimental and three numerical case studies were conducted. The proposed algorithm successfully detected the damage in all simulated cases and estimated the damage severity with acceptable accuracy. The conclusion is that the proposed algorithm was able to efficiently detect damage appearance in a range of structures for various damage levels and locations, and under different operational conditions.

N2 - We perform a socio-computational interrogation of the google search by image algorithm, a main component of the google search engine. We audit the algorithm by presenting it with more than 40 thousands faces of all ages and more than four races and collecting and analyzing the assigned labels with the appropriate statistical tools. We find that the algorithm reproduces white male patriarchal structures, often simplifying, stereotyping and discriminating females and non-white individuals, while providing more positive descriptions of white men. By drawing from Bourdieu’s theory of cultural reproduction, we link these results to the attitudes of the algorithm’s designers, owners, and the dataset the algorithm was trained on. We further underpin the problematic nature of the algorithm by using the ethnographic practice of studying-up: We show how the algorithm places individuals at the top of the tech industry within the socio-cultural reality that they shaped, many times creating biased representations of them. We claim that the use of social-theoretic frameworks such as the above are able to contribute to improved algorithmic accountability, algorithmic impact assessment and provide additional and more critical depth in algorithmic bias and auditing studies. Based on the analysis, we discuss the scientific and design implications and provide suggestions for alternative ways to design just socio-algorithmic systems.

N2 - The purpose of this article is to optimize the design of a pickup head that removes particles from road surface. A validated computational fluid dynamics model was proposed to evaluate the particle removal performance of the designed pickup head with different inclination angles. The gas-particle flow through the pickup head was modelled using the EulerianLagrangian approach. The realizable k model and the discrete particle model were adopted to simulate gas flow field and solid particle trajectories, respectively. The results indicate that the inclination angle of the rear edge wall and the pressure drop across the pickup head have great impact on the particle removal performance. Both the particle overall removal efficiency and the grade efficiency increase with the increment of inclination angle, and higher pressure drop can pick up more particles from the road surface, but it would induce unnecessary energy consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to design a pickup head with high removal efficiency and low pressure drop. Through simulation, the optimal angle should be 135 for the range of the inclination angle in this study, and pressure drop is about 2400Pa. Furthermore, more information can be acquired for pickup head design.

N2 - Recognizer P systems with active membranes have proven to be very efficient computing devices, being able to solve NP-complete decision problems in a polynomial time. However such solutions usually exploit many powerful features, such as electrical charges (polarizations) associated to membranes, evolution rules, communication rules, and strong or weak forms of division rules. In this paper we contribute to the study of the computational power of polarizationless recognizer P systems with active membranes. Precisely, we show that such systems are able to solve in polynomial time the NP-complete decision problem 3-SAT by using only dissolution rules and a form of strong division for non-elementary membranes, working in the maximallly parallel way.

N2 - A novel adaptive fuzzy control approach with low computational costs is addressed for the longitudinal non-affine model of a generic hypersonic vehicle subject to parametric uncertainties, capable of guaranteeing that altitude and velocity tracking errors exhibit prescribed performance. A new performance function is devised to impose preselected bounds on the transient and steady-state tracking error performance, and then a transformed error is constructed, which converts the original “constrained” system into an equivalent “unconstrained” one for the simplicity of control designs. Furthermore, a simplified fuzzy controller is exploited for the altitude subsystem, eliminating the issue of “explosion of complexity” that is associated with back-stepping control. For the velocity subsystem, a prescribed performance-based proportional–integral controller is utilized. The special contributions of the proposed control strategy are that it can guarantee altitude and velocity tracking errors with desired transient and steady-state performance, and meanwhile the computational load is quite low. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to verify the efficiency of the design.

N2 - In this paper the characteristics and performance are described of a computational process model (CPM) of human way-finding that is based on psychological models of cognition and experimental data on human way-finding. The model comprises two modules, one for representing objectively a suburban environment and the other for representing the cognitive processes involved in navigation. The CPM is employed to simulate and investigate how spatial knowledge that has been acquired and stored is retrieved and processed in order to plan a path to a given goal. The results of the experiments carried out with NAVIGATOR are compared with the results of experiments involving young adults in real environments. We analyze the performance of NAVIGATOR in terms of its ability to find the goal, the amount of time taken to reach a given goal, the differences in performance during way-finding, and the errors in navigation, as a function of several parameters. The parameters are intended to represent key psychological components of human perceptual and cognitive systems and are derived from experimental studies of human way-finding behavior. The main value of this model lies in its use as a device for investigating and understanding human spatial performance, in terms of accurate performance and errors that arise in tasks of way-finding, and the variations among individuals in terms of performance. A set of computational experiments are used to examine the differences in search strategies between ‘individuals’. The effects of various parameters on way-finding performance are analyzed. Errors in way-finding are classified and are compared with Norman’s and Reason’s classification of errors in human performance. The CPM appears to provide a fruitful model for investigating human way-finding behavior.

N2 - The theory of Green’s functions for the wave and Helmholtz equations is examined with particular attention to their use in aeroacoustics for the extrapolation of acoustic wavefields from numerical flow simulations. In a new synthesis that permits straightforward generalization of previously published results, spatial and temporal windowing functions are employed to provide equivalent-source expressions to account for both initial and boundary conditions. Detailed results describe the transformation of both source terms and Green’s functions to take account of uniform subsonic mean flow, and expressions are given for free-field Green’s functions, both with and without flow, in time, frequency and wavenumber domains. A worked example illustrates the non-uniqueness of the Green’s function for a simple one-dimensional bounded problem.

N2 - This paper presents a computationally efficient Bayesian inference framework and its application to infer damage in truss bridges. The novelty of the proposed framework for reducing the computational burden of Bayesian inference of structural damage lies in (a) the revised transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for efficiently drawing statistical samples of damage indexes and (b) the likelihood function in the frequency domain based on modal properties that could be derived from the stochastic subspace identification. Other special features of the proposed framework include (a) explicitly modeling complexities of truss joints for allowing identification of truss joint damage and the assessment of its associated uncertainties and (b) incorporating the structural finite element model into the probabilistic inference computational environment through the program application interface. Those improvements make new contributions to the field of damage identification for truss bridges, leading to the practical application of Bayesian inference of the large amounts of potential damage not only in truss members but also in truss joints. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed framework are illustrated and examined by using numerical simulation of a damaged prototype truss structure. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach has the potential capacity for determining the extent and location of large amounts of truss damage and the probabilistic characteristics. Finally, the limitation of this study and the future research need for practical application of the proposed probabilistic framework are discussed.

N2 - This paper describes a method to tailor computational design algorithms to evaluate human-centric outputs in architectural projects by presenting a case study that evaluates teamwork affordance for primary care clinics. We argue that computational design assessment techniques fall short of evaluating those human experiences that stem from multiple interactions between individuals and the surrounding environment. This research suggests that future computational design algorithms could benefit from incorporating scenario-based methods developed in the field of evidence-based design, in which studies are concerned about improving qualitative goals. Through this case study, we describe the process of prototyping a computational design algorithm based on the Functional Scenario Analysis approach, applying the algorithm to evaluate case studies, visualizing findings, and extracting design strategies based on the analysis results. This method offers a new vision of how computational design can benefit informed decision-making processes and generate design alternatives aligned with a project’s design goals.

N2 - Hydraulic conductivity (k) is critical for designing permeable pavements for safety and environmental reasons. A novel approach for estimating k is through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applied to permeable asphalt (PA). Specimens of PA are examined in this study to evaluate CFD applicability. Tortuosity, effective porosity, pore size distribution, and specific surface area were determined based on three-dimensional specimen structures reconstructed using x-ray tomography analyses. Using CFD, estimates of k were determined and compared with physical measurements and also with the results obtained from the semi-empirical modified Kozeny-Carman model (KCM). The comparison shows that the numerical simulations with CFD can be a reasonable tool for estimating k and for examining transport of water through PA. Within the constraints of this study, results infer that CFD can provide more representative results for low k in comparison with KCM. For higher k, CFD and KCM results were reasonably comparable.

N2 - Advancements in robotic technology are making it increasingly possible to integrate robots into the human workspace in order to improve productivity and decrease worker strain resulting from the performance of repetitive, arduous physical tasks. While new computational methods have significantly enhanced the ability of people and robots to work flexibly together, there has been little study of the ways in which human factors influence the design of these computational techniques. In particular, collaboration with robots presents unique challenges related to the preservation of human situational awareness and the optimization of workload allocation for human teammates while respecting their workflow preferences. We conducted a series of human subject experiments to investigate these human factors, and provide design guidelines for the development of intelligent collaborative robots based on our results.

N2 - This paper aims to investigate how the trade-offs involved in the construction and solution of restrictive master problems for the user equilibrium traffic assignment problem may affect the overall convergence performance of the solution algorithms. Three strategies used to update user equilibrium path sets in path-based algorithms are examined: an origin–destination (O-D)-based strategy that updates the path set for each single O-D pair just before path flows are updated, an origin-based strategy that updates path sets for all O-D pairs associated with the same origin at once, and a simultaneous strategy that updates the path sets for all O-D pairs together. Three recently developed path-based algorithms to update the path sets by using three strategies are implemented for solution of the restrictive master problems. The implementation strategies are tested on medium to large real networks, and their relative performance characteristics are compared. The results show that the construction and update of the restrictive master problems by the different strategies have significant impacts on convergence as well as solution noise. The computational time for convergence under the simultaneous and origin-based strategies is significantly less than that under the O-D-based strategy. In addition, the solution obtained by adoption of the simultaneous strategy exhibits less noise than the other two strategies. These results provide important theoretical and practical insights into solution algorithms for the traffic assignment problem.

N2 - An 18% scale semispan model is used as a platform for examining the efficacy of microphone array processing using synthetic data from numerical simulations. Two hybrid Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes/Large-Eddy-Simulation (RANS/LES) codes coupled with Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings solvers are used to calculate 97 microphone signals at the locations of an array employed in the NASA Langley Research Center 14 × 22 tunnel. Conventional, DAMAS, and CLEAN-SC array processing is applied in an identical fashion to the experimental and computational results for three different configurations involving deploying and retracting the main landing gear and a part-span flap. Despite the short time records of the numerical signals, the beamform maps are able to isolate the noise sources, and the appearance of the DAMAS synthetic array maps is generally better than those from the experimental data. The experimental CLEAN-SC maps are similar in quality to those from the simulations indicating that CLEAN-SC may have less sensitivity to background noise. The spectrum obtained from DAMAS processing of synthetic array data is nearly identical to the spectrum of the center microphone of the array, indicating that for this problem array processing of synthetic data does not improve spectral comparisons with experiment. However, the beamform maps do provide an additional means of comparison that can reveal differences that cannot be ascertained from spectra alone.

N2 - The purpose of this study is to analyse the differences in the combustion process, and pollutants formation (especially soot) due to top-hat and boot injection-rate shapes at one specific high-load point of a single-cylinder small-bore diesel engine using multidimensional engine simulations. The simulations are performed using a response interactive flamelet model with detailed chemical kinetics. A detailed chemistry-based soot model is used for the prediction of soot emissions. The heights of the first and second stages of the boot shape are varied to observe the effect of the injected fuel mass distribution. In addition, results of boot shapes are compared with a trapezoidal (top-hat) shape. A detailed analysis of soot formation and oxidation is also presented for some selected rate shapes. Through computational analysis it is shown that the boot shapes have the potential to decrease combustion-generated noise and to lower emissions at the investigated load point compared to the top-hat shape. Variations in the temporal distribution of the injected fuel mass show that a lower height of the first stage and a higher height of the second stage of the boot shape result in a relatively slower rise of heat release (lower combustion-generated noise) in the early part of combustion and enhanced soot oxidation as a result of higher spray momentum near the end of injection.

N2 - Focus groups were convened in 2005 and 2013 as the first step in successive MPA curriculum review and revision processes. Although the criteria for selecting participants and the questions posed to the groups were similar, the focus groups generated dramatically different perspectives regarding the challenges confronting administrators. An analysis indicates that the differences in focus group perspectives are a reflection of the evolving economic, political and fiscal environments. It also reinforces the need to adopt instructional strategies that cultivate the students’ creative, critical thinking and life-long learning skills. Since anchored learning maximizes the probability of achieving these outcomes, this article provides three examples of implementation.

N2 - This research quantitatively investigates the impact of violence on the propagation of images in social media in the context of political protest. Using a computational approach, we measure the relative violence of a large set of images shared on Twitter during the protests against the G20 summit in Frankfurt am Main in 2017. This allows us to investigate if more violent content is shared more times and faster than less violent content on Twitter, and if different online communities can be characterized by the level of violence of the visual content they share. The results show that the level of violence in an image tweet does not correlate with the number of retweets and mentions it receives that the time to retweet is marginally lower for image tweets containing a high level of violence and that the level of violence in image tweets differs between communities.

N2 - This article highlights the ‘synergistic’ use of experimental fluid dynamics (EFD) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), where the two sets of simulations are performed concurrently and by the same researcher. In particular, examples from the area of ground effect aerodynamics are discussed, where the major facility used was also designed through a combination of CFD and EFD. Three examples are than outlined, to demonstrate the insight that can be obtained from the integration of CFD and EFD studies. The case studies are the study of dimple flow (to enhance aerodynamic performance), the analysis of a Formula-style front wing and wheel, and the study of compressible flow ground effect aerodynamics. In many instances, CFD has been used to not only provide complementary information to an experimental study, but to design the experiments. Laser-based, non-intrusive experimental techniques were used to provide an excellent complement to CFD. The large datasets found from both experimental and numerical simulations have required a new methodology to correlate the information; a new post-processing method has been developed, making use of the kriging and co-kriging estimators, to develop correlations between the often disparate data types.

N2 - We demonstrate a set of software tools designed to facilitate computational cognitive modeling of multitasking performance. The Modifiable Multitasking Environment (ModME) offers a flexible, browser-based platform for creating multitasking experiments. Simplified Interfacing for Modeling Cognition–JavaScript (SIMCog-JS) provides communication between the browser-based experiments in ModME and the Java implementation of the ACT-R cognitive architecture. The baseline configuration of these software packages enables an ACT-R model to perform pilot-like multitasking in the modified Multi-Attribute Task Battery, which is implemented as the baseline task available in ModME. We show how this combination facilitates the development of models for assessing multitasking workload. In this demonstration, we will explain the software packages and allow attendees to interact with system elements, particularly the ModME graphical user interfaces. All software is available open source for attendees to try themselves.

N2 - The practical feasibility is demonstrated of a traffic assignment method, dubbed area-spread assignment, that incorporates information on the spatial relationships between nodes, links, and zone boundaries. Tests of area-spread assignment were performed on networks from Fredericton, New Brunswick, and Racine, Wisconsin. To eliminate the effect of errors from other model steps in the tests, comparisons were made with a detailed network in Fredericton that contained all streets in the city and extremely small zones. The tests indicated that there is a substantial difference between area-spread assignment and a traditional assignment using centroid connectors. Area-spread assignment did a better job of replicating volumes on the detailed network, although computation times were much longer.

N2 - An 18% scale semispan model is used as a platform for examining the efficacy of microphone array processing using synthetic data from numerical simulations. Two hybrid Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes/Large-Eddy-Simulation (RANS/LES) codes coupled with Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings solvers are used to calculate 97 microphone signals at the locations of an array employed in the NASA Langley Research Center 14 × 22 tunnel. Conventional, DAMAS, and CLEAN-SC array processing is applied in an identical fashion to the experimental and computational results for three different configurations involving deploying and retracting the main landing gear and a part-span flap. Despite the short time records of the numerical signals, the beamform maps are able to isolate the noise sources, and the appearance of the DAMAS synthetic array maps is generally better than those from the experimental data. The experimental CLEAN-SC maps are similar in quality to those from the simulations indicating that CLEAN-SC may have less sensitivity to background noise. The spectrum obtained from DAMAS processing of synthetic array data is nearly identical to the spectrum of the center microphone of the array, indicating that for this problem array processing of synthetic data does not improve spectral comparisons with experiment. However, the beamform maps do provide an additional means of comparison that can reveal differences that cannot be ascertained from spectra alone.

N2 - Visual illusions and perceptual grouping phenomena offer an invaluable tool for probing the computational mechanism of low-level visual processing. Some illusions, like the Kanizsa figure, reveal illusory contours that form edges collinear with the inducing stimulus. This kind of illusory contour has been modeled by neural network models by way of cells equipped with elongated spatial receptive fields designed to detect and complete the collinear alignment. There are, however, other illusory groupings which are not so easy to account for in neural network terms. The Ehrenstein illusion exhibits an illusory contour that forms a contour orthogonal to the stimulus instead of collinear with it. Other perceptual grouping effects reveal illusory contours that exhibit a sharp corner or vertex, and still others take the form of vertices defined by the intersection of three, four, or more illusory contours that meet at a point. A direct extension of the collinear completion models to account for these phenomena tends towards a combinatorial explosion, because it would suggest cells with specialized receptive fields configured to perform each of those completion types, each of which would have to be replicated at every location and every orientation across the visual field. These phenomena therefore challenge the adequacy of the neural network approach to account for these diverse perceptual phenomena. I have proposed elsewhere an alternative paradigm of neurocomputation in the harmonic resonance theory (Lehar 1999, see website), whereby pattern recognition and completion are performed by spatial standing waves across the neural substrate. The standing waves perform a computational function analogous to that of the spatial receptive fields of the neural network approach, except that, unlike that paradigm, a single resonance mechanism performs a function equivalent to a whole array of spatial receptive fields of different spatial configurations and of different orientations, and thereby avoids the combinatorial explosion inherent in the older paradigm. The present paper presents the directional harmonic model, a more specific development of the harmonic resonance theory, designed to account for specific perceptual grouping phenomena. Computer simulations of the directional harmonic model show that it can account for collinear contours as observed in the Kanizsa figure, orthogonal contours as seen in the Ehrenstein illusion, and a number of illusory vertex percepts composed of two, three, or more illusory contours that meet in a variety of configurations.

N2 - We demonstrate a set of software tools designed to facilitate computational cognitive modeling of multitasking performance. The Modifiable Multitasking Environment (ModME) offers a flexible, browser-based platform for creating multitasking experiments. Simplified Interfacing for Modeling Cognition–JavaScript (SIMCog-JS) provides communication between the browser-based experiments in ModME and the Java implementation of the ACT-R cognitive architecture. The baseline configuration of these software packages enables an ACT-R model to perform pilot-like multitasking in the modified Multi-Attribute Task Battery, which is implemented as the baseline task available in ModME. We show how this combination facilitates the development of models for assessing multitasking workload. In this demonstration, we will explain the software packages and allow attendees to interact with system elements, particularly the ModME graphical user interfaces. All software is available open source for attendees to try themselves.

N2 - The purpose of this study is to analyse the differences in the combustion process, and pollutants formation (especially soot) due to top-hat and boot injection-rate shapes at one specific high-load point of a single-cylinder small-bore diesel engine using multidimensional engine simulations. The simulations are performed using a response interactive flamelet model with detailed chemical kinetics. A detailed chemistry-based soot model is used for the prediction of soot emissions. The heights of the first and second stages of the boot shape are varied to observe the effect of the injected fuel mass distribution. In addition, results of boot shapes are compared with a trapezoidal (top-hat) shape. A detailed analysis of soot formation and oxidation is also presented for some selected rate shapes. Through computational analysis it is shown that the boot shapes have the potential to decrease combustion-generated noise and to lower emissions at the investigated load point compared to the top-hat shape. Variations in the temporal distribution of the injected fuel mass show that a lower height of the first stage and a higher height of the second stage of the boot shape result in a relatively slower rise of heat release (lower combustion-generated noise) in the early part of combustion and enhanced soot oxidation as a result of higher spray momentum near the end of injection.

N2 - Kinship is a fundamental feature and basis of human societies. We describe a set of computational tools and services, and the logic that underlies these, developed to improve how we understand both the fundamental facts of kinship and how people use kinship as a resource in their lives. Mathematical formalism applied to cultural concepts is more than an exercise in model building, as it provides a way to represent and explore their logical consistency and implications. Not surprisingly, kinship terminologies are particularly amenable to formal representation. Researchers throughout the history of kinship studies have noted the logicality of kinship terminology systems. The logic is explored here through the kin term computations made by users of a terminology when computing the kinship relation one person has to another by referring to a third person for whom each has a kin term relationship. Kinship Algebra Modeler provides a set of tools, services, and an architecture to explore kinship terminologies and their properties in an accessible manner.

N2 - This article highlights the ‘synergistic’ use of experimental fluid dynamics (EFD) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), where the two sets of simulations are performed concurrently and by the same researcher. In particular, examples from the area of ground effect aerodynamics are discussed, where the major facility used was also designed through a combination of CFD and EFD. Three examples are than outlined, to demonstrate the insight that can be obtained from the integration of CFD and EFD studies. The case studies are the study of dimple flow (to enhance aerodynamic performance), the analysis of a Formula-style front wing and wheel, and the study of compressible flow ground effect aerodynamics. In many instances, CFD has been used to not only provide complementary information to an experimental study, but to design the experiments. Laser-based, non-intrusive experimental techniques were used to provide an excellent complement to CFD. The large datasets found from both experimental and numerical simulations have required a new methodology to correlate the information; a new post-processing method has been developed, making use of the kriging and co-kriging estimators, to develop correlations between the often disparate data types.

N2 - The practical feasibility is demonstrated of a traffic assignment method, dubbed area-spread assignment, that incorporates information on the spatial relationships between nodes, links, and zone boundaries. Tests of area-spread assignment were performed on networks from Fredericton, New Brunswick, and Racine, Wisconsin. To eliminate the effect of errors from other model steps in the tests, comparisons were made with a detailed network in Fredericton that contained all streets in the city and extremely small zones. The tests indicated that there is a substantial difference between area-spread assignment and a traditional assignment using centroid connectors. Area-spread assignment did a better job of replicating volumes on the detailed network, although computation times were much longer.

N2 - The purpose of this study is to analyse the differences in the combustion process, and pollutants formation (especially soot) due to top-hat and boot injection-rate shapes at one specific high-load point of a single-cylinder small-bore diesel engine using multidimensional engine simulations. The simulations are performed using a response interactive flamelet model with detailed chemical kinetics. A detailed chemistry-based soot model is used for the prediction of soot emissions. The heights of the first and second stages of the boot shape are varied to observe the effect of the injected fuel mass distribution. In addition, results of boot shapes are compared with a trapezoidal (top-hat) shape. A detailed analysis of soot formation and oxidation is also presented for some selected rate shapes. Through computational analysis it is shown that the boot shapes have the potential to decrease combustion-generated noise and to lower emissions at the investigated load point compared to the top-hat shape. Variations in the temporal distribution of the injected fuel mass show that a lower height of the first stage and a higher height of the second stage of the boot shape result in a relatively slower rise of heat release (lower combustion-generated noise) in the early part of combustion and enhanced soot oxidation as a result of higher spray momentum near the end of injection.

N2 - Kinship is a fundamental feature and basis of human societies. We describe a set of computational tools and services, and the logic that underlies these, developed to improve how we understand both the fundamental facts of kinship and how people use kinship as a resource in their lives. Mathematical formalism applied to cultural concepts is more than an exercise in model building, as it provides a way to represent and explore their logical consistency and implications. Not surprisingly, kinship terminologies are particularly amenable to formal representation. Researchers throughout the history of kinship studies have noted the logicality of kinship terminology systems. The logic is explored here through the kin term computations made by users of a terminology when computing the kinship relation one person has to another by referring to a third person for whom each has a kin term relationship. Kinship Algebra Modeler provides a set of tools, services, and an architecture to explore kinship terminologies and their properties in an accessible manner.

N2 - This article highlights the ‘synergistic’ use of experimental fluid dynamics (EFD) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), where the two sets of simulations are performed concurrently and by the same researcher. In particular, examples from the area of ground effect aerodynamics are discussed, where the major facility used was also designed through a combination of CFD and EFD. Three examples are than outlined, to demonstrate the insight that can be obtained from the integration of CFD and EFD studies. The case studies are the study of dimple flow (to enhance aerodynamic performance), the analysis of a Formula-style front wing and wheel, and the study of compressible flow ground effect aerodynamics. In many instances, CFD has been used to not only provide complementary information to an experimental study, but to design the experiments. Laser-based, non-intrusive experimental techniques were used to provide an excellent complement to CFD. The large datasets found from both experimental and numerical simulations have required a new methodology to correlate the information; a new post-processing method has been developed, making use of the kriging and co-kriging estimators, to develop correlations between the often disparate data types.

N2 - This study examines how the news framing of immigration influences the public’s feelings toward immigrants and their preference for immigration policy in the United States. Unlike prior experimental research that documents the respondents’ immediate reactions to several hand-crafted news frames, this study provides strong empirical evidence for the association between the respondents’ real-world news exposure and their opinion change over time. Combining a computational media content analysis and a two-wave panel survey, the research demonstrates that while exposure to certain frames in the mainstream media would directly lead to public support for a stricter immigration policy, partisan media tend to affect public opinion indirectly by influencing their feelings toward immigrants in opposite directions.

N2 - This paper is the second in a series implementing initial strain–energy-based thermo-elastoviscoplastic isotropic damage–self-healing formulations for bituminous composites to compare the model predictions with experimental measurements. Computational algorithms based on the two-step operator splitting methodology are systematically developed and employed for numerical simulations. The elastic damage self-healing predictor and the viscoplastic corrector coupled with the Arrhenius-type temperature term via the net stress concept in conjunction with the hypothesis of strain equivalence are entirely considered as numerical implementation of the models. Several numerical examples of one-dimensional driver problems are first presented to show the effect of temperature and rest period for healing. Experimental validation of the proposed formulations against monotonic constant–strain test under different temperatures and controlled-strain cyclic tension test is presented. Qualitative and quantitative agreement between experimental results and numerical simulations is also observed. In particular, the softening behavior of the bituminous materials is well predicted for monotonic constant–strain rate test. The viscous damage behavior can be reasonably captured by the proposed damage models with the Arrhenius-type temperature term and the step-by-step computational algorithms.

N2 - Although a wealth of studies on companies’ environmental behavior exists, little is known about the factors with the greatest influence on the evolution of such behavior. Thus, employing empirical data on China and an agent-based simulation model, this study examines the evolution from defensive to preventive environmental behavior. The results show that community support is the most important factor in this process, followed by managers’ environmental awareness and companies’ financial ability. However, financial ability is the most significant factor in the evolution from preventive to enthusiastic environmental behavior, followed by managers’ environmental awareness and community support. Our identification of the most important factors can serve as a basis for decision makers to focus on improving the operational effectiveness of environmental policies.

N2 - Abstract An experimentally validated numerical analysis of reciprocating refrigeration compressors is presented. The finite-volume methodology is adopted to solve the flow field and a one-degree-of-freedom model is used to describe the valve dynamics. The variation of the computation domain, associated with the valve and piston displacements, is taken into account and the time-dependent flow field and the valve dynamics are coupled and solved simultaneously. The three-dimensional formulation considered in the analysis allowed the simulation of actual suction and discharge muffler geometries. Numerical results were validated with reference to experimental data for valve displacement and pressure in the suction and compression chambers obtained in a calorimeter facility. A study was carried out to identify the contributions of mufflers and valves to the compressor thermodynamic losses.

N2 - Calcium silicate hydrate Jennite is a molecular structure commonly accepted as a representation of the complex calcium silicate hydrate gel formed during the hydration of typical Portland cement. In this paper, the behavior of nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite under shear deformation was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Computational samples representing the nanoscale structure of calcium silicate hydrate Jennite were subjected to shear deformation in order to investigate not only their mechanical properties but also their deformation behavior. The simulation results indicated that the nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite under shear deformation displays a linear elastic behavior up to shear stress of approximately 1.0 GPa, and shear deformation of about 0.08 radians, after which point yielding and plastic deformation occurs. The shear modulus determined from the simulations was 11.2 ± 0.7 GPa. The deformation-induced displacements in molecular structures were analyzed dividing the system in regions representing calcium oxide layers. The displacement/deformation of the layers of calcium oxide forming the structure of nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite was analyzed. The non-linear stress–strain behavior in the molecular structure was attributed to a non-linear increase in the displacement due to sliding of the calcium oxide layers on top of each other with higher shearing. These results support the idea that by controlling the chemical reactions, the tailored morphologies can be used to increase the interlinking between the calcium oxide layers, thus minimizing the shearing of the layers and leading to molecular structures that can withstand larger deformation and have improved failure behavior.

N2 - In the present work, effects of nozzle hole size and rail pressure under non-evaporating spray condition are demonstrated. Three single hole injectors with the bore size of 0.101, 0.122, and 0.133 mm are experimented with injection pressures of 140, 45, and 38 MPa respectively to achieve similar injection rate profile. Diesel spray experiments implement Diffused Backlight Illumination Technique where diffused background is obtained for the High Speed Video camera imaging. Experimental results are then validated with computational and analytical studies. The CFD simulation requires the injection rate profile and spray cone angle as a primary input; thus, based on the High Speed Video Camera start of injection frame the 5 kHz Butterworth low-pass frequency filter is applied to the injection rate raw data. While, the spray cone angle is predicted using a simple model obtained from the relationship between the injection velocity, fluctuating velocity at the nozzle exit and total pressure loss factor of the injector. The experimental spray tip penetration of all three injectors is almost identical as the similar injection rate profile is adopted. Although, the mixture characteristics are better for 0.101 mm hole diameter since the smaller hole diameter with highest injection pressure depicts larger spray angle and better atomization. The computational study agrees with experiments qualitatively; however, the quantitative and qualitative agreements are seen in the analytical study.

N2 - A CFD-based assessment and validation of the NREL Phase-VI Sequence-S rotor at seven wind speeds presented here. The ability of a three-dimensional, unstructured, unsteady RANS solver in successfully predicting the wind flow interactions with a rotating, twisted and tapered rotor is described. The uRANS equations were coupled with SST κ-ω turbulence model and a correlation-based Gamma-Theta transition model. The simulations were performed in ANSYS CFX using both Single Reference Frame (SRF) and Multiple Reference Frame (MRF) modelling approaches. A good agreement with measurements is observed at six of seven wind speeds when comparing the integral quantities, the spanwise and chordwise distributions. The only exception is the 10 m/s wind speed case, attributed to the onset of a massive leading edge stall around the mid-span region. It is successfully demonstrated here how uRANS-based CFD computations can be effectively employed in the study of wind turbine rotor aerodynamics.

N2 - Within the context of the growing polarisation and fragmentation of the urban landscape, this paper presents a computational typology applicable to the study of minority communities, both ethnic and religious, which is useful in understanding their spatial distribution and juxtaposition at neighbourhood levels. The typology has been applied to multicultural London with the use of the 2001 Census, in which there were questions on ethnicity and religion. The landscape of religion is found to be more highly segregated in contrast to the landscape of ethnicity. Furthermore, on the basis of a preliminary analysis of indicator variables, minorities seem on aggregate to be in an improved situation given a level of residential segregation, with the exception of residents of segregated Asian-Bangladeshi areas for ethnicity and residents of segregated Muslim areas for religion. This questions the generally held view that segregation in a multicultural society is undesirable per se and suggests that a ‘one size fits all’ government policy towards residential segregation is insufficiently perceptive. The typology introduced here should facilitate a more critically informed approach to multiculturalism and the contemporary city.

N2 - In this article, a typical submersible well pump was investigated to study the effects of inter-stage leakage on the inner flow field and external characteristics. The whole flow field of the model pump with different seal clearances was simulated by computational fluid dynamics software. The inter-stage clearance leakage calculated by numerical simulation was compared with the values obtained by the empirical formula. The pressure values were recorded with the arrangement of monitor points in the inter-stage clearance, inlet region, and outlet region, which aimed to study the effects of the change of inter-stage clearance pressure on the pump performance. Meanwhile, a comparative analysis of numerical simulation and performance test of the pump was conducted further. The results showed that the leakage at the small clearance is close to the value calculated using empirical formula. But when the clearance is large, the discrepancy between the simulation result and empirical value inclines. Comparing the numerical results of three kinds of clearance leakage, we found that the clearance leakage could not be ignored in the simulation since it has a large effect on the prediction of pump efficiency and head.

N2 - Calcium silicate hydrate Jennite is a molecular structure commonly accepted as a representation of the complex calcium silicate hydrate gel formed during the hydration of typical Portland cement. In this paper, the behavior of nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite under shear deformation was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Computational samples representing the nanoscale structure of calcium silicate hydrate Jennite were subjected to shear deformation in order to investigate not only their mechanical properties but also their deformation behavior. The simulation results indicated that the nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite under shear deformation displays a linear elastic behavior up to shear stress of approximately 1.0 GPa, and shear deformation of about 0.08 radians, after which point yielding and plastic deformation occurs. The shear modulus determined from the simulations was 11.2 ± 0.7 GPa. The deformation-induced displacements in molecular structures were analyzed dividing the system in regions representing calcium oxide layers. The displacement/deformation of the layers of calcium oxide forming the structure of nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite was analyzed. The non-linear stress–strain behavior in the molecular structure was attributed to a non-linear increase in the displacement due to sliding of the calcium oxide layers on top of each other with higher shearing. These results support the idea that by controlling the chemical reactions, the tailored morphologies can be used to increase the interlinking between the calcium oxide layers, thus minimizing the shearing of the layers and leading to molecular structures that can withstand larger deformation and have improved failure behavior.

N2 - Computational fluid dynamics has a wide range of application in the study of room air distribution. The application is providing valuable guidance for those interested in such areas as comfort, productivity and sick building syndrome. This paper gives a comparative review of some of the work undertaken in the field and highlights some of the modelling assumptions noted within the literature. It is apparent from the review that the use of the CFD methodology is helping to develop our understanding of internal ventilation flows, yet it is also apparent that many investigations are currently employing modelling assumptions that will hinder the development of generic guidance from such investigations.

N2 - In the present work, effects of nozzle hole size and rail pressure under non-evaporating spray condition are demonstrated. Three single hole injectors with the bore size of 0.101, 0.122, and 0.133 mm are experimented with injection pressures of 140, 45, and 38 MPa respectively to achieve similar injection rate profile. Diesel spray experiments implement Diffused Backlight Illumination Technique where diffused background is obtained for the High Speed Video camera imaging. Experimental results are then validated with computational and analytical studies. The CFD simulation requires the injection rate profile and spray cone angle as a primary input; thus, based on the High Speed Video Camera start of injection frame the 5 kHz Butterworth low-pass frequency filter is applied to the injection rate raw data. While, the spray cone angle is predicted using a simple model obtained from the relationship between the injection velocity, fluctuating velocity at the nozzle exit and total pressure loss factor of the injector. The experimental spray tip penetration of all three injectors is almost identical as the similar injection rate profile is adopted. Although, the mixture characteristics are better for 0.101 mm hole diameter since the smaller hole diameter with highest injection pressure depicts larger spray angle and better atomization. The computational study agrees with experiments qualitatively; however, the quantitative and qualitative agreements are seen in the analytical study.

N2 - The wing of an unmanned aerial vehicle, RQ-7 Shadow, is modified to study the changes in the aerodynamics of the wing. The main focus is to investigate the effects of changing the components of wing design when the aircraft climbs and accelerates. These component modifications included changing the airfoil, planform, aspect ratio, and adding a winglet. Another objective is to study the efficacy of employing high-lift airfoils like the EPPLER 559 for subsonic unmanned aerial vehicle applications. For this, five wing designs are considered in this paper. Computational fluid dynamics simulations using ANSYS FLUENT® are conducted for each wing design. The CL/CD ratios for all the wings are calculated at increasing angles of attack (simulating Climbing) and increasing speed (simulating Acceleration). Compared to the NACA 4415 airfoil, which is utilized by the RQ-7 Shadow, the EPPLER 559 provides an increase in lift at the low angles of attack, but yields less of these benefits as the angle of attack increases. The tapered planform significantly reduces the high drag associated with the EPPLER 559 airfoil. The generation of higher lift forces with lower drag is further achieved by increasing the aspect ratio and through the addition of a winglet. When compared to the NACA 4415 airfoil, it is concluded that the EPPLER 559 airfoil is a viable candidate for subsonic unmanned aerial vehicle applications only when the components of wing design are altered. The performance of the wings that employ the EPPLER 559 airfoil improves when the planform is changed from rectangular to tapered, when the aspect ratio is increased and when a winglet is added.

N2 - Statistical modelling plays a central role for any prediction problem of interest. However, predictive models may give misleading results when the data contain outliers. In many real-world applications, it is important to identify and treat the outliers without direct elimination. To handle such issues, a hybrid computational method based on conic quadratic programming is introduced and employed on earthquake ground motion dataset. This method aims to minimize the impact of the outliers on regression estimators as well as handling the nonlinearity in the dataset. Results are compared against widely used parametric and nonparametric ground motion prediction models.

N2 - Many students with learning disabilities (LD) in mathematics receive their mathematics education in general education inclusive classes; therefore, these students must be capable of learning algebraic concepts, including developing algebraic thinking abilities, that are part of the general education curriculum. To help students develop algebraic thinking, teachers should ask questions in different ways to promote the ability to think algebraically. This article describes three types of questions—reversibility, flexibility, and generalizations—which support the acquisition of broader concepts leading to algebraic thinking. Examples of the question types within the contexts of rational numbers and integers are provided to assist teachers in creating similar questions for teaching mathematics to students with LD.

N2 - Using the test scores of more than 1,000,000 students who participated in the Advanced Placement Computer Science (AP CS) exams from 1997 to 2020, this study examined the direction and magnitude of the trends in gender disparity in participation and top achievement in advanced exams. The findings indicated that the male-to-female ratio (MFR) among AP Computer Science (CS) exam participants declined from 4.87 to 2.26 between 1997 and 2020. Similarly, the MFR among top scorers (students who scored 5 out of 5) in any type of AP CS exams declined rapidly, in favor of female students, from 8.00 to 2.14 during the same period. Possible implications of these findings for educators, particularly for AP CS teachers and school counselors, were also discussed in the context of the underrepresentation of females in computing fields.

N2 - This article examines how the ‘refugee crisis’, sparked by the arrival of refugees from the Syrian civil war and other conflicts around the world, was articulated across Dutch television news programs and social media between 2013 and 2018. This crisis has been described as a key catalyst of the radicalization of European political discourse. Crucially, it took shape during a period of profound transformation of the media landscape, in which mass media lost significant ground to social media as authoritative sources of truth and norms. The research focuses on the crucial but underexplored link between television and social media discourse, which is at the heart of contemporary European public debate. Using a combination of digital methods and NLP techniques, the article compares automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts of Dutch televised news on the refugee crisis with responses from publics on Facebook and Twitter. This computational cross-media approach enables a longitudinal analysis of how social media users differ in their interpretation of key events characterizing the crisis, as well as what language is acceptable to debate issues around integration, tolerance and identity. A rejection of mainstream news media editorial guidelines by social media users eventually resulted in their consumption of populist right-wing (‘alternative’) news media and active transgression of anti-discriminatory speech norms.

N2 - Utilizing a nationally representative sample of middle school students, this article focuses on whether students who report experiencing more inquiry-based instruction in science and mathematics classrooms have more positive attitudes toward these subjects. Results of multilevel, multivariate regression analyses revealed that, net of the inclusion of control variables for student, teacher, and school characteristics, a higher frequency of inquiry-based instruction is significantly associated with greater interest, perceptions of utility, and self-efficacy for science and mathematics. Furthermore, although there is some evidence indicating that compared with female students, male students’ perceptions of science utility are higher in relation to more inquiry-based instruction, overall, the weight of evidence clearly leans toward the conclusion that the attitudes of students from different gender and racial/ethnic backgrounds are similarly associated with greater exposure to inquiry-based instruction in both their science and mathematics classrooms.

N2 - Background Endoscopic medial maxillectomy (EMM) is a workhorse for multiple sinonasal conditions. To reduce its burden on the sinonasal physiology, several modified EMM (M-EMM) have been proposed. Objective: In order to provide a theoretical basis for EMM and its modifications, this study introduces a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, based on a time-resolved direct numerical simulation, describing EMM and assessing the role of the M-EMM in preserving the overall fluid dynamics of the sinonasal cavities. Methods A normal sinonasal CT scan was converted into a geometrical model and used as a reference; 2 anatomies were then created by virtual surgery, mimicking EMM and M-EMM, with the latter sparing the anterior portion of inferior turbinate and medial maxillary sinus wall. The airflow was simulated in the models via the OpenFOAM CFD software and compared in terms of flow rate, mean and fluctuating velocity, vorticity, and turbulent structures. Results The analysis shows that EMM induces a massive flow rate increase in the operated side, which becomes less obvious in the M-EMM model. In contrast to M-EMM, EMM induces higher velocity fields that reach the maxillary sinus. Velocity and vorticity fluctuations are negligible in the baseline model, but become increasingly evident and widespread in the M-EMM and EMM models. Conclusions A significant disruption of the nasal fluid dynamics is observed in EMM, while M-EMM minimizes variations and reduces interference with nasal air conditioning. Our analysis provides insights into the pathophysiology of radical sinus surgery and provides a theoretical basis for the ability of M-EMM to reduce the temporary surgery-related changes on both healthy and operated sides.

N2 - Introduction As an alternative to DNA microarrays, mass spectrometry based analysis of proteomic patterns has shown great potential in cancer diagnosis. The ultimate application of this technique in clinical settings relies on the advancement of the technology itself and the maturity of the computational tools used to analyze the data. A number of computational algorithms constructed on different principles are available for the classification of disease status based on proteomic patterns. Nevertheless, few studies have addressed the difference in the performance of these approaches. In this report, we describe a comparative case study on the classification accuracy of hepatocellular carcinoma based on the serum proteomic pattern generated from a Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization (SELDI) mass spectrometer. Methods Nine supervised classification algorithms are implemented in R software and compared for the classification accuracy. Results We found that the support vector machine with radial function is preferable as a tool for classification of hepatocellular carcinoma using features in SELDI mass spectra. Among the rest of the methods, random forest and prediction analysis of microarrays have better performance. A permutation-based technique reveals that the support vector machine with a radial function seems intrinsically superior in learning from the training data since it has a lower prediction error than others when there is essentially no differential signal. On the other hand, the performance of the random forest and prediction analysis of microarrays rely on their capability of capturing the signals with substantial differentiation between groups. Conclusions Our finding is similar to a previous study, where classification methods based on the Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry are compared for the prediction accuracy of ovarian cancer. The support vector machine, random forest and prediction analysis of microarrays provide better prediction accuracy for hepatocellular carcinoma using SELDI proteomic data than six other approaches.

N2 - In recent years, citizen engagement in policy and research has gained considerable momentum. In the healthcare domain, patient narratives, through various mediums, have emerged as a valuable source of insight into the experiences of patients and the healthcare system. Recognizing the value of such textual data, diverse analytical methods have been developed, spanning from text mining to narrative analysis. This article presents experiments that combine computational methods, qualitative methods and citizen science for analyzing patients’ stories. In this article, we reflect on two experiments in which we combined these approaches, which we analyze through a generative lens. We distinguish three main effects of the experiments: they provide a platform for discussions as a “site of controversy”; they act as “mediator”, fostering new connections and mutual understanding among participants; and they serve as “tin opener”, stimulating substantive discussions about methodological development and substantive healthcare matters. Narrative reduction, which occurs when rich narrative data is simplified into structured quantifiable forms, is not inherently problematic; instead, it can be meaningful when combined with qualitative methods and citizen science, emphasizing the importance of utilizing diverse methods to balance authenticity and gaining broader insights. The study highlights the significance of collaborative sense-making and meaning-making in interdisciplinary research. Engaging patients, their relatives, and professionals in the analytical process, facilitated by tools like word clouds, promotes engaged discussions that yield actionable insights. Further development of such interdisciplinary approaches holds promise for a more nuanced understanding of patient experiences, fostering epistemological pluralism, and refining healthcare practices.

N2 - Purpose To assess if finite element (FE) models can be used to predict deformation of the femoropopliteal segment during knee flexion. Methods Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) images were acquiredonthe lower limbs of 8 healthy volunteers (5 men; mean age 28±4 years). Images were taken in 2 natural positions, with the lower limb fully extended and with the knee bent at ∼40°. Patient-specific FE models were developed and used to simulate the experimental situation. The displacements of the artery during knee bending as predicted by the numerical model were compared to the corresponding positions measured on the MRA images. Results The numerical predictions showed a good overall agreement between the calculated displacements of the motion measures from MRA images. The average position error comparing the calculated vs. actual displacements of the femoropopliteal intersection measured on the MRA was 8±4 mm. Two of the 8 subjects showed large prediction errors (average 13±5 mm); these 2 volunteers were the tallest subjects involved in the study and had a low body mass index (20.5 kg/m2). Conclusion The present computational model is able to capture the gross mechanical environment of the femoropopliteal intersection during knee bending and provide a better understanding of the complex biomechanical behavior. However, results suggest that patient-specific mechanical properties and detailed muscle modeling are required to provide accurate patient-specific numerical predictions of arterial displacement. Further adaptation of this model is expected to provide an improved ability to predict the multiaxial deformation of this arterial segment during leg movements and to optimize future stent designs.

N2 - The accelerated post-Covid expansion of online worlds presents an unprecedented move of people into real-time interactive digital spaces. What does this change mean for the future of geography as a discipline? At this critical juncture, there is potential to rethink the position of the digital in geographical thought and praxis – to move beyond apparently common-sense categorizations of real and virtual, representation and reality. This commentary considers the implications of the contemporary push toward ‘metaversal’ thinking for geographical theory as well as the significance of virtual world-making for geographical theorizations of digital space and place. I suggest that key thinkers on space and media geographies must be re-evaluated and applied to this new wave of digital development. What is the significance of recent debates around emerging spaces like the metaverse, augmented reality, and virtual reality, understood not as happenings with distinct real and virtual counterparts, but as geographical – spatial – phenomena?

N2 - Abstract Since ballistic and blast survivability and off-road handling and stability of military vehicles, such as the high-mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV), are two critical vehicle performance aspects, they both (including the delicate balance between them) have to be considered when a new vehicle is being designed or an existing vehicle retrofitted (e.g. up-armoured). Finite-element-based transient non-linear dynamics and multi-body longitudinal dynamics computational analyses were employed, relatively, in the present work to address the following two specific aspects of the performance of an HMMWV: first, the ability of the vehicle to survive detonation of a landmine shallow buried into sand underneath the right wheel of the vehicle and, second, the ability of the vehicle to withstand a simple straight-line brake manoeuvre during off-road travel without compromising its stability and safety of its occupants. Within the first analysis, the kinematic and structural responses (including large-scale rotation and deformation, buckling, plastic yielding, failure initiation, fracture, and fragmentation) of the HMMWV to the detonation of a landmine were analysed computationally using the general-purpose transient non-linear dynamics analysis software ABAQUS/Explicit. The second analysis was carried out using Simpack, a general-purpose multi-body dynamics program, and the main purpose of this analysis was to address the vehicle stability during the off-road travel. The same sand model was used in both types of analysis. Finally, the computational results obtained are compared with general field-test observations and data in order to judge the physical soundness and fidelity of the present approach.

N2 - An in vivo axial loading model of the rat ulna was developed almost two decades ago. As a minimally invasive model, it lends itself particularly well for the study of functional adaptation in bone and the interosseous membrane, a ligament spanning between the radius and ulna. The objective of this paper is to review computational and experimental approaches to elucidate its applicability for the study of multiscale bone and ligament mechanobiology. Specifically, this review describes approaches, including i) measurement of strains on bone tissue surfaces, ii) development of a three-dimensional finite element (FE) mesh of a skeletally mature rat ulna, iii) parametric study of the relative influence of mechanical constants and materials properties on computational model predictions, iv) comparison of experimental and computational strain distribution data, and analysis of the radius and interosseous membrane (IOM) ligament’s effect on axial load distribution through the ulna of the rat, and v) the effect of mechanical loading on transport through the IOM using different molecular weight fluorescent tagged dextrans. In the first stage of the study a computational stress analysis was performed after applying a 20 N single static load at the ulnar extremities, corresponding to values of experimental strain gauge measurements. To account for the anisotropy of the bone matrix, transverse isotraopic, elastic material properties were applied. In a parametric study, we analyzed the qualitative effect of different material properties on the global load and displacement behavior of the computational model. In a second stage, the same ulnar model used in the parametric study was extended to account for the interaction between the ulna, radius and IOM. The three-dimensional FE model of the rat forelimb confirms the influence of ulnar curvature on its deformation and underscores the influence of the radius and IOM on strain distribution through the ulna. The mode of strain, {i.e.} compression or tension, and strain distribution along the bone diaphysis correspond to those measured experimentally in vivo. When the radius and, indirectly, the IOM were loaded, the bone deformation shifted distally with respect to the diaphysis. In a final stage, the aforementioned ulnar model was used to study the permeability of fluorescent tagged dextrans with different molecular weights in the presence and absence of ulnar compression. Small molecular weight dextrans (3,000 Da) were distributed throughout the IOM in the absence of as well as after mechanical loading. Interestingly, no gradient in distribution was observed in either case. In contrast, very high molecular weight dextrans (1,000,000 Da) were observed only within vascular and lymphatic spaces in the bone (as well as periosteum) and IOM, both in the absence of and after the application of mechanical loading via end load compression. Between the two extremes, both 10 and 70 kDa tracers were distributed throughout the IOM after application of compressive loading. Loading appears to dissipate the steep gradient of fluorescent 70 kDa tracer observed along the lateral surface of the unloaded IOM and its insertion into the radius and ulna. Hence, this combined computational and experimental analysis of the ulna compression model provides new insight into multiscale mechanobiology of the ulna-radius-interosseous membrane construct and may provide new avenues for elucidation of ligament’s remarkable structure-function relationships.

N2 - Radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation treats cardiac diseases by inducing thermal lesion of cardiac tissues through radiofrequency energy operating at around 500 kHz. The electromagnetic wavelength is significantly longer than the size of the radiofrequency active electrode, the tissue is heated through resistive heating. During thermal ablation, the coupled thermo-mechanical property of cardiac tissue influencing the contact area between the electrode and tissue plays a crucial role in the formation of thermal lesions, yet the literature often overlooks the effect of thermal deformation. This paper proposes a thermo-hyperelastic constitutive model for myocardium that models thermal contraction and expansion during ablation. Furthermore, a finite element model was established to investigate the effect of the electro-thermo-mechanical coupling property of myocardium on lesion formation under different contact forces. To ensure convergence, we solved the fully coupled electro-thermo-mechanical finite element model using the segregated step method. The computational results demonstrate that thermal deformation, which causes an expansion in the tissue-electrode contact area, increases lesion width and volume, while its influence on lesion depth is negligible. Specifically, after a 30-s ablation under contact forces of 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 N, the lesion volume increased from 4.53, 7.66, and 10.62 mm3 (without thermo-mechanical coupling) to 5.36, 8.33, and 13.34 mm3 (with thermo-mechanical coupling), respectively. Similarly, the lesion width increased from 2.68, 3.12, and 3.44 mm to 2.78, 3.22, and 3.62 mm. Moreover, both thermal deformation and contact force exert a minimal effect on lesion formation time.

N2 - Flame stabilization distribution and efficient fuel mixing are highly significant in the performance of ramjet engine. In this paper, numerical studies are done to investigate the supersonic combustion of hydrogen and air co-flow in presence of the ramp edge. In this study, flame maintenance and combustion formation in a dual-combustion ramjet engine are fully investigated. The primary emphasis of this work is to disclose the impact of produced shocks due to the existence of ramp edge on the structure of fuel and air-jet immediately downstream of injector. The shock interactions of two different angles (10 deg and 30 deg) of the ramp edge are investigated. Favre-averaged conservation equations are considered for the simulation of compressible flows inside the combustor. Various mechanisms expressing the flame spreading characteristics are also examined. Depending on the angle of the ramp edge, the produced shock waves influence on size and strength of vortices. Our findings also show that high angles of ramp edge augment the fluctuation of the vortices by the splitter and consequently, fuel mixing enhances in the combustion chamber of ramjet engine. Our findings also confirm that the similar jet pressure would be more effective on the vortex production downstream of the splitter. The application of ramp edge with angle of 30 deg would increase average momentum thickness of the mixing layer up to 55%.

N2 - This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of a compression—ignition (CI) heavy-duty engine fuelled with diesel and gasoline-like fuels. A state-of-the-art engine computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool was used to explore the influences of the physical and chemical properties of diesel and gasoline-like fuels (no. 91 gasoline and E10) on spray development, auto-ignition and combustion processes, and pollutant formation. The CFD simulation results were found to be consistent with available experimental measurements, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate that gasoline-like fuels are able to achieve better premixed charge in CI engines owing to their higher volatility and lower ignitability compared to diesel fuel, which promotes efficient, clean, and low temperature combustion. However, the high combustion pressure rise rate becomes problematic under some circumstances, especially for high octane number fuels, such as E10. Both previous experimental measurements and the present numerical results show that gasoline-like fuels have great potential to be used in future CI engines, but the injection strategies and injection system have to be optimized based on the fuel properties.

N2 - A comprehensive computational study, in both steady and unsteady flow conditions, has been carried out to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics of the Risø-B1-18 airfoil equipped with variable trailing edge geometry as produced by a hinged flap. The function of such flaps should be to decrease fatigue-inducing oscillations on the blades. The computations were conducted using a 2D incompressible RANS solver with a k-w turbulence model under the assumption of a fully developed turbulent flow. The investigations were conducted at a Reynolds number of Re = 1.6 · 106. Calculations conducted on the baseline airfoil showed excellent agreement with measurements on the same airfoil with the same specified conditions. Furthermore, a more widespread comparison with an advanced potential theory code is presented. The influence of various key parameters, such as flap shape, flap size and oscillating frequencies, was investigated so that an optimum design can be suggested for application with wind turbine blades. It is concluded that a moderately curved flap with flap chord to airfoil curve ratio between 0.05 and 0.10 would be an optimum choice.

N2 - Intelligent driving has been benefiting from advances in automotive big data analysis and on-demand data communications, where efficient vehicle-to-cloud communication is a key technology able to collect a huge amount of data from vehicles. However, as the capacities of the network and computational resources of the cloud are not unlimited, simultaneous data transfer based on a best-effort manner results in a resource starvation problem. Therefore, an application is needed to prioritize data communication to alleviate the problem and complete the data transfer just in time. This paper highlights the problem of resource starvation led by best-effort data transfers. It proposes protocols for data communication and control that could enable just-in-time data communication, notably for data collection. We demonstrate through experiments that the proposed mechanism enables efficient and effective data collection over the shared network resources.

N2 - BACKGROUND: Medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) could be concerned with wear of the cartilage or the wear in the polyethylene (PE) insert. Mechanical alignment determines the biomechanical effect in the long term. However, previous computational studies all found that femoral and tibial components alignment in the UKA were rare, and the results varied. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical effect of the femoral and tibial component coronal alignment in varus and valgus conditions through computational simulation. METHODS: A three-dimensional finite element model of the intact knee was constructed from medical image data of one healthy subject. A medial UKA model of neutral position and various coronal components was developed from the intact knee joint model. The tibial varus-femoral valgus and tibial valgus-femoral varus conditions were analyzed with parallel component angles of 3°, 6° and 9° by using validated finite element models. We considered the contact stresses in the PE inserts and articular cartilage and the force on collateral ligament under gait cycle condition. RESULTS: Compared to the contact stress in the neutral position model, the contact stress on the PE insert increased in both tibial varus-femoral valgus and tibial valgus-femoral varus models. These trends were also observed in the case of the articular cartilage in remain compartment. However, the contact stress on the PE insert and articular cartilage increased largely in the tibial valgus-femoral varus model than in the tibial varus-femoral valgus model. The forces on the medial and lateral collateral ligaments increased in the tibial valgus-femoral varus model, whereas in the tibial varus-femoral valgus model, the forces decreased compared to the forces in the neutral position. The force on the anterior lateral ligament and popliteofibular ligament increased in the tibial varus-femoral valgus model as compared to the neutral position. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that neutral alignment or less than 3° tibial varus-femoral valgus alignment in the coronal plane can be recommended in medial UKA to reduce the postoperative complications and to enhance the life expectancy of implants.

N2 - Circuit dynamics are an outcome of the constant interplay between the intrinsic properties of neurons and the strengths of the synaptic connections among them. Examples from the small networks that generate the rhythms of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion are used to illustrate general features of the different time scales over which both synaptic and intrinsic properties are altered by circuit activity and neuromodulation. These demonstrate that neither intrinsic membrane properties nor synaptic strengths should be considered fixed parameters; rather, they are dynamic variables with time scales that range from milliseconds to days.

N2 - Schools around the globe increasingly realized the importance of technology and its application in the education system. To guarantee a successful educational innovation, schools seek out different parties for valuable opinions. Among them, parents are the important feedback providers, because their attitudes are influential on children’s academic performance. Moreover, their involvement and support are considered the key factor that facilitates an effective implementation of programming education at schools. This study aimed at developing and validating an instrument measuring parents’ perceptions of programming education among P-12 schools in Hong Kong. We propose that parents’ perceptions of programming education is a multidimensional construct which constitutes (a) understanding, (b) support, and (c) expectation. In total, 524 questionnaires were collected from the parents who attended programming workshops and seminars. Exploratory factor analysis shows evidence for the three-dimensional construct. Confirmatory factor analysis reconfirms the measurement structure. Implications of the study are discussed.

N2 - We previously developed a core representation for computationally comparing the information an operator needs to perform a task and the information provided by a user interface. This representation is based on information theoretic properties, thus it can be applied to a wide variety of work domains and information and display types. In prior work, we used this capability to dynamically and automatically reconfigure cockpit displays for military cockpits. More recently, we adapted this approach to the task of evaluating and critiquing display format designs for NASA’s space operations. The representation and reasoning approach generalizes well to describing information types in procedural domains and the tool can analyze sets of display formats for sets of procedures, propose format improvements against a procedure set, project how changes to procedures will affect the suitability of existing formats, and project how changes to formats will improve or reduce their suitability for given procedures. Most recently, we have proposed extensions to evaluate and support “configuration consistency” of interfaces, within a system over time, across systems and even across vehicles and their associated work domains.

N2 - The process of coating textiles with a blade coater has been investigated with CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software. The simulations have uncovered a pressure drop in the area between the edge of the knife and the textile. This drop can be explained by the varying height of the flow channel which is made of the knife and the textile in conjunction with the no slip condition that is applied to the walls. In the simulations this drop became arbitrarily deep with increasing viscosity leading to negative absolute pressure levels. This may be a hint that the no slip condition is not valid in this scenario that involves shear rates of the order of 103/s and dynamic viscosities of around 10 to 100Pas. With a proposed slip condition for the textile the pressure drop became less pronounced. At the same time the flow rate through the gap between knife and textile was reduced leading to a thinner coating. This can be a hint that a slip between coating material and textile can cause distortions in the coating up to a complete disruption which is reported frequently by the industry. This could eventually be avoided by reducing the varying height of the flow channel. Alternatively a vertical lift of the textile due to the negative pressure was taken into account. This lift appeared only with low tensions of the textile of about 1N/m and showed no influence on coating thickness and pressure drop.

N2 - Minimum miscibility pressure is the least required pressure for complete mixing of gas and oil in the reservoir conditions. It is an important parameter in the processes of gas injection in a miscible manner and its precise determination is very vital in choosing the type of injecting gas and planning injecting equipment for increasing the recovery efficiency. The common method is determining MMP in slim tube or 1-D simulation of slim tube. Usually determining the minimum miscibility pressure via slim tube apparatus is an expensive and time-consuming test and to carry it out it is necessary to have a sample of reservoir oil and suggested injecting gas. Occasionally it is possible that for some unknown reasons despite spending much time and money it won’t bring up any result. As a result, for determining this parameter, finding another method which has a higher precision in addition to being swift and less expensive is very necessary. On the other hand, there are several simulation methods to determine minimum miscibility pressure. These methods are so fast rather than slim tube experiment and relatively precise. MMP can be estimated numerically using compositional simulation, method of characteristics (MOC), mixing-cell methods, intelligent methods, and empirical correlations. However, nowadays one dimensional (1-D) slim tube simulation based on compositional simulation is very common. In this paper a suggestive method is proposed for determining MMP. A mixing rule method coupled with artificial neural network model (ANN) based on a numerous experiment data. Accuracy and computational time of artificial neural network method were compared to common prior models and correlations. The results show although intelligent methods are so fast, 1-D slim tube simulation is still a proper method to determine MMP in high accuracy. Average absolute relative error for MMP value is 1.5% for 1-D slim tube simulation, while the number for ANN is 3.25%. However, ANN method is recommended for fast MMP estimation.

N2 - This article’s aim is to explore the possibilities and limitations of some quantitative tools for the analysis of images. It shows how three different families of tools – manual annotation, eye-tracking and signifier analysis – can help to better understand the meaning effects of figurative and plastic (abstract) elements in pictures. Advantages and disadvantages for each family of tools are discussed. The author also suggests some theoretical implications of the adoption of quantitative tools in the humanities and especially within semiotic disciplines.

Particular attention was devoted to developing and using algorithms that exploit the capabilities of current vector supercomputers. A key component in this procedure is the recursive transformation of the large sparse Hamiltonian matrix into a much smaller tridiagonal matrix. An ap plication to time-dependent laser-mole cule energy transfer is presented. Rate of energy deposition in the multimode mole cule for systematic variations in the mo lecular intermode coupling parameters is emphasized.

N2 - System knowledge and reasoning mechanisms are essential means for intellectualization of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). As enablers of system intelligence, they make such systems able to solve application problems and to maintain their efficient operation. Normally, system intelligence has a human-created initial part and a system-produced (extending) part, called synthetic system intelligence (SSI). This position paper claims that SSI can be converted to a new industrial asset and utilized as such. Unfortunately, no overall theory of SSI exists and its conceptual framework, management strategy, and computational methodologies are still in a premature stage. This is the main reason why no significant progress has been achieved in this field, contrary to the latent potentials. This paper intends to contribute to: (i) understanding the nature and fundamentals of SSI, (ii) systematizing the elicitation and transfer of SSI, (iii) exploration of analogical approaches to utilization of SSI, and (iv) road-mapping and scenario development for the exploitation of SSI as an industrial asset. First, the state of the art is surveyed and the major findings are presented. Then, four families of analogical approaches to SSI transfer are analyzed. These are: (i) knowledge transfer based on repositories, (ii) transfer among agents, (iii) transfer of learning resources, and (iv) transfer by emerging approaches. A procedural framework is proposed that identifies the generic functionalities needed for a quasi-autonomous handling of SSI as an industrial asset. The last section casts light on some important open issues and necessary follow-up research and development activities.

N2 - Abstract We analyzed the interrelationships between mixture heterogeneity and reaction in a premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) combustion, using large eddy simulation (LES) in conjunction with a reaction kinetics model. The aim of this analysis is to find the statistical characteristics of the mixture heterogeneity in a turbulent flowfield for moderating the PCCI combustion and for increasing an output limit, which is restricted by a severe knock. Several different initial conditions of heterogeneity of an air-fuel or air-fuel-EGR gas mixture were given at the intake valve closing time by a new method, which generated statistically reasonable turbulent fluctuations in both velocity and fuel mass fraction fields. The autoignition and combustion behaviours were analysed for several different sets of the r.m.s. and the length scale of the fluctuations in the fuel mass fraction. The analyses show that the combination of a larger r.m.s. value and a longer-length scale of the fluctuations in fuel mass fraction is effective to slow the combustion in a hot flame reaction phase and to avoid knocking. The analytical results also show that the heterogeneous distribution of an EGR gas has a considerable effect in making the combustion slower, even when a fuel-air mixture is homogeneous.

N2 - The process of coating textiles with a blade coater has been investigated with CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software. The simulations have uncovered a pressure drop in the area between the edge of the knife and the textile. This drop can be explained by the varying height of the flow channel which is made of the knife and the textile in conjunction with the no slip condition that is applied to the walls. In the simulations this drop became arbitrarily deep with increasing viscosity leading to negative absolute pressure levels. This may be a hint that the no slip condition is not valid in this scenario that involves shear rates of the order of 103/s and dynamic viscosities of around 10 to 100Pas. With a proposed slip condition for the textile the pressure drop became less pronounced. At the same time the flow rate through the gap between knife and textile was reduced leading to a thinner coating. This can be a hint that a slip between coating material and textile can cause distortions in the coating up to a complete disruption which is reported frequently by the industry. This could eventually be avoided by reducing the varying height of the flow channel. Alternatively a vertical lift of the textile due to the negative pressure was taken into account. This lift appeared only with low tensions of the textile of about 1N/m and showed no influence on coating thickness and pressure drop.

N2 - The ability to conduct reasoned argument (to support opinions with non-spurious evidence, to anticipate what evidence would support alternative opinions, to weigh the quality of competing items of evidence, and so on) is a key component of critical thinking. Kuhn (1991) suggested that practice might help improve thinking skills, and in particular that peer-based practice would be effective in improving such skills. Three studies that attempted to use peer interaction to help enhance students’ argumentative reasoning skills are briefly reviewed. Some evidence is provided that supports Kuhn’s advocacy of peer-based practice; however, some of the studies have supplemented the peer-based element of the situation with a more traditional, instruction-based teaching component. Nevertheless, it is concluded that peer interaction is a potentially useful method for helping inculcate thinking skills.

N2 - The concept of water quality has often generally revolved around the all-round safety of water for human consumption. The quality of much of the 3% of the earth’s humanly consumable water classed as freshwater is under threat of climate change, rising population numbers, indiscriminate land usage, detrimental agricultural practices and contamination from poor waste management. The need for optimal water quality enhancement has become more germane to sustainable socio-economic development. This paper examines the evolution of efforts made by the scientific community over the years to ensure water quality can be characterized and properly managed to ensure the global ever-growing demand for clean water for human consumption is continually met. The development of state-of-the-art computational decision support systems (DSS) should play a vital role. However, efforts in this regard are currently bedevilled by major challenges such as quantifying, measuring, processing and controlling the numerous metrics of water quality, as well as their adaptation and integration into a fully developed universal water quality model. In addressing these challenges, a shift towards simpler modelling approaches and the integration of uni-purpose models which can be cascaded into decision-making systems is being popularly proposed. However, with technological advancements already stimulating a water quality management revolution, there is a shift in paradigm to more universal modelling attempts with great optimism towards overcoming the challenges of developing universal water quality models and DSS. The prospects and opportunities of a water quality management renaissance offered by radical scientific innovations look promising, as the world races with time to provide support systems that can help deal better with the dynamics of sustainable water supply in increasingly contaminable environments and progressively unpredictable climates.

Despite industry desires for journalists with coding skills, nearly 40% of the units offer no coding classes. Among programs that require code, most rely on a course or courses taught by full-time faculty in the accredited unit. About one third of units that do not require code currently have plans to add it in the future.

N2 - Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has been shown to be an effective technology for reducing the airborne bioburden in indoor environments and is already advocated as a potential infection control measure for healthcare settings. However, much of the understanding of UVGI performance is based on experimental studies or numerical simulation in mechanically ventilated environments. This study considers the application of an upper-room UVGI system in a naturally ventilated multi-bed hospital ward. A computational fluid dynamics model is used to simulate a Nightingale-type hospital ward with wind-driven cross-ventilation and three wall-mounted UVGI fixtures. A parametric study considering 50 different fixture configurations and three ventilation rates was carried out using a design of experiments approach. Each configuration was assessed by calculating the UV dose distribution over the ward and at each bed. Results show that dose is influenced by the location of the fixtures and the ventilation regime. Thermal effects are likely to be important at low ventilation rates and may reduce UV effectiveness. A metamodel-based numerical optimisation was applied at a ventilation rate of 6 air changes per hour. In this case, the optimum result is achieved when UVGI fixtures are mounted on the leeward wall at their lowest mounting height.

N2 - General value functions (GVFs) in the reinforcement learning (RL) literature are long-term predictive summaries of the outcomes of agents following specific policies in the environment. Affordances as perceived action possibilities with specific valence may be cast into predicted policy-relative goodness and modeled as GVFs. A systematic explication of this connection shows that GVFs and especially their deep-learning embodiments (1) realize affordance prediction as a form of direct perception, (2) illuminate the fundamental connection between action and perception in affordance, and (3) offer a scalable way to learn affordances using RL methods. Through an extensive review of existing literature on GVF applications and representative affordance research in robotics, we demonstrate that GVFs provide the right framework for learning affordances in real-world applications. In addition, we highlight a few new avenues of research opened up by the perspective of “affordance as GVF,” including using GVFs for orchestrating complex behaviors.

N2 - This paper describes the implementation of the initial strain energy-based thermo-elastoviscoplastic two-parameter damage self-healing models for bituminous materials to compare the model predictions with experimental measurements. Computational algorithms based on the two-step operator splitting methodology are proposed and employed for numerical results. The elastic two-parameter damage self-healing predictor and the viscoplastic corrector are coupled with the Arrhenius-type temperature term via the net stress concept in conjunction with the hypothesis of strain equivalence and then systematically used for numerical implementation of the models. Four numerical examples of three-dimensional problems are first demonstrated for the effect of temperature and rest period for healing phenomenon. Second, experimental validation of the proposed model against monotonic constant-strain test at different temperatures and controlled-strain cyclic tension test is presented. It is observed that numerical simulations by the two-parameter model agree well with experimental results. In particular, the softening responses of the bituminous composites are well predicted for monotonic constant-strain rate test and the viscous damage behavior can be reasonably predicted by the proposed two-parameter damage models. It is noted that the two-parameter model can better predict the thermo-mechanical behavior of asphalt and is more versatile than the one-parameter isotropic damage self-healing model.

N2 - Cathodic protection (CP) is widely used to mitigate corrosion and protect the substrate. However, sacrificial anodes are often undersized or improperly positioned. This study systematically investigates how anode design factors affect the CP effectiveness through computational modelling and double-objective optimisation techniques around the optimum location and dimension of anodes. State-of-the-art algorithms including the Monte-Carlo, Nelder–Mead, co-ordinate search, constrained optimisation by linear approximation (COBYLA) and bound optimisation by quadratic approximation (BOBYQA) are employed to optimise anode locations and genetic algorithm is utilised for optimising anode dimension and the objective is maximising the current output and minimising the cost. In the current study, the BOBYQA technique proved efficient in reaching the optimal response at the appropriate time. The findings indicate that in double-objective (cost and potential) optimisation of 14.5 kg anode, minimising anode radius (from 6.5 cm to 5.4 cm) and optimising the position boosts the current output by up to 15.5%. Refined anode geometries increase the average structure potentials (806 → 822 mV) by over 15 mV, translating to extended service lifetimes. In the comparison of single (cost) and double (cost and potential)-objective optimisation, about 15% more current reaches the structure and causes about 2% less anode mass loss for the same anode dimensions. Also, the results show the 7.7 kg anode performs better than the 14.5 kg anode and so output current and the percentage of current that reaches the structure of the 7.7 kg and 14.5 kg are 0.66 A and 0.46 A and 66% and 60%, respectively.

N2 - Urban building energy modelling (UBEM) is a prevalent research method to examine the multi-scale building to urban renovation in mitigating global energy-related carbon emissions. However, only a few studies delineate a complete workflow from generation to application using UBEM. In particular, to facilitate the designing of sustainable built environments, existing research needs to emphasize the integration of multi-scale energy performance evaluation within the design development process for architects and urban planners. The key challenges lie in the need for integrated datasets and incompatibility between software tools required for designing, modelling, and evaluation. This paper presents a comprehensive methodological framework to investigate applicable urban decarbonization strategies. A case study of Sheffield in the UK demonstrates the development of an automated and standardized computational workflow. This data-driven workflow aims to evaluate energy demand and supply scenarios at an urban scale to access the potential of decarbonizing built environments. The workflow is designed to be adaptable to various scales of urban regions, given a suitable geographic information system (GIS) dataset.

N2 - The shape of dose response of ionizing radiation (IR) induced cancer at low dose region, either linear non-threshold or J-shaped, has been a debate for a long time. This dose response relationship can be influenced by built-in capabilities of cells that minimize the fixation of IR-mediated DNA damage as pro-carcinogenic mutations. Key capabilities include sensing of damage, activation of cell cycle checkpoint arrests that provide time needed for repair of the damage as well as apoptosis. Here we describe computational modeling of the signaling pathways that link sensing of DNA damage and checkpoint arrest activation/apoptosis to investigate how these molecular-level interactions influence the dose response relationship for IR induced cancer. The model provides qualitatively accurate descriptions of the IR-mediated activation of cell cycle checkpoints and the apoptotic pathway, and of time-course activities and dose response of relevant regulatory proteins (e.g. p53 and p21). Linking to a two-stage clonal growth cancer model, the model described here successfully captured a monotonically increasing to a J-shaped dose response curve and identified one potential mechanism leading to the J-shape: the cell cycle checkpoint arrest time saturates with the increase of the dose.

N2 - The fabric air dispersion system (FADS) is a ventilation terminal made of special polymer fabric. The porous structure of the fabric causes complex flow motion. Due to its advantages over the conventional ventilation system, i.e. ducts and diffusers, the FADS has been widely favoured by architects and researchers. In computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation the FADS is usually simplified into a free opening with an area equal to all pores and perforations, called the free area (FA) method in this present work. However, the effectiveness of this simplified method has not been validated. The present work took a half cylindrical FADS without orifices as an example and employed the FA method to simulate the airflow properties inside a chamber under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. The simulated distributions of air velocity and temperature were compared with those by the direct description (DD) method. Meanwhile, the uniformity of air velocity distribution close to the FADS was validated against test data and the flow visualization using the dry ice as a smoking material. Results demonstrate that the FA method is effective and easy to implement, and performs as well as the DD method in predicting the distribution of airflow generated by the FADS without orifices.

N2 - Two plume formulae commonly used in fire safety engineering design were assessed by simulating the aerodynamics induced by a fire. The self-developed fire field model CY-TEAM, based on a modified two-equation k-" turbulence model, was used to predict the air flow and temperature field. Twelve simulations of varying heat release rate and perimeter of fire, with bounded and unbounded ceiling, were carried out. It is found that the power law for the mass flux with height holds. At the plume region, the two equations for mass flux would give the same result for those fires with heat release rate related to its perimeter. Results were compared with experimental data and with another set of simulations with finer grids. Further, part of the results are compared with those predicted by the new fire field model FDS based on large eddy simulation developed at Building and Fire Research Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA. Good agreement among k-" turbulence model, large eddy simulation model and experimental data were found. A further verification on CY-TEAM in studying plume induced by heptane pool fires was reported.

N2 - The mechanisms involved in the abnormal grain growth of the iron based oxide dispersion strengthened alloys are analysed in the present work. Its microstructural evolution takes place at high temperatures (0.9Tm) and is characterised by an initial submicrometre size microstructure and a strong < 110>|| rolling direction (RD) texture that evolves into a few extremely coarse grains (mm sizes) with < 112>||RD orientation. The analysis of the observed grain boundaries has been completed by molecular dynamics simulations. Microstructure evolution consists of an extended recovery process, followed by an abnormal grain growth stage, consequence of the orientation pinning mechanism and the proximity to a symmetric tilt boundary family between the < 110>||RD and < 112>||RD grains.

N2 - Abstract Unsaturated flow of liquid in a bed of uniform and spherical ore particles is studied numerically and experimentally. An unsteady and two-dimensional model is developed on the basis of the mass conservation equations of liquid phase in the bed and in the particles. The model equations are solved using a fully implicit finite difference method giving the distribution of the degree of saturation in the particles and in the bed and the vertical velocity of flow in the bed, as well as the effect of periodic infiltration on the above distributions. To calibrate the computational model, several column tests are performed using periodic infiltration of water on 40 cm high columns composed of ore having particles smaller than 25 mm. The numerical analysis shows that the results obtained from numerical modelling under the same operating conditions as used for column tests are in good agreement with those from experimental procedure, the degree of saturation of the bed and the time required to reach steady state conditions depend on the inflow of water and intrinsic permeability of the bed and the velocity fluctuations and the fluctuations of the degree of saturation in the bed depend on the inflow of water, period of infiltration, height and intrinsic permeability of the bed.

N2 - α-Amylase is one of the important enzymes in the starch-processing industry. However, starch processing requires high temperature, thus resulting in high cost. The high adsorptivity of α-amylase to the substrate allows this enzyme to digest the starch at a lower temperature. α-Amylase from Saccharomycopsis fibuligera R64 (Sfamy R64), a locally sourced enzyme from Indonesia, has a high amylolytic activity but low starch adsorptivity. The objective of this study was to design a computational model of Sfamy R64 with increased starch adsorptivity using bioinformatics method. The model structure of Sfamy R64 was compared with the positive control, ie, Aspergillus niger α-amylase. The structural comparison showed that Sfamy R64 lacks the surface-binding site (SBS). An SBS was introduced to the structure of Sfamy R64 by S383Y/S386W mutations. The dynamics and binding affinity of the SBS of mutant to the substrate were also improved and comparable with that of the positive control.

N2 - As a method for bonding powdered materials, sintering has distinct advantages, such as the production of a near final-shape of the desired product, without the need for significant post-processing. However, sintering has certain deficiencies, such as incomplete or weak bonding. Research is ongoing to improve the process. One approach to improve sintering processes of powdered materials is via electrically enhanced bonding, whereby electricity is pumped through the material, while it is compressed in a press, in order to induce Joule-heating. This paper develops a computationally based model for the direct simulation of electrically enhanced sintering of powdered materials using particle-based methods. The overall approach is to construct three coupled sub-models which primarily involve: (a) particle-to-particle mechanical contact, (b) particle-to-particle thermal exchange and (c) particle-to-particle electrical current flow. These physical processes are strongly coupled, since the dynamics dictates which particles are in contact and the contacts determine the electrical flow. The flow of electricity controls the Joule-heating and the induced thermal fields, which soften the material, leading to enhanced particle binding. The strong multiphysics-coupled sub-models are solved iteratively within each time-step using a recursive staggering scheme, which employs temporal adaptivity to control the error. If the process does not converge (to within an error tolerance) within a preset number of iterations, the time-step is adapted (reduced) by utilizing an estimate of the spectral radius of the coupled system. The modular approach allows for easy replacement of submodels, if needed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the model and numerical solution scheme.

N2 - Thermoplastics hold utmost importance in the day-to-day life of modern-day society, being widely employed in water transport and storage vessels commonly made from thermoplastics such as PVC, i.e., polyvinyl chloride, and PP, i.e., polypropylene. This urge for a joining technique is applicable even with water in the vessel or the submerged case. The present investigation explores ultrasonic welding as an option to weld thermoplastics in water-submerged conditions. We have performed FEM simulations and experimental validation to prove the viability of the proposed ultrasonic welding process used in welding PVC and PP in water-submerged conditions. The discussed results demonstrate a decrease in melting and degradation of adherend material at the weld interface while welding PVC and PP in water-submerged conditions and attaining 65.78% and 107% of weld strength, unlike their open-air counterparts, respectively.

N2 - Liver cancer kills approximately 800 thousand people annually worldwide, and its most common subtype is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which usually affects people with cirrhosis. Predicting survival of patients with HCC remains an important challenge, especially because technologies needed for this scope are not available in all hospitals. In this context, machine learning applied to medical records can be a fast, low-cost tool to predict survival and detect the most predictive features from health records. In this study, we analyzed medical data of 165 patients with HCC: we employed computational intelligence to predict their survival, and to detect the most relevant clinical factors able to discriminate survived from deceased cases. Afterwards, we compared our data mining results with those obtained through statistical tests and scientific literature findings. Our analysis revealed that blood levels of alkaline-phosphatase (ALP), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and hemoglobin are the most effective prognostic factors in this dataset. We found literature supporting association of these three factors with hepatoma, even though only AFP has been used in a prognostic index. Our results suggest that ALP and hemoglobin can be candidates for future HCC prognostic indexes, and that physicians could focus on ALP, AFP, and hemoglobin when studying HCC records.

N2 - Although the literature on evaluation has theorized about the distinction between internal and external evaluation, hardly any research has compared them empirically. This article examines whether the lessons of internal evaluations differed from those of external evaluations in the case of international development aid. It analyzes internal evaluations of the Asian Development Bank for nearly 1000 sovereign interventions across 38 countries in the Asia-Pacific during 1996–2016, using computational text analysis or text mining techniques. The results show that internal evaluations focused more on micro- and meso-level characteristics, while external evaluations laid more emphasis on meso- and macro-level constructs, such as dimensions of policy and the institutional environment in the recipient country, or its level and rate of economic growth. The article concludes that internal and external evaluations can be combined to create a multilevel evaluation framework that integrates micro-, meso-, and macro-level lessons to facilitate better learning.

N2 - Abstract A theoretical and computational investigation into the electrochemical machining (ECM) process for the case of a moving stepped tool eroding an initially flat surface is presented. Five parametric variations of the basic geometry of the stepped tool machining process are possible, depending on the relative distance between the moving tool and eroded work. For each of the five cases, and based on one-dimensional theory, formulae have been developed to predict the minimum depth of working material that must initially be provided to enable a particular step size to be machined to a specified tolerance. The computer simulation of the ECM process which has been developed is based on the finite element method (FEM). The geometry of tool, electrolyte and work is simulated by means of a two-dimensional mesh of square elements. A system of macros has been developed which interact internally with an FE package to move component boundaries systematically to simulate both tool movement and surface erosion. Such boundary movements are accomplished automatically and continuously without user intervention during a simulation run. The algorithms employed to achieve characteristically different erosion rates are described. Results both from one-dimensional ECM theory and from the computer simulations of the characteristic cases are presented. Comparisons show that there is good agreement between computer predictions and theory. The differential erosion process is fundamental to all ECM processes. Complex shapes evolve because of spatial differences in erosion rates. Thus the one-dimensional results presented here for the formation of a step should provide a basis for comparisons between spatially separated regions of one-dimensional differential erosion on bodies of arbitrary shape.

N2 - There are many benefits of using argumentation-based techniques in multi-agent systems, as clearly shown in the literature. Such benefits come not only from the expressiveness that argumentation-based techniques bring to agent communication but also from the reasoning and decision-making capabilities under conditions of conflicting and uncertain information that argumentation enables for autonomous agents. When developing multi-agent applications in which argumentation will be used to improve agent communication and reasoning, argumentation schemes (reasoning patterns for argumentation) are useful in addressing the requirements of the application domain in regards to argumentation (e.g., defining the scope in which argumentation will be used by agents in that particular application). In this work, we propose an argumentation framework that takes into account the particular structure of argumentation schemes at its core. This paper formally defines such a framework and experimentally evaluates its implementation for both argumentation-based reasoning and dialogues.

N2 - Given a constant stream of perceptual stimuli, how can the underlying invariances associated with a given input be learned? One approach consists of using generic truths about the spatiotemporal structure of the physical world as constraints on the types of quantities learned. The learning methodology employed here embodies one such truth: that perceptually salient properties (such as stereo disparity) tend to vary smoothly over time. Unfortunately, the units of an artificial neural network tend to encode superficial image properties, such as individual grey-level pixel values, which vary rapidly over time. However, if the states of units are constrained to vary slowly, then the network is forced to learn a smoothly varying function of the training data. We implemented this temporal-smoothness constraint in a backpropagation network which learned stereo disparity from random-dot stereograms. Temporal smoothness was formalised with the use of regularisation theory by modifying the standard cost function minimised during training of a network. Temporal smoothness was found to be similar to other techniques for improving generalisation, such as early stopping and weight decay. However, in contrast to these, the theoretical underpinnings of temporal smoothing are intimately related to fundamental characteristics of the physical world. Results are discussed in terms of regularisation theory and the physically realistic assumptions upon which temporal smoothing is based.

N2 - Purpose Investigation of pigment epithelial detachment (PED) characteristics in central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is underrepresented in the literature. We present a novel computational approach to quantify PED composition indices (PEDCI) in CSCR and track changes over time. Methods 34 eyes with active CSCR were analyzed quarterly over a 1-year period. Cases were categorized into acute and chronic CSCR depending on a symptom duration of less than 3 months or more than 3 months respectively. PED, retinal and choroidal dimensions were manually measured, and interval changes were compared using repeated measures of variance ANOVA. PED composition analysis involved manual segmentation followed by automated sub segmentation of PED areas to identify serous, neovascular and fibrous tissues. PEDCI for each component was compared among cases of acute and chronic CSCR. Results CMT and NSD-h decreased by 65.2 µm (p = 0.01), and 86.5 µm (p < 0.01) respectively at 12 months. At baseline, 7/17 acute CSCR eyes and 8/15 chronic CSCR eyes had a concomitant PED; acute cases had both serous and neovascular components (PEDCI-S: 16.95%, PEDCI-N: 40.3%), whereas chronic cases only had a neovascular component (PEDCI-S: 0%, PEDCI-N: 30.5%). At 12-month follow-up, 6/7 of acute CSCR group and 6/8 chronic CSCR group had a concomitant PED; PEDCI-S was largest for acute CSCR (53.4%) and PEDCI-N was largest for chronic CSCR (46.7%). Conclusion We identify a novel biomarker PEDCI to differentiate acute and chronic CSCR with higher PEDCI-S in acute CSCR, and higher PEDCI-N in chronic CSCR.

The methodology extends the Harvard Computer Fire Code V for computing the dynamic history of a fire in a single room to connecting rooms by adding the appropriate flow physics. Finally, an example is presented where an object is burning in a room which is connected to a second room via a door way. The evolution of the hot layer and vent flows are discussed, and compared to the same evolution of a single room structure.

N2 - The paper suggests a focused examination of the processes of drafting-based design and parametric design in urbanism. It discusses how spatial design’s settled cognition would differ by using algorithmic systems through the altered relationships between the basic operations in design. To reveal the commonalities and distinctions between the two design methods, the authors present the detailed documentation of the workshop series, which experimented with both techniques within similar design contexts. By the design analysis, the idea of “parametric thinking” is revisited in the specific context of urban design.

N2 - Although desktop computers have been considered in many computational fluid dynamics (CFD) indoor simulations, they were usually simplified as hot boxes. A real desktop computer, however, is not only a heat source but also a momentum source due to the jet airflow generated by the computer case fan. The airflow induced by a desktop case fan could have the same order of magnitude as the ventilation rate of the whole room, and thus is expected to have significant influence upon the indoor airflow field and distribution of contaminants. Obviously, the simplification of desktop computer into a hot box does not sufficiently stand for the actual situation. In this study, a CFD model of a typical office room was built and simulations were conducted to investigate the airflow field and volatile organic compounds (VOC) distribution under two scenarios: (1) computer as a ‘hot box’ without a fan and (2) a more realistic computer model with an operating case fan. The comparison of CFD results yielded from these two scenarios demonstrated that the role of computer fan is very important in terms of airflow field and contaminant distribution and should be included in CFD office simulations for the purpose of improved reliability.

N2 - With the tremendous growth of science and technology in the world, the silent submarine has been an interesting research topic for many years. What is of equal interest is how to produce a high-speed submarine that limits noise to minimise detection from the enemy. In this study, we investigated the combination of a propeller and a duct so that when a submarine is operated, it minimises as much as possible the noise without affecting the speed of the submarine. The goal of installing the duct outside the propeller is to reduce the noise and loss of thrust simultaneously. The purpose of this article is to investigate the variation of the magnitude of the noise and thrust that occurs when a submarine propeller is operated in six different types of ducts. The research method is to use the large eddy simulation method with the cavitation model and then to calculate the result using the finite volume method. The study found that Ducts 1 and 4 have a better noise reduction effect and better propulsion than the other four ducts. Among them, Duct 4 has the best noise reduction effect, and Duct 1 provides the maximum propulsion. In all of the computation examples herein, the cavitation phenomenon did not occur. In the future, we will continue to study the growth and decline of related physical quantities with various types of propellers and ducts.

N2 - As digital platforms have come to play a central role in the news and information ecosystem, a new realm of watchdog journalism has emerged – the platform beat. Journalists on the platform beat report on the operation, use and misuse of social media platforms and search engines. The platform beat can serve as an important mechanism for increasing the accountability of digital platforms, in ways that can affect public trust in the platforms, but that can also, hopefully, lead to the development of stronger, more reliable, and ultimately more trustworthy, platforms. However, there are a number of tensions, vulnerabilities and potential conflicts of interest that characterize the platform beat. This article explores these complex dynamics of the platform beat in an effort assess the capacity of those on the platform beat to enhance the accountability and trustworthiness of digital platforms.

N2 - There are two conflicting views about the nature of thought: it is invariably rational or invariably irrational. Bartlett argued that thinking is a high level skill, and this idea suggests an obvious third possibility: thought is sometimes rational and sometimes irrational. This view is defended in the present paper, which argues that the doctrine of logical infallibility is either falsified by the results of some experiments on syllogistic reasoning or else empirically vacuous. There is no need to postulate a mental logic of the sort that Piaget and others have proposed. The rapid implicit inferences of daily life depend on the ability to interpret sentences by constructing mental models of the states of affairs that they describe. Deliberate deductions depend on the further ability to search for alternative models that violate putative conclusions. All that you need to know to assess validity is the fundamental semantic principle of deduction: an inference is valid if, and only if, its conclusion is true in every situation in which its premises are true and there is no way of interpreting the premises so as to render the conclusion false. This principle guides the construction of all logics though it is not explicitly stated in any of them. The paper concludes by examining the ways in which people differ in their ability to reason, the practical need to improve this ability, and some of the pedagogical implications of the present studies.

N2 - With emergent subspecialties like data journalism bringing new skillsets and job roles, professionals and journalism educators find it difficult to imbibe the fast-changing industry demands. Such challenges in some countries and media industries put journalism educators in an advantageous position, offering them an agency to actively shape the contours of industry practice than getting shaped by it. From this perspective, the present study tries to understand data journalism practices in India and suggests certain insights to integrate data journalism training in programmes offered by Indian journalism education. By probing insights from the literature on data journalism education and by examining existing data journalism practices in India, the study calls for intervention with a pedagogic strategy to impart better data-sourcing practices, coding skills and critical data literacy among the students as an antidote to the prevalent DIY culture and overdependence on data aggregates. The pedagogic strategy should convey the importance of audience centrality and ethics in data journalism practice. It argues that such an approach can, in effect, improve industry practices as well as the quality of journalism education in India.

N2 - This scoping review addresses internationally published empirical studies on the subject of technology-enhanced creativity. The study aims to identify the types of technological tools used to enhance students’ creativity and examine how technological tools can support students’ creativity in K-12 music education. This review selected and analyzed 17 studies published from 1987 to 2022 in peer-reviewed journals using a rigorous five-stage scoping framework. Data extraction and analysis were conducted in Covidence. The results revealed eight types of technological tools used to enhance creativity in the music classroom, in which sequencer software and GarageBand were the most commonly used type of technological tools and applications respectively. Technology’s support for creativity was also discussed from the perspectives of Lubart’s four roles of computers: (a) computer as nanny, (b) computer as pen-pal, (c) computer as coach, and (d) computer as colleague. The results showed a dearth of research on how technology can become students’ partners to help them generate creative ideas. Based on the findings, this review concluded with implications and recommendations for future research.

N2 - Abstract Increasing demand from the consumer for higher levels of refinement from their passenger vehicles has put considerable pressure on the automotive industry to produce ever quieter cars. In order to prevent the occurrence of many forms of brake noise, especially judder and drone, excessive heating of the brake disc must be avoided, while minimizing temperature variations across the rotor. In order for this to be achieved the brake rotor must be designed such that it ensures sufficient uniform heat dissipation and thermal capacity. In high-demand braking applications, vented discs consisting of two rubbing surfaces separated by straight radial vanes are normally employed, as they utilize a greater surface area to dissipate heat. Within this paper the effects of changing the geometry of the first row of pins on aerothermo-dynamic properties of a pin-vented brake rotor are investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The validated CFD model shows that decreasing the thickness of the first row of pins by 10 per cent improves the mass flowrate through the rotor by 14 per cent and the heat transfer rate by 6 per cent. The results obtained can be used for the design of brake discs which are efficient with respect to heat dissipation.

N2 - In this article, noise spectrum of marine propellers is investigated in uniform flow under non-cavitating and cavitating conditions. New results are presented for this research field. Hydrodynamic performance of both non-cavitating and cavitating marine propellers is first analyzed by viscous and potential based flow solvers. In viscous solver, sheet cavitation on propeller blades is simulated with Schnerr–Sauer cavitation model based on Rayleigh Plesset equation using volume of fluid approach. Numerical hydrodynamic results based on viscous solver is compared with potential solver and then validated with experimental data of benchmark David Taylor Model Basin 4119 model propeller. Later, noise spectrum of model propellers is predicted by a hybrid method which combines Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes and Ffowcs Williams Hawkings equations. Computed noise spectrum is compared with other numerical studies in the literature for the selected model propeller. In addition, hydrodynamic and hydroacoustic pressures are compared in near field to show reliability of numerical solution. Effects of blade number on hydrodynamic performance and noise spectrum are also investigated. Numerical results indicated that as blade number increases, propeller noise level decreases for different loading conditions due to decreased blade loading (circulation) per blade. However, propeller efficiency increases as blade number decreases.

N2 - The performances of non-seasonal time series models assumed on outlier free series in describing the generating mechanism of an outlier is discussed. The contribution of the magnitude of outliers and bias introduced into these models are investigated. Analytically we have shown that the magnitude of outlier depends on the respective weight of their generating mechanism, although it was found that for an additive outlier model the estimates of outliers gave an unbiased estimate of the actual values observed. For a given innovative model, the first observation, if certified as outlier, has the same magnitude as the actual observed value. The efficiency of the estimates of the outliers varies according to the weights of their generating mechanisms. Analytically, additive model is more efficient for all the generating mechanism if the weights ’s lie within the unit circle. An empirical comparison of the analytical study is considered using three simulated series.

N2 - A theoretical study is presented for predicting the hygrothermal behavior of laminated composite plates during moisture desorption. This investigation is aimed at overcoming the computational difficulties in the determination of transient hygroscopic stress distribution through laminated plates and in the evaluation of the effect of anisotropy on the evolution of such stresses. To calculate such stresses during desorption phase, we present a new method by which we are able to predict directly the evolution of transient hygroscopic stresses within laminated composite plates without the calculation of moisture concentrations as in the case of Benkeddad’s method in which we are obliged to determine the moisture distribution across the plate before the calculation of such stresses. This is very important and must be taken into account in the design of composite material, particularly aerospace structures for example, aircraft. The second part of this investigation is devoted to the analysis of the effect of anisotropy on the hygrothermal behavior of laminated plates during moisture desorption. The polar representation method of anisotropic properties is selected as a convenient tool for this study. By this method, the author is able to assess the anisotropy of composite laminated plates using the degree of anisotropy. Some stacking sequences with different in-plane degree of anisotropy were investigated in order to show the effect of anisotropy on the transverse hygroscopic stresses. Finally, the results of this paper can be used to guide the derivation of future by opening a way for the optimal design of composite structures submitted to a moist environment.

The SCC/NCS (NORAD Computer System) Graphic Display Console must meet specific Air Force readability, look-angle, accessibility, and maintenance requirements, as well as the restrictive space, weight, and power requirements. Both the SCC and NCS display presentations require extensive use of display vectors to construct maps and backgrounds in addition to presenting the data. The problems of legibility require evaluating the advantages of stroke-generation techniques over the raster-scan technology in producing straight, clearly defined vectors. Also, the system requires a highly reliable, modularly expandable, high-throughput system which would apply to both the SCC and NCS man/machine interface requirements. To effectively maintain the display console hardware, it should be identical for both the SCC and NCS segments; however, the segments must be addressable for different functional operations and displayed information. Thus the operational parameters were assigned to software programs. Functions of the SCC include space catalog maintenance, space sensor system status, space weapons support, system control and support, programming support, and personnel subsystem support. To perform these functions within the allowable time constraints, a highly automated and highly interactive computer system is needed. The Human Factors role in console definition, man/computer interface considerations, and facility layout problems will be discussed in the paper.

N2 - Background: Women and people of color are consistently underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields and careers. Though there are myriad factors underlying these gaps, one potential variable may be the extent to which these students feel connected to their STEM classroom experiences. Purpose: The present study investigated the potential of a service-learning experience to support STEM engagement for underrepresented youth. Methodology/Approach: Two cohorts of high school students participated in a summer program through which they built “solar suitcases” to provide electricity for communities in need. Observations and student surveys measured student engagement and changes in STEM attitudes, dispositions, and beliefs. Findings/Conclusions: Students were highly engaged in service-learning activities and demonstrated improved Science Fascination, Science Values, and STEM Career Affinity after participating in the program. Implications: Implications for the design and delivery of culturally relevant service-learning experiences are discussed.

N2 - The debate over symbolic versus sub-symbolic representations of human cognition has been continuing for thirty years, with little indication of a resolution. The argument is this: Does the human cognitive system use symbols as a representation of knowledge, and does it process symbols and their respective constituents? Or does the human cognitive system use a distributed representation of knowledge, and is it somehow capable of processing this distributed representation of knowledge in a complex and meaningful way? This paper argues for an integrated symbolic and sub-symbolic approach to the representation of cognition. The lines of reasoning used as evidence to bolster this argument for an integrated approach are the cognitive architecture the Adaptive Character of Thought-Rational (ACT-R), and biology, where it is argued that symbolic and sub-symbolic representations of cognition are part of an intellectual continuum, with sub-symbolic representations at the low end and symbolic representations at the higher end.

N2 - An engine is being developed to utilise some of the heat of a wood-burning stove to produce a small quantity of electricity. The heat is used to maintain a temperature gradient in a regenerator consisting of very narrow passages in which the gas (air) is in intimate thermal contact with the material. By the thermo-acoustic principle, a strong sound wave can be developed if the regenerator is incorporated in an acoustic loop so that acoustic energy is returned to it and amplified. The excess power generated can be extracted by a linear alternator. This article describes a model of the thermal, acoustic and electrical processes, and a procedure for calculating the performance of a complete loop. Comparison of the computed results with data from three configurations of apparatus shows that the acoustic elements of the problem are quite accurately described. However, there are discrepancies between the calculated thermal and electrical parameters, and the limited measurements for a practically useful arrangement of the components.

N2 - There are two very different approaches to understand functioning of the brain. First, there is a huge progress in the research of the neurological and neurophysiological properties of different brain substructures, circuits, networks, single cells, synapses and their molecular properties. It contributes to the progress of research in the fields of basic medical sciences and the dramatic increase in average life expectancy. On the another side that does not directly follows neurological developments, it is our introspection related to individual ways of thinking in order to solve different problems that also involve human creativity (cognitive theory of mind). We use many diverse ways of thinking, and they depend on different circumstances. Especially interesting are influences of intuition, feelings and emotions on our creativity, which is in a large part are also related to the social interactions (affective empathy). In this work, we formalise emotional scales and transfer of emotions between individuals (social emotional thinking). We also demonstrate a continuity of the emotion transfer mappings, and an importance of the interactions between emotional faces. It is not only human specific to show and to react to face emotions, but strong and wide human social interactions are based on the precise emotional social thinking. By measuring critical values of face deformations that may influence mutual emotions, we can test precision and tolerance of human visual and emotional systems. By introduction indiscernibility relations between individual reading of face parts deformation, we have used rough set theory to probe social emotional thinking. As one of us have demonstrated that the visual system has properties that follows rough set theory (cognitive theory of mind), this work extends this concept to the social emotional interactions (cognitive and affective theory of mind). As in modern world IT - information technology - has became driving factor in the process of globalisation by creating effective channels of information exchange; hence it becomes extremely important to analyse emotional meaning (cognitive empathy) for this vast information flow. By using as described here, rough set theory to determine, which parts of information have significant emotional influence, our model may give grounds to increase the collective well-being.

In the process, it identifies the range of topics that have been historically addressed as a means of suggesting types of possible future articles. It includes both a statement of editorial policies and information about normal selection procedures. This article therefore serves to define the scope of this journal, but fundamentally should be understood as intended to be suggestive, rather than either prescriptive or restrictive. The journal’s essential characteristic is both to act as a complement to the standard disciplinary journals and to be innovative in its acceptance of new ideas and methods.

Drawing on Nguyen’s theory of agential aesthetics, this paper argues that the aesthetic value of a rule is related to the ways in which it contains modalities of agency. Using football’s (soccer) offside rule as a case study, this article provides a way of thinking about the aesthetics of game rules.

N2 - Specific genetic abnormalities (alterations in growth-related genes), either inherited or acquired during lifetimes, may deregulate normal cell growth by interfering with very basic cellular, biochemical and biophysical processes. In order to be able to prevent such unregulated growth of cells, which may lead to cancer, we will have to understand the basic principles of genome organisation better, the mechanisms of genetic information storage, and the molecular structure and functioning of the genes and gene families themselves. This review gives a short overview of the various hierarchical levels at which an attempt is made, using different methods, to collect genomic information relevant to cancer research. We will start with cytogenetic and genetic linkage maps at the lowest resolution, work with ordered clone and complementary DNA libraries and with nucleotide sequences at medium resolution, and investigate fine details of the atomic and electronic structures of the molecules involved at the highest resolution. Very different disciplines – biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, genetics, artificial intelligence research and others – have to cooperate closely in approaching the above-mentioned ambitious goals. One of their common denominators is their intensive use of computers as tools in organising genomic information and in trying to convert it to biological knowledge.

N2 - Computer methods can assist in understanding the behaviour of the individual components of a helmet, beyond merely the headform output as is usually done in a laboratory environment or for test-house certification purposes. This design study uses a method that we have previously used to analyse the effects of helmet liner material properties. While the helmet liner is of vital importance for energy absorption, other design modifications can also serve to improve its performance. The equestrian helmet model previously developed and analysed by the authors was used in this study. The helmet shell and geometric factors, such as a gap between the liner and shell, ventilation holes and ridges on the helmet liner were studied to observe their influence on helmet performance. By studying helmet design variations in terms of different variables other than headform linear acceleration, it is possible to determine which helmet configurations perform better, why they perform the way they do and how efficiently they perform. This can assist the product design and optimization process by suggesting models which would optimize cost, weight and helmet size.

N2 - The debate over symbolic versus sub-symbolic representations of human cognition has been continuing for thirty years, with little indication of a resolution. The argument is this: Does the human cognitive system use symbols as a representation of knowledge, and does it process symbols and their respective constituents? Or does the human cognitive system use a distributed representation of knowledge, and is it somehow capable of processing this distributed representation of knowledge in a complex and meaningful way? This paper argues for an integrated symbolic and sub-symbolic approach to the representation of cognition. The lines of reasoning used as evidence to bolster this argument for an integrated approach are the cognitive architecture the Adaptive Character of Thought-Rational (ACT-R), and biology, where it is argued that symbolic and sub-symbolic representations of cognition are part of an intellectual continuum, with sub-symbolic representations at the low end and symbolic representations at the higher end.

N2 - This study examined political advertisements placed by the Russian-based Internet Research Agency on Facebook and Instagram. Advertisements were computationally analyzed for four rhetorical techniques presumed to elicit anger and fear: negative identity-based language, inflammatory language, obscene language, and threatening language. Congruent with extant research on arousing emotional responses, advertising clickthrough rates were positively associated with inflammatory, obscene, and threatening language. Surprisingly, however, a negative relationship between clickthrough rate and the use of negative identity-based language was observed. Additional analyses showed that the advertisements were engaged with at rates that exceed industry benchmarks, and that clickthrough rates increased over time.

N2 - The flexion effect of a flexible wing during the hovering flight is systematically studied by using computer simulations when Reynolds number is kept at 140. The aerodynamic forces and flow vortex are investigated by solving the two-dimensional time-dependent incompressible Navier–Stokes equations using the finite volume method. The wing is modelled as a thin plate which has a rigid leading portion and a flexible aft part. The simulations are performed for a variation of the location of rotational centre and the amplitude of the flexion, and the corresponding changes of the aerodynamic forces and vortex shedding mechanism in the wake structure are investigated. Form the quantitative comparisons, the present simulations reveal that a moderate flexion during the hovering fly can provide a better performance for a flapping wing, while an excessive flexion will lead the aerodynamic performance become worse. Though the flexion does not change the force trace of the hovering wing, the magnitude of the instantaneous peak forces and mean periodic forces are definitely changed by the chordwise deformation. Compared with a rigid hovering wing, the dynamic flexion during hovering alters the intensity of the leading edge vorticity and the transfer direction of the wake. Here, the present results indicate that the aerodynamic forces can be altered by adding some deformation characteristics to the trailing edge of the wing. Furthermore, the appropriate flexion can be used to alter the aerodynamic performance of a wing and will be helpful for design and control of the flexible microflying vehicles.

N2 - The well-known glove box arrangement used in the nuclear industry maintains a pressure depression within a contaminated volume while allowing passage of a small purge flow to the filtration plant. Conventionally, if a glove tears for example, an electromechanical control system restores the depression by opening and regulating an extra connection to the filtration duct. However, faster response and lower maintenance overheads result from replacing the conventional system with the fluidic vortex amplifier (VA) but coupled ventilation system and VA dynamics can be unstable. Designers needed a tool to predict oscillatory performance and, ideally, to advise on the strengths of influence of network parameters on stability. A system modelling approach is presented in which pipework dynamics, including steady state friction, are presented by transmission line modelling (TLM). A semi-empirical feedback model of linearized VA dynamics has been developed and shown to be substantially correct. The model’s restriction to small signals does not adversely affect investigation of perturbation growth or decay. Partial transmission line representation of the VA model with special measures for feedback allowed time-domain simulations of network perturbations. However, this approach is indirect and it was possible to convert the whole VA model to transmission lines and then reformulate the TLM scheme into a direct, quantitative stability analysis. Extension of the technique provided a means of assessing the sensitivity of the stability to simple network alterations. The method has been programmed on an 80386 PC and successfully used on a large ventilation system. Success in the present context of dynamic stability for fluidic nuclear ventilation networks should be repeatable in other areas since the approach is applicable to any TLM-amenable system, be it fluid, mechanical, electrical or mixed.

N2 - In our systematic mapping study, we examined 289 published works to determine which intelligent computing methods (e.g. Artificial Neural Networks, Machine Learning, and Fuzzy Logic) used by air-conditioning systems can provide energy savings and improve thermal comfort. Our goal was to identify which methods have been used most in research on the topic, which methods of data collection have been employed, and which areas of research have been empirical in nature. We observed the rules for literature reviews in identifying published works on databases (e.g. the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers database, the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, and Wiley Online Library) and classified identified works by topic. After excluding works according to the predefined criteria, we reviewed selected works according to the research parameters motivating our study. Results reveal that energy savings is the most frequently examined topic and that intelligent computing methods can be used to provide better indoor environments for occupants, with energy savings of up to 50%. The most common intelligent method used has been artificial neural networks, while sensors have been the tools most used to collect data, followed by searches of databases of experiments, simulations, and surveys accessed to validate the accuracy of findings.

N2 - It has been noted by many researchers that young bilingual children pass through a stage of early mixing which extends approximately until the age of 2;6 and ends abruptly. Research on bilingual first language acquisition has clearly excluded the possibility to explain mixed utterances as the result of a fused lexical or grammatical system. However, the actual debate on the reasons for early mixing still continues. Two main approaches have dominated the field of language mixing in adults: One assumes that adult’s codeswitching is constrained by grammatical principles, suggesting that a third grammar is responsible for the grammaticality of mixed utterances (e.g., the Equivalence Constraint formulated by Poplack (1980), or the Functional Head Constraint formulated by Belazi, Rubin & Toribio (1994) among others). Since child grammar is supposed to be organized differently from adult grammar, the grammatical “ingredients” of the principles which constrain codeswitching are absent in early child language (Köppe & Meisel, 1995). It therefore follows that early mixing in young bilingual children is not to be considered as constrained by any grammatical principles. The other approach argues that codeswitching in adults is not regulated by external grammatical principles, but that the only constraints which govern codeswitching are those required by the two languages involved (MacSwan, 2000). We will show that this assumption holds for child language as well. Our analysis of mixing opens the perspective that child grammar can be considered to be organized in the same way as adult grammar. Furthermore, we will argue that early mixing is related to developing performance abilities, in the present paper to the readiness on the bilingual child’s part to speak the language(s).

N2 - Psychological experiments on children’s development of spatial knowledge suggest that experience at self-locomotion and visual tracking are important factors. Yet, the mechanism underlying development is unknown. We propose a robot that learns to track a target object mentally (i.e., maintaining a representation of an object’s position when outside the field of view) as a model for spatial development. Mental tracking is considered as prediction of an object’s position, given the previous environmental state and motor commands and the current environment state resulting from movement. Following Jordan and Rumelhart’s (1992) forward modeling architecture, the system consists of two components: an inverse model of sensory input to desired motor commands and a forward model of motor commands to desired sensory input (goals). The robot was tested on the “three cups”paradigm (in which children are required, under various movement conditions, to select the cup containing the hidden object). Consistent with child development, in the absence of the capacity for self-locomotion, the robot makes errors that are self-center-based. When given the ability for self-locomotion, the robot responds allocentrically.

N2 - In an effort to infuse problem-solving activities requiring higher-order thinking into inner-city classrooms, we investigated the use of microcomputers with a graphing application program to teach principles of the design and interpretation of graphs to a population of students with little or no prior knowledge of graphs or data analysis. This is an exploratory, naturalistic research study of students’ thoughts and behavior in this context. It differs from most earlier work in the field of computer-assisted graphing in three major ways: first, we focus broadly on a wide variety of types of graphs, used in several different subject matter contexts; second, we conduct research into problem solving processes in an unmodified whole-classroom environment; third, we supplement participant observations on student cognition with extensive behavioral sequence data gathered automatically and unobtrusively by the computer. We detail our attempts to develop, adapt, and apply quantitative methods of analysis of behavioral sequences which are potentially applicable to such data gathered for a large number of students.

N2 - This paper describes a Group Decision Support System for cooperative or non‐cooperative argumentative discourses. The system provides agents means of expressing and weighing their individual arguments and preferences, in order to argue for or against the selection of a certain choice. It supports defeasible and qualitative reasoning in the presence of ill‐structured information. Argumentation is performed through a set of discourse acts which call a variety of procedures for the propagation of information in the corresponding discussion graph. The system incorporates Case Based Reasoning to resolve current issues by using previous similar situations. Cases are not mere representations of past data, but flexible entities associated with the underlying viewpoint of an agent and the evolution of the corresponding discussion. The paper provides an object‐oriented description of the elements involved, and illustrates their dependencies through a comprehensive example.

N2 - The Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT) is the most widely used norm-referenced creativity test used in gifted identification. Although commonly used for identifying talent, little is known about how creativity tests, like the TTCT-Figural, contribute to the probability of being identified as gifted especially with underrepresented populations. Using nominated students (n = 1,191) from a diverse midsized urban school district, this study examined the differential predictive validity among student demographics (i.e., race/ethnicity, free/reduced price lunch status, English learning status, sex) and the TTCT-Figural to the probability of being identified as gifted. Results of a multilevel hierarchical generalized linear regression indicated underrepresented groups showed no difference in the probability of being identified after controlling for cognitive ability and academic achievement; the same was true when the TTCT-Figural was included within the model. The inclusion of the TTCT-Figural does contribute to the probability of identification; however, the disproportionality of underrepresented student groups remains in this school district. Gifted administrators looking to enhance equity may not find the solution with the mere inclusion of a creativity assessment. Implications for practice and future directions are discussed.

N2 - Concrete in transportation infrastructure is constantly subjected to the ingress of chloride, which could cause reinforcement corrosion and significant deterioration of concrete structures if not well controlled. Major types of reinforcement corrosion, such as pitting corrosion and concentration-cell corrosion, are usually initiated with localized chloride concentrations whose behavior is closely related to the transport characteristics of chloride ions in hydrated cement paste. However, unless studied at the molecular level, chloride transport behavior cannot be properly understood and controlled in view of the high heterogeneity of cement paste. The findings are presented from a research study recently conducted with a molecular dynamics (MD) approach to investigate the physicochemical nature of the various interactions between chloride ions and cement hydration products, which might significantly influence chloride transport in cement paste. Six hydrated compounds including portlandite, C-S-H phases (tobermorite and jennite), AFm phases (hydrocalumite and kuzelite), and the AFt phase (ettringite) were modeled and then validated by using the 35Cl nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy technique. On the basis of the MD-generated ionic trajectory, the macroscopic transport phenomenon of chloride species was evaluated in the vicinity of each different hydration product in terms of a computed effective diffusion coefficient.

N2 - A framework for thinking about teacher empowerment is presented. Two important dimensions are used as a basis for highlighting some important similarities and differences emerging in the literature on empowerment. The first relates to the context in which the process occurs; some educators highlight the importance of the personal context (i.e., conversations with self), while others assume more of an outward perspective in their thinking about empowerment (i.e., conversations with settings). The second important dimension relates to the focus or agenda of the conversations. Here, a distinction is made between agendas that are more epistemological in nature and those that are more political. An illustration is provided of how this framework can be used to better understand the dynamics involved in collaborative work with teachers.

N2 - One feature that characterizes the organization and delivery of health care is its inherent complexity. All too often, with so much information and so many activities involved, it is difficult for decision-makers to determine in an objective fashion an appropriate course of action. It would appear that a holistic rather than a reductionist approach would be advantageous. The aim of this paper is to review how formal systems thinking can aid decision-making in complex situations. Consideration is given as to how the use of a number of systems modelling methodologies can help in gaining an understanding of a complex decision situation. This in turn can enhance the possibility of a decision being made in a more rational, explicit and transparent fashion. The arguments and approaches are illustrated using examples taken from the public health arena.

N2 - With the continuous development of physical education technology, more modern technologies and diversified teaching concepts are being introduced into football teaching. In response to the issue of interactive football teaching puzzle games, this study designs an interactive technology that integrates Virtual Reality. A technical framework containing multiple information processing modules is constructed, and the Two Stream algorithm is used as the main body of the network framework. Action information collection and analysis are utilized to generate interactive instructions. In the analysis of training speed, the loss value of the research method decreased rapidly and reached its lowest value at the 58th iteration; in the cache data generation test, the research method did not exceed 376Mb of cache data at the 12th minute of operation. When analyzing the accuracy of interactive action recognition, the research method achieved the highest accuracy of around 0.87 in open outdoor and indoor scenes when the action duration reached 1500 ms. The research method has higher interaction quality and efficiency, which can provide technical support for information-based physical education teaching and game interaction, and provide more diversified technical means for football teaching.

N2 - Comminution and classification are the two major unit operations involved in the processing of pure minerals from its ore rocks. In the current paper, an assessment is made on different numerical models used for the prediction of fluid and solid flow properties in tumbling mill, hydrocyclone and dense medium cyclone (DMC). A detailed discussion on the selection of suitable turbulence and multiphase models for the accurate prediction of flow field in hydrocyclone is made by comparing the predictions among and against experimental data. The additional requirements for accurate performance predictions at high feed solid content is elaborated. The drawbacks of DPM model and the usage of CFD-DEM coupling technique to predict the coal partition curve in DMC’s has been elucidated. The discrepancies between DEM, CFD, one way and two way coupled CFD-DEM predicted mean flow field and particle dynamics against experimental measurements in tumbling mills also made in detail.

N2 - In elasticity, microstructure-related deviations may be modeled by strain gradient elasticity. For so-called metamaterials, different implementations are possible for solving strain gradient elasticity problems numerically. Analytical solutions of simple problems are used to verify the numerical approach. We demonstrate such a case in a two-dimensional continuum as a benchmark case for computations. As strain gradient enforces higher regularity conditions in displacements, in the finite element method (FEM), the use of standard elements is often seen as inadequate. For such piecewise or elementwise continuous elements, we examine a possible remedy to correctly simulate strain gradient elasticity problems by implementing two techniques. First, we enforce continuity of displacement gradient across elements; second, we employ a mixed finite element method where displacement and its gradient are solved both as unknowns. The results show the pros and cons of each numerical technique. All methods converge monotonically, but the mixed method is more reliable than the other one.

N2 - This paper addresses a dynamic vehicle routing problem related to courier mail services with explicit consideration of multiple objectives. This problem is modeled as a dynamic traveling repairman problem with time windows, and with three objectives considered: maximization of the number of serviced customers, minimization of customer waiting, and minimization of total travel time. A solution (simulation) framework, extending techniques developed for single-objective dynamic routing problems in the literature, is proposed to tackle this multiobjective problem. An efficient chained local search heuristic is embedded in this solution framework to solve the underlying static problem, the traveling salesman problem with time windows. Comprehensive simulation experiments conducted on data sets derived from benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithmic approach is able to provide high-quality solutions with limited computing effort. These experiments also indicate that the multiobjective model proposed in this study can offer much more attractive solutions to decision makers than single-objective models.

N2 - In the fields of architecture and urban design, there has always been a delay in the impact of industrial revolution technologies, and in the case of less industrialised countries, the delay has been even bigger. This article starts with a review of the history of computer-aided architectural design in Brazil and then describes the state of the field in some Latin American countries. Finally, we discuss the ‘ideal computer curriculum’ for architects in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

N2 - One feature that characterizes the organization and delivery of health care is its inherent complexity. All too often, with so much information and so many activities involved, it is difficult for decision-makers to determine in an objective fashion an appropriate course of action. It would appear that a holistic rather than a reductionist approach would be advantageous. The aim of this paper is to review how formal systems thinking can aid decision-making in complex situations. Consideration is given as to how the use of a number of systems modelling methodologies can help in gaining an understanding of a complex decision situation. This in turn can enhance the possibility of a decision being made in a more rational, explicit and transparent fashion. The arguments and approaches are illustrated using examples taken from the public health arena.

N2 - A conceptual model of the human haptic system in relation to object identification is presented. The model encompasses major architectural elements including representations of haptically accessible object properties and exploratory procedures (EPs)—dedicated movement patterns that are specialized to extract particular properties. These architectural units are related in processing-specific ways. Properties are associated with exploratory procedures in keeping with the extent to which a given procedure delivers information about a given property. The EPs are associated with one another in keeping with their compatibility, as determined by parameters of motor execution and interactions with the object and the workspace. The resulting architecture is treated as a system of constraints which guide the exploration of an object during the course of identification. The selection of the next step in a sequence of exploration requires that constraints be optimally satisfied. A network approach to constraint satisfaction is implemented and shown to account for a number of previous empirical results concerning the time course of exploration, object classification speed, and incidental learning about object properties. This system has potential applications for robotic haptic exploration.

N2 - With the continuous development of physical education technology, more modern technologies and diversified teaching concepts are being introduced into football teaching. In response to the issue of interactive football teaching puzzle games, this study designs an interactive technology that integrates Virtual Reality. A technical framework containing multiple information processing modules is constructed, and the Two Stream algorithm is used as the main body of the network framework. Action information collection and analysis are utilized to generate interactive instructions. In the analysis of training speed, the loss value of the research method decreased rapidly and reached its lowest value at the 58th iteration; in the cache data generation test, the research method did not exceed 376Mb of cache data at the 12th minute of operation. When analyzing the accuracy of interactive action recognition, the research method achieved the highest accuracy of around 0.87 in open outdoor and indoor scenes when the action duration reached 1500 ms. The research method has higher interaction quality and efficiency, which can provide technical support for information-based physical education teaching and game interaction, and provide more diversified technical means for football teaching.

N2 - Comminution and classification are the two major unit operations involved in the processing of pure minerals from its ore rocks. In the current paper, an assessment is made on different numerical models used for the prediction of fluid and solid flow properties in tumbling mill, hydrocyclone and dense medium cyclone (DMC). A detailed discussion on the selection of suitable turbulence and multiphase models for the accurate prediction of flow field in hydrocyclone is made by comparing the predictions among and against experimental data. The additional requirements for accurate performance predictions at high feed solid content is elaborated. The drawbacks of DPM model and the usage of CFD-DEM coupling technique to predict the coal partition curve in DMC’s has been elucidated. The discrepancies between DEM, CFD, one way and two way coupled CFD-DEM predicted mean flow field and particle dynamics against experimental measurements in tumbling mills also made in detail.

N2 - Background: The most important hallmark in the neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the formation of amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrils due to the misfolding/aggregation of the Aβ peptide. Preventing or reverting the aggregation process has been an active area of research. Naturally occurring products are a potential source of molecules that may be able to inhibit Aβ42 peptide aggregation. Recently, we and others reported the anti-aggregating properties of curcumin and some of its derivatives in vitro, presenting an important therapeutic avenue by enhancing these properties. Objective: To computationally assess the interaction between Aβ peptide and a set of curcumin derivatives previously explored in experimental assays. Methods: The interactions of ten ligands with Aβ monomers were studied by combining molecular dynamics and molecular docking simulations. We present the in silico evaluation of the interaction between these derivatives and the Aβ42 peptide, both in the monomeric and fibril forms. Results: The results show that a single substitution in curcumin could significantly enhance the interaction between the derivatives and the Aβ42 monomers when compared to a double substitution. In addition, the molecular docking simulations showed that the interaction between the curcumin derivatives and the Aβ42 monomers occur in a region critical for peptide aggregation. Conclusion: Results showed that a single substitution in curcumin improved the interaction of the ligands with the Aβ monomer more so than a double substitution. Our molecular docking studies thus provide important insights for further developing/validating novel curcumin-derived molecules with high therapeutic potential for AD.

N2 - Through the recent technological developments within the fourth industrial revolution, artificial intelligence (AI) studies have had a huge impact on various disciplines such as social sciences, information communication technologies (ICTs), architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC). Regarding decision-making and forecasting systems in particular, AI and machine learning (ML) technologies have provided an opportunity to improve the mutual relationships between machines and humans. When the connection between ML and architecture is considered, it is possible to claim that there is no parallel acceleration as in other disciplines. In this study, and considering the latest breakthroughs, we focus on revealing what ML and architecture have in common. Our focal point is to reveal common points by classifying and analyzing current literature through describing the potential of ML in architecture. Studies conducted using ML techniques and subsets of AI technologies were used in this paper, and the resulting data were interpreted using the bibliometric analysis method. In order to discuss the state-of-the-art research articles which have been published between 2014 and 2020, main subjects, subsets, and keywords were refined through the search engines. The statistical figures were demonstrated as huge datasets, and the results were clearly delineated through Sankey diagrams. Thanks to bibliometric analyses of the current literature of WOS (Web of Science), CUMINCAD (Cumulative Index about publications in Computer Aided Architectural Design supported by the sibling associations ACADIA, CAADRIA, eCAADe, SIGraDi, ASCAAD, and CAAD futures), predictable data have been presented allowing recommendations for possible future studies for researchers.

N2 - Modeling an intelligent adversary has provided great challenges to simulated training realism. Traditional approaches to modeling have relied on rule-based and analytical decision-making models in an attempt to optimize the decision making of an intelligent computer-generated adversary. In order to promote realistic transfer of training in the realm of command and control, the trainee must experience realistic decision-making behavior in the enemy. This means that the enemy must make realistic decisions based on environmental constraints, goals, and intent. The enemy’s decisions must then be reflected by the simulated agents. The Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD) Model is a descriptive model of expert decision making in real-world settings. We have several related projects where the goal is to translate the conceptual RPD Model into a computer model that can simulate realistic expert decision making. In attempting this feat, we have discovered many valuable lessons about modeling cognition and decision making, and about the assumptions and mechanisms underlying the RPD Model. The purpose of this paper is to report those findings.

Other first grade teachers (n = 20) were assigned randomly to a control group. Although instructional practices were not prescribed, experimental teachers taught problem solving significantly more and number facts significantly less than did control teachers. Experimental teachers encouraged students to use a variety of problem-solving strategies, and they listened to processes their students used significantly more than did control teachers. Experimental teachers knew more about individual students’ problem-solving processes, and they believed that instruction should build on students’ existing knowledge more than did control teachers. Students in experimental classes exceeded students in control classes in number fact knowledge, problem solving, reported understanding, and reported confidence in their problem-solving abilities.

N2 - This study reflects on Harold Kincaid and Jule Zahle’s view that there is no necessary association between methodological individualism and agent-based models because the analysis of social phenomena in terms of the latter cannot always be regarded as an implementation of the former. Their view remains in contention with the standpoint of several philosophers of science and social scientists, including Chen and Di Iorio. Kincaid and Zahle’s main argument against such a standpoint is that agent-based simulation is compatible with holistic explanations that are at odds with methodological individualism. The following study argues that Kincaid and Zahle’s conclusion remains untenable since it stems from inaccurate historical assumptions concerning the tradition of methodological individualism and the way the individualism-holism debate is understood within this tradition.

N2 - Critical thinking about international politics often involves reasoning about the beliefs, goals, appraisals, actions, and plans of actors such as countries, governments, politicians, etc. We analyzed arguments in interpretive reports about international politics, in order to develop a prototype argument diagramming tool for this domain, AVIZE (Argument Visualization and Evaluation). The purpose of AVIZE is to aid users in the construction and self-evaluation of real-world arguments in the domain of international politics. AVIZE provides a set of argument schemes as cognitive building blocks for constructing argument diagrams. Most of the schemes are related to concepts from the field of automated plan recognition in artificial intelligence. While some currently available argument diagramming tools provide schemes, they are not tailored to the domain of international politics. This paper describes the argument schemes for this domain and the design of the argument diagramming tool.

N2 - In this study, solid Scots pine was surface densified in an open press using different moisture contents (9·6 and 12·4%), temperatures (150 and 200°C), press closing times (0·5 and 5 min), holding times (1 and 10 min) and compression ratios (6·7 and 25%). The characteristics of the formed density profiles were defined and their correlations to the process parameters and Brinell hardness and elastic recovery were analysed. Compression ratio and closing time had the strongest effect on the formation of the density profile, as well as the hardness and elastic recovery. The amount of localised deformation (peak area) did not have significant effect on the Brinell hardness or elastic recovery, whereas, the highest density achieved (peak density) and its location (peak distance) dominated the effect. Brinell hardness and elastic recovery were found to correlate well with each other.

N2 - Trustworthy-looking faces are also perceived as more attractive, but are there other meaningful cues that contribute to perceived trustworthiness? Using data-driven models, we identify these cues after removing attractiveness cues. In Experiment 1, we show that both judgments of trustworthiness and attractiveness of faces manipulated by a model of perceived trustworthiness change in the same direction. To control for the effect of attractiveness, we build two new models of perceived trustworthiness: a subtraction model, which forces the perceived attractiveness and trustworthiness to be negatively correlated (Experiment 2), and an orthogonal model, which reduces their correlation (Experiment 3). In both experiments, faces manipulated to appear more trustworthy were indeed perceived to be more trustworthy, but not more attractive. Importantly, in both experiments, these faces were also perceived as more approachable and with more positive expressions, as indicated by both judgments and machine learning algorithms. The current studies show that the visual cues used for trustworthiness and attractiveness judgments can be separated, and that apparent approachability and facial emotion are driving trustworthiness judgments and possibly general valence evaluation.

N2 - This study investigated teachers’ use of knowledge from research on children’s mathematical thinking and how their students’ achievement is influenced as a result. Twenty first grade teachers, assigned randomly to an experimental treatment, participated in a month-long workshop in which they studied a research-based analysis of children’s development of problem-solving skills in addition and subtraction. Other first grade teachers (n = 20) were assigned randomly to a control group. Although instructional practices were not prescribed, experimental teachers taught problem solving significantly more and number facts significantly less than did control teachers. Experimental teachers encouraged students to use a variety of problem-solving strategies, and they listened to processes their students used significantly more than did control teachers. Experimental teachers knew more about individual students’ problem-solving processes, and they believed that instruction should build on students’ existing knowledge more than did control teachers. Students in experimental classes exceeded students in control classes in number fact knowledge, problem solving, reported understanding, and reported confidence in their problem-solving abilities.

N2 - The Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 mandates that English language proficiency (ELP) standards align with content standards. As the fast-growing population of English learners (ELs) is expected to meet college- and career-ready content standards, the purpose of this article is to highlight key issues in aligning ELP standards with content standards. The overarching question is how to align ELP standards with academically rigorous and language-intensive disciplinary practices of content standards while respecting and maintaining the nature of the discipline within each area. I begin by describing contributions and shortcomings of content standards and ELP standards. Next, I propose consideration of three components in aligning ELP standards with content standards: (a) norms of disciplinary practices across content areas, (b) developmental progressions of disciplinary practices across K–12 grade levels or bands and across content areas, and (c) language use across levels of English proficiency. For each component, the challenges in establishing alignment and potential trade-offs in addressing these challenges are discussed. Finally, I highlight how these challenges present opportunities for substantive collaboration between EL education and content areas to move these fields forward and ensure ELs achieve academically rigorous content standards while developing ELP.

N2 - Background: Mobile devices have been impacting on human standard of living by providing timely and accurate information anywhere and anytime through wireless media in developing nations. Shortage of experts in medical fields is very obvious throughout the whole world but more pronounced in developing nations. Objective: Thus, this study proposes a telemedicine platform for the vulnerable areas of developing nations. The vulnerable area are the interior with little or no medical facilities, hence the dwellers are very susceptible to sicknesses and diseases. Methods: The framework uses mobile devices that can run LightWeight Agents (LWAs) to send consultation requests to a remote medical expert in urban city from the vulnerable interiors. The feedback is conveyed to the requester through the same medium. The system architecture which contained AgenRoller, LWAs, The front-end (mobile devices) and back-end (the medical server) is presented. The algorithm for the software component of the architecture (AgenRoller) is also presented. The system is modeled as M/M/1/c queuing system, and simulated using Simevents from MATLAB Simulink environment. Result: The simulation result presented show the average queue length, the number of entities in the queue and the number of entities departure from the system. These together present the rate of information processing in the system. Conclusion: A full scale development of this system with proper implementation will help extend the few medical facilities available in the urban cities in developing nations to the interiors thereby reducing the number of casualties in the vulnerable areas of the developing world especially in Sub Saharan Africa.

N2 - Recent work by Amso and Johnson (Developmental Psychology, 42(6), 1236—1245, 2006) implicates the role of visual selective attention in the development of perceptual completion during early infancy. In the current article, we extend this finding by simulating the performance of 3-month-old infants on a visual search task, using a multi-channel, image-filtering model of early visual processing. Model parameters were systematically varied to simulate developmental change in three neural components of visual selective attention: degree of oculomotor noise, growth of horizontal connections in visual cortex, and duration of recurrent processing in parietal cortex. While two of the three components—horizontal connections and recurrent parietal processing—are each able to account for the visual search performance of 3-month-olds, recurrent parietal processing also suggests a coherent pattern of developmental change in visual selective attention during early infancy. We conclude by highlighting plausible neural mechanisms for modulating recurrent parietal activity, including the development of feedback from prefrontal cortex.

N2 - The purpose of the present study was to examine and compare Singaporean physical education teachers’ attitudes towards information and communication technologies in physical education across different demographic groups that included gender, age, teaching experience, and school level. A total of 422 Singaporean full-time physical education teachers (mean age = 38.47 years, standard deviation = 8.31) completed the Physical Education Teachers’ Subjective Theories Questionnaire to assess their perspectives towards the integration of information and communication technologies into physical education teaching practice. Mann–Whitney U and Kruskal–Wallis H tests were conducted to examine the differences in participants’ attitudes across different demographic groups. Results revealed that attitudes towards information and communication technologies significantly differed between teachers of different gender, age, and teaching experience. However, no significant difference was found in attitudes towards information and communication technologies among teachers of different school levels. The findings of this study can inform policy-makers and stakeholders with an interest in promoting the integration of information and communication technologies in physical education.

N2 - This article introduces a generative model of category representation that uses computer vision methods to extract category-consistent features (CCFs) directly from images of category exemplars. The model was trained on 4,800 images of common objects, and CCFs were obtained for 68 categories spanning subordinate, basic, and superordinate levels in a category hierarchy. When participants searched for these same categories, targets cued at the subordinate level were preferentially fixated, but fixated targets were verified faster when they followed a basic-level cue. The subordinate-level advantage in guidance is explained by the number of target-category CCFs, a measure of category specificity that decreases with movement up the category hierarchy. The basic-level advantage in verification is explained by multiplying the number of CCFs by sibling distance, a measure of category distinctiveness. With this model, the visual representations of real-world object categories, each learned from the vast numbers of image exemplars accumulated throughout everyday experience, can finally be studied.

N2 - Numerical techniques for the calculation of velocity and temperature distributions in heated ducts have proved accurate but expensive in computer time and capacity. It is worth investigating to what extent simplification is possible without loss of accuracy. Entry-length heat transfer to upward laminar flow with combined convection in a vertical tube is taken as typical. Comparison is made between measured values and, first, a full numerical solution for constant thermophysical properties (viscosity and thermal diffusivity), secondly, the same solution but allowing for their individual and combined variation with temperature and, thirdly, a solution which assumes a series of truncated versions of the fully developed temperature distribution to establish corresponding velocity profiles, allowing for temperature-dependent properties.

N2 - Abstract The parameter identification of magnetorheological dampers by an inverse method is proposed. A modified Bouc-Wen modified dynamic model is considered and its parameters are obtained by using genetic algorithms. The experimental data consist of time histories of current, displacement, velocity, and force measured for both constant and variable current. The model parameters are determined using a set of experimental measurements corresponding to different constant current values and the resulting model is validated on the data measured for variable current. Based on this model a semi-active control of vehicle suspension is studied and a fuzzy controller is developed to reduce the chattering effect.

N2 - The nonlinear behavior of a high-temperature metal-matrix composite (HT-MMC) was simulated by using the METCAN (Metal Matrix Composite Analyzer) computer code. The simulation started with the fabrication process, proceeded to thermo mechanical cyclic loading, and ended with the application of a monotonic load. Classical laminate theory and composite micromechanics and macromechanics are used in MET CAN, along with a multifactor interaction model for the constituents’ behavior. The simu lation of the stress-strain behavior from the macromechanical and the micromechanical points of view, as well as the initiation and final failure of the constituents and the plies in the composite, was examined in detail. It was shown that, when the fibers and the matrix were perfectly bonded, the fracture started in the matrix and then propagated with increas ing load to the fibers. After the fibers fractured, the composite lost its capacity to carry ad ditional load and fractured.

N2 - Effect sizes are critical to result interpretation and synthesis across studies. Although statistical significance testing has historically dominated the determination of result importance, modern views emphasize the role of effect sizes and confidence intervals. This article accessibly discusses how to calculate and interpret the effect sizes that counseling psychologists use most frequently. To provide context, the author presents a brief history of statistical significance tests. Second, the author discusses the difference between statistical, practical, and clinical significance. Third, the author reviews and graphically demonstrates two common types of effect sizes, commenting on multivariate and corrected effect sizes. Fourth, the author emphasizes meta-analytic thinking and the potential role of confidence intervals around effect sizes. Finally, the author gives a hypothetical example of how to report and potentially interpret some effect sizes.

N2 - This article is concerned with the electromechanically coupled multiscale behaviors of the heterogeneous piezoelectric materials, which consist of periodic or non-periodic distributed microstructures. A multiscale framework based on the extended multiscale finite element method is developed to capture the large-scale solutions on the coarse-scale mesh without resolving the entire small-scale features. In this method, the microscale fluctuations in the mechanical displacement and electrical potential are related to the macroscopic deformation and electrical fields through the multiscale base functions. To improve the accuracy of the multiscale method, the periodic boundary conditions are developed to calculate the multiscale base functions for those piezoelectric structures composed of periodic microstructures. Moreover, the oversampling techniques are introduced to derive the oscillatory boundary conditions to construct the base functions for those piezoelectric structures with non-periodic heterogeneous microscopic features. The efficiency and accuracy of the multiscale method proposed for the piezoelectric materials are validated through the examples where the structures consist of periodic or non-periodic heterogeneous microstructures. The results indicate that the multiscale method developed can effectively obtain the macroscale response of piezoelectric materials (displacement or electrical potential) as well as the response in the microscale (stress or electrical displacement).

Our approach to the work is heavily based on empirical research. We have performed a set of meta-analyses 1) to identify the quantitative effects of poor sleep on task accuracy and task completion time, and 2) to develop a model of operator task selection during multitasking. We are currently developing a model, based on a literature review, to predict the effects of automation design factors on operator task performance. This paper gives an overview of the project, presents the overall model of operator performance during a workload transition, and describes the empirical and theoretical underpinnings of a model that predicts the effects of automation design on operator performance.

N2 - This ethnographic case investigates the relationship between the daily organizing work of one education technology “intermediary organization” (IO) in Silicon Valley, California and federal education technology policies. I argue that the IO constructed policy knowledge that reified discourses of “digital meritocracy”: a belief in digital technologies as a means of evaluating individual success, regardless of historic, place-based material inequities. To develop this concept, I trace themes of “personalization” and “everywhere” as they emerge in the IO’s daily work and in federal education technology policies. This study extends research on IOs as “brokers” of information, resources, and social ties between public schools and private service providers and argues that IOs also construct “policy knowledge,” or “definitions of what counts as education.”

N2 - The prediction of wave resistance in naval architecture is an important aspect especially at high Froude numbers where a great percentage of total resistance of ships and submerged bodies is caused by waves. In addition, during hull form optimization, wave resistance characteristics of a ship must closely be observed. There are potential, viscous and experimental methods to determine the wave resistance of a ship. Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equation–based methods usually follow the experimental method that determines the form factor first. However, it is proven in recent studies that the form factor changes with the Reynolds number. As the Reynolds number increases, this change in the form factor is being neglected. In this study, a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equation–based prediction of wave resistance is presented that overcomes this flaw. The methodology is validated with the benchmark problems of submerged and surface-piercing bodies to determine the effectiveness of the proposed method. The method is also validated by experiments carried out at the Ata Nutku Ship Model Testing Laboratory of Istanbul Technical University for a totally submerged ellipsoid and the benchmark KRISO Containership. Results reveal the robustness of the present methodology.

N2 - In this paper, an outline of mean-field homogenization and fracture toughness of boron nitride nanotube-reinforced aluminium and epoxy composites have been presented. The meso-scale material modelling has been achieved using Mori-Tanaka and double inclusion homogenization schemes. To examine the effectiveness of Mori-Tanaka and double inclusion schemes, a comparison has been drawn with the rule of mixture. Meso-scale numerical results of boron nitride nanotube-reinforced aluminium and epoxy composites are presented for various design parameters such as aspect ratio and volume fraction of boron nitride nanotubes. The validation studies of the developed transversely isotropic composites model have been documented with the experiments performed and existing literature. Finally, macro-scale fracture toughness simulations incorporating the transversely isotropic properties have been performed using the domain integral method. It is observed that aluminium and epoxy with elastoplastic and viscoelastic nature, respectively, have shown a significant effect on the fracture properties of the composites.

N2 - Continuum damage mechanics models have been used for predicting failure in composites for several years now. However, their application to natural fibre composites is quite recent. In this work, an approach for evaluating damage processes in natural fibre composite has been developed by combining experimentally quantified damage rules with discrete representations of fabric geometry. This approach is demonstrated by predicting the tensile failure of both thermoplastic-based and thermoset-based flax fabric composites. Numerical models have been developed to estimate the damage rules from the fibre, matrix and interface properties incorporated into representative volume element (RVE) models of the composites. While both the experimentally quantified and numerically obtained sets of damage rules yield satisfactory predictions, the use of these numerical rules leads to predictions that are close to, and in some cases, better than those obtained from the quantified rules.

N2 - Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the rheolytic effects of stenting a mid-shaft/distal left main coronary artery (LMCA) lesion with and without ostial coverage. Stenting of the LMCA has emerged as a valid alternative in place of traditional coronary bypass graft surgery. However, in case of mid-shaft/distal lesion, there is no consensus regarding the extension of the strut coverage up to the ostium or to stent only the culprit lesion. Methods We reconstructed a left main-left descending coronary artery (LM-LCA)-left circumflex (LCX) bifurcation after analysing 100 consecutive patients (mean age 71.4 ± 9.3, 49 males) with LM mid-shaft/distal disease. The mean diameter of proximal LM, left anterior descending (LAD) and LCX, evaluated with quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) was 4.62 ± 0.86 mm, 3.31 ± 0.92 mm, and 2.74 ± 0.93 mm, respectively. For the stent simulation, a third-generation, everolimus-eluting stent was virtually reconstructed. Results After virtual stenting, the net area averaged wall shear stress (WSS) of the model and the WSS at the LCA-LCX bifurcation resulted higher when the stent covered the culprit mid-shaft lesion only compared with the extension of the stent covering the ostium (3.68 versus 2.06 Pa, p = 0.01 and 3.97 versus 1.98 Pa, p < 0.001, respectively. Similarly, the static pressure and the Reynolds number were significantly higher after stent implantation covering up the ostium. At the ostium, the flow resulted more laminar when stenting only the mid-shaft lesion than including the ostium. Conclusions Although these findings cannot be translated directly into real practice our brief study suggests that stenting lesion 1:1 or extending the stent to cover the LM ostium impacts differently the rheolytic properties of LMCA bifurcation with potential insights for restenosis or thrombosis.

N2 - Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the rheolytic effects of stenting a mid-shaft/distal left main coronary artery (LMCA) lesion with and without ostial coverage. Stenting of the LMCA has emerged as a valid alternative in place of traditional coronary bypass graft surgery. However, in case of mid-shaft/distal lesion, there is no consensus regarding the extension of the strut coverage up to the ostium or to stent only the culprit lesion.

When such studies are undertaken in a closed wave-tank reflections from the boundaries can be troublesome. To this end a cepstral analysis has been attempted on wave-height measurements to locate and assess these reflections. The auto-regressive power-spectral estimate has been used to obtain the cepstrum with some success and the results are compared with those obtained by more conventional data processing methods.

N2 - Credit default has always been one of the critical factors in the development of personal credit business. By establishing a default identification model, default can be avoided effectively. There are some existing methods to identify credit default. However, these methods have some problems: Problem (1): It is different to deal the non-linear data, Problem (2): The local stagnation results in the high error rate, and Problem (3): The premature convergence leads to the low classification rate. In this paper, the sinhTSA-MLP default risk identification model is proposed to solve these problems. In this model, the proposed sinhTSA method can effectively avoid the problems of falling into local optimum and premature convergence. And the benchmark test results demonstrate sinhTSA is superior to other methods. According to the two experiments, the classification rate reaches 77.35% and 96.48%. Therefore, the sinhTSA-MLP default identification model has some particular advantages in identifying credit problems The feasibility of the sinhTSA-MLP default identification model has been proved through helping to manage credit default more consciously.

Results include analytical and numerical investigations of the behavior of piezoelectric ceramics. The model is based on physical mechanisms and includes elastic, dielectric, and piezoelectric anisotropy. Moreover, the model is based on an internal energy approach so that work-energy relations may be directly applied. Results from the model give insight into material behavior.

N2 - It is generally expected that the hydrogen bond strength in a D–H•••A adduct is predicted by the difference between the proton affinities (ΔPA) of D and A, measured by the adduct stabilization, and demonstrated by the infrared (IR) redshift of the D–H bond stretching vibrational frequency. These criteria do not always yield consistent predictions, as illustrated by the hydrogen bonds formed by the E and Z OH groups of protonated carboxylic acids. The ΔPA and the stabilization of a series of hydrogen bonded adducts indicate that the E OH group forms the stronger hydrogen bonds, whereas the bond length changes and the redshift favor the Z OH group, matching the results of NBO and AIM calculations. This reflects that the thermochemistry of adduct formation is not a good measure of the hydrogen bond strength in charged adducts, and that the ionic interactions in the E and Z adducts of protonated carboxylic acids are different. The OH bond length and IR redshift afford the better measure of hydrogen bond strength.

N2 - In this study, the corrosion behavior of biodegradable composites is modeled. These composites are made of Poly-Lactic acid and Magnesium with different volume fractions. The scanning electron microscopy images of these composites were taken, and statistical reconstruction of the composite based on scanning electron microscopy images was done by the phase recovery algorithm, the three-dimensional structure of this composite was extracted with this reconstruction, then a three-dimensional cellular automata model was developed to predict the corrosion of this composite. Results of experiments for the composite with 10% of Magnesium volume fraction were used to calibrate the parameters of the cellular automata model, and with these parameters, the results for the composite with 5% of Magnesium volume fraction was obtained, and with comparing these data with the results of the experiment, our model was validated. In the end, we estimated the mechanical properties of these composites and analyzed the results.

N2 - Experimental characterization of time-dependent properties for rectangular hollowcored, continuous fiber reinforced, commingled recycled plastic extruded forms under long-term (creep) flexural loading has been presented in this paper. Finite element based computer models have been developed to predict the effects of damage progression in such reinforced extruded plastic forms. In the long-term (creep) tests, reinforced and unreinforced extrusions with varying compositions were used as specimens. These extruded specimens were submerged in heated water and subjected to different loads. Experimental results indicate that fiber micro-buckling and fiber–matrix interface failure occur during the creep loading environment. The fiber micro-buckling occurs over time, compared with similar but dramatic damage that occurs in a short-period of time during short-term (static) loading, as discussed in Part I of this work. Experimental data also shows that these damage modes significantly reduce the long-term (life cycle) flexural properties, and the specimens with a coupling agent demonstrated much better performance. “Damage dependent” finite element models were developed using different material property types to represent the glass-fiber roving, fiber–matrix interface and plastic matrix respectively. Material nonlinearity of the plastic matrix has been incorporated along with stress-based failure criteria to account for fiber–matrix interfacial shear failure and local fiber micro-buckling. A user-defined material model has been incorporated into an industrial standard finite element software package to accommodate damage progression. The developed finite element based model(s) have correlated well with the long-term (creep) test results, and can provide a valuable tool in designing reinforced plastics for long-term loading conditions.

N2 - A singly phenoxido-bridged dinuclear Cu∥ complex, [Cu2(L)2(SCN)2(H2O)], has been obtained from a Schiff-base ligand (2-[{[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]imino}methyl]-6-methoxyphenol), generated by condensation of o-vanillin with N,N-dimethylethane-1,2-diamine. The Cu(II) complex has been fully characterised by analytical, spectroscopic, magnetic susceptibility and EPR measurements and DFT calculations, as well as single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. It consists of two geometrically distinct square-pyramidal and octahedral copper(II) centres, exhibiting N2O3 and N4O2 donor sets. In the dimeric unit, the copper atoms are connected by a μ2-phenolato oxygen atom, belonging to one bridging Schiff-base ligand. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate strong antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the Cu(II) centres, with a 2J value of −89(1) cm−1.

N2 - This article functions as the introduction to the Themed Issue on Archaeologies of Fashion Film. The text introduces fashion film as a genre and as an historically dynamic form of audiovisual expression that we approach through fashion history, media archaeology and new film history. While introducing key concepts and approaches, the authors propose a form of ‘parallax historiography’, a term emerging from Thomas Elsaesser’s work, that links different time periods from early cinema to recent digital platforms, even ‘post-cinema’. The introduction makes references to the contributions in this issue that address historical conditions of emergence, marginal voices in the historical record and unexcavated archival materials; and the issue shows how they all contain feedback loops or recursive traits that resonate in contemporary practice where infrastructures of platforms and data frame the moving image.

N2 - This paper explores the use of both macroscale and microscale modelling for the analysis of extrusion of an AA2009 + 25%SiCp metal matrix composite (MMC). The performance of a micromechanical model, where the heterogeneous microstructure of the MMC is explicitly modelled, in predicting the tensile stress—strain behaviour of an AA2009 + 25% SiCp MMC is examined. A macroscale modelling approach is used to simulate extrusion of the MMC through two different die designs, where the MMC is modelled as a homogeneous continuum. Firstly, the extrusion results are used to compare the two die designs, to determine which is the more favourable. Secondly, the predicted macroscale plastic strain distributions and pressures are used with the micromechanical model to assess microscale stress states in the material during extrusion with a view to gaining insights into the risk of damage in the material. In this context, pressure is shown to be hugely important in controlling tensile stress magnitude and in reducing microscale damage risk, and essentially ensuring that extrusion can be achieved in practice. However, the results reveal that damage risk is not totally eliminated and that there may still be locations where the material may rupture.

N2 - Numerical analysis provides an opportunity to solve complex problems using mathematical models. The increasing trend of numerical simulations supports many industries and research organisations to reduce the experimental work. In the present study, considering the positive aspects of numerical analysis, investigations have been done using different failure criteria on the carbon fibre/epoxy composites. Various failure criteria have been discussed that can be used for unidirectional and bidirectional fibre reinforced polymer composites. In this study, the best-suited failure criteria, i.e. Maximum stress, Tsai-Wu and Hashin criteria were combined with the progressive damage analysis to investigate the failure of bidirectional woven carbon fiber/epoxy polymer composites. The experimental validations were also done for numerical predictions. It was found that the Hashin failure criterion gave the results closest to the experimental failure analysis of pin joints. In pin joints prepared from carbon fiber/epoxy composite laminates, Hashin failure criteria predicted the increment in ultimate failure loads in the range of 12–16% for higher values of width to diameter (W/D) and edge to diameter (E/D) ratios. For pin joints prepared from multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) added carbon fiber/epoxy composite laminates, the prediction given by Hashin failure criteria was in the range of 15–19%.

N2 - The purpose of this article is twofold: to theoretically assess ideational and organizational explanatory factors in the adoption of artificial intelligence policies; and to examine the extent to which the European Union has managed to facilitate a coordinated artificial intelligence policy in the Nordic countries. The study utilizes a mixed-methods approach based on systematic web searching, systematic policy document analysis and key informant semi-structured interviews. The study finds that the European Union has utilized framing-based strategies to set an agenda for a coordinated European artificial intelligence policy. Moreover, the strategy has affected member-state artificial intelligence policies to the extent that key tenets of European Union artificial intelligence discourse have penetrated Nordic public documents. However, the extent to which the Nordic countries incorporate European Union artificial intelligence policy discourse diverges at the national level. Differentiated national organizational capacities among Nordic countries make the adoption of artificial intelligence policies divergent. This observation is theoretically accounted for through a conversation between organizational theory of public governance and discursive institutionalism. The study argues that the framing of European Union artificial intelligence policies is filtered through organizational structures among states. Points for practitioners The study illuminates how policymakers in the Nordic countries are affected by the European Union when crafting their own artificial intelligence policies. The European Commission profoundly influences the policymaking of member states and affiliated states through the policy strategy of policy framing. The Commission uses this soft measure to nudge member states to comply with the European Union policy framework. Second, the study shows how ‘organizations matter’: variation in national organizational capacities in the Nordic states contributes to variation in national policy adoption. Even though Nordic countries adopt European Union-level policy frames, their implementation is shaped by varying organizational capacities available at the national level.

N2 - Evaluation of cell response to mechanical stimuli at in vitro conditions is known as one of the important issues for modulating cell behavior. Mechanical stimuli, including mechanical vibration and oscillatory fluid flow, act as important biophysical signals for the mechanical modulation of stem cells. In the present study, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) consists of cytoplasm, nucleus, actin, and microtubule. Also, integrin and primary cilium were considered as mechanoreceptors. In this study, the combined effect of vibration and oscillatory fluid flow on the cell and its components were investigated using numerical modeling. The results of the FEM and FSI model showed that the cell response (stress and strain values) at the frequency of mechanical vibration has the highest value. The achieved results on shear stress caused by the fluid flow on the cell showed that the cell experiences shear stress in the range of . Mechanoreceptors that bind separately to the cell surface, can be highly stimulated by hydrodynamic pressure and, therefore, can play a role in the mechanical modulation of MSCs at in vitro conditions. The results of this research can be effective in future studies to optimize the conditions of mechanical stimuli applied to the cell culture medium and to determine the mechanisms involved in mechanotransduction.

N2 - This paper discusses the implications of the sciences of complexity for public policy and administration. It is argued that the sciences of complexity have implications for our thinking in mainly three areas. First, they revise our conceptions of systems, causal relations, and determinism and depict a picture of mostly indeterministic reality composed of open systems. Second, they offer an “endophysical” and phenomenological view of system - observer relations. Third, although they are heavily quantitative, they illustrate the importance of qualitative interpretations in quantitative analyses and thus bridge the chasm between quantitative and qualitative methodologies. The insights of the sciences of complexity can help us improve our understanding of the complexities of public policy and administrative processes.

N2 - In this study, the corrosion behavior of biodegradable composites is modeled. These composites are made of Poly-Lactic acid and Magnesium with different volume fractions. The scanning electron microscopy images of these composites were taken, and statistical reconstruction of the composite based on scanning electron microscopy images was done by the phase recovery algorithm, the three-dimensional structure of this composite was extracted with this reconstruction, then a three-dimensional cellular automata model was developed to predict the corrosion of this composite. Results of experiments for the composite with 10% of Magnesium volume fraction were used to calibrate the parameters of the cellular automata model, and with these parameters, the results for the composite with 5% of Magnesium volume fraction was obtained, and with comparing these data with the results of the experiment, our model was validated. In the end, we estimated the mechanical properties of these composites and analyzed the results.

N2 - Lime stabilization is a common technique used to improve the engineering properties of clayey soils. The process of lime stabilization can be split into two parts. First, the mobilization and crowding of ions or molecules from hydrated lime at net negative surface charge sites on expansive clay colloids. Second, the formation of pozzolanic products including calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) because of reactions within lime-soil mixtures. The pozzolanic reaction is generally considered to be more durable, while the adsorption has been associated with more easily reversible consistency changes. This study offers a protocol to assess whether the stabilization process is dominated by durable C-S-H (pozzolanic) reactions or a combination of cation exchange and pozzolanic reactions. Expansive clays with plasticity indices >45% from a major highway project in Texas are the focus of lime treatment in this study. The protocol consists of subjecting lime-soil mixtures to a reasonable curing period followed by a rigorous but realistic durability test and investigating the quality and quantity of the pozzolanic reaction product. Mineralogical analyses using quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates the formation of different forms of C-S-H. In addition, geochemical modeling is used to simulate the lime-soil reactions and evaluate the effect of pH on the stability of C-S-H. The results indicate C-S-H with Ca/Si ratio of 0.66 as most the stable form of C-S-H among other forms with Ca/Si ratio ranging from 0.66 to 2.25. The effect of reducing equilibrium pH on C-S-H is also evaluated. A reduction in pH favored dissolution of all forms of C-S-H indicating the need to maintain a pH ≥ 10.

N2 - SARS-CoV-2 has been highly susceptible to mutations since its emergence in Wuhan, China, and its subsequent propagation due to containing an RNA as its genome. The emergence of variants with improved transmissibility still poses a grave threat to global health. The spike protein mutation is mainly responsible for higher transmissibility and risk severity. This study retrieved SARS-CoV-2 variants structural and nonstructural proteins (NSPs) sequences from several geographic locations, including Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North and South America. First, multiple sequence alignments with BioEdit and protein homology modeling were performed using the SWISS Model. Then the structure visualization and structural analysis were performed by superimposing against the Wuhan sequence by Pymol to retrieve the RMSD values. Sequence alignment revealed familiar, uncommon regional among variants and, interestingly, a few unique mutations in Beta, Delta, and Omicron. Structural analysis of such unique mutations revealed that they caused structural deviations in Beta, Delta, and Omicron spike proteins. In addition, these variants were more severe in terms of hospitalization, sickness, and higher mortality, which have a substantial relationship with the structural deviations because of those unique mutations. Such evidence provides insight into the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vulnerability toward mutation and their structural and functional deviations, particularly in Beta, Delta, and Omicron, which might be the cause of their broader coverage. This knowledge can help us with regional vaccine strain selection, virus pathogenicity testing, diagnosis, and treatment with more specific vaccines.

N2 - Interdisciplinarity is becoming increasingly important in education. With the rapidly evolving job market, an interdisciplinary education can prepare students for the flexibility and broad knowledge base required to adapt. At the University of Pisa, we recognized the value of an interdisciplinary educational environment during our participation in the European project EINFOSE, where we harmonized the entry requirements for master programs in Information Science. Prior to this project, we had been building study programs in Digital Humanities and Data Science, whose intersection organically nurtured a diverse learning space. Through this lens, we will reflect on the obstacles constituted by disciplinary barriers and stress the importance of a flexible and open ‘ecosystem’ for education. These conclusions will be supported by data analysis on the careers of our students over the last eight years.

N2 - In the context of recent debates about the ‘data deluge’ and the future of empirical sociology, this article turns attention to current activities aimed at achieving far-reaching transformations to the World Wide Web. The emergent ‘Semantic Web’ has received little attention in sociology, despite its potentially profound consequences for data. In response to more general recent calls for a critical politics of data we focus our enquiry as follows: first, we explore how sociological analysis of the artefacts and tools that are currently being developed to build a Semantic Web helps us to uncover the potential effects of this ‘next generation’ web on knowledge, data and expertise; and second we consider what a Semantic Web might offer to sociological research. We conclude by considering some implications of multidisciplinary engagement with the Web for the future of sociology.

N2 - In this research, a novel nanocomposite bone scaffold made up of Gelatin and Polypyrrole biopolymers and Akermanite and Magnetite bioceramics was fabricated utilizing the freeze-drying method. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis were employed. The existing functional groups and crystalline phases were identified. Microscopic images were taken, and the mean pore cell size was 165.62 µm. According to the results of the liquid displacement method, the porosity was 68% ± 3%. The fabricated scaffolds showed maximum swelling of 1012% during 140 h. The bioactivity was monitored, and the formed Apatite layers were seen in microscopic images. The MTT assay was conducted by Osteoblast cells culture, and after 3 days, 100% cell viability was recorded. 2-D porous multiphase Representative Volume Elements (RVEs) were generated employing the modified Random Sequential Adsorption (mRSA) algorithm. Afterward, we imposed periodic boundary conditions on the boundaries of the RVEs. The homogenized elastic modulus along the X-axis was 14.81 kPa in biaxial compression. In this loading state, homogenized Young’s modulus along the Y-axis was 13.7 kPa. Homogenized Young’s modulus along Y-axis direction under uniaxial loading was 12.54 kPa. According to the micromechanical modeling results, non-isotropic behavior from such scaffolds was seen.

N2 - This study presents an inclusive K-12 AI curriculum for elementary schools, focusing on six design principles to address gender disparities. The curriculum, designed by the researchers and an elementary teacher, uses tangible tools, and emphasizes collaboration in solving daily problems. The MANOVA results revealed initial gender differences in AI knowledge. Following MANCOVA analysis showed significant improvements in AI knowledge, as well as perceptions and behavioral intentions toward AI, effectively bridging the observed knowledge gaps without any significant differences attributed to gender or initial knowledge levels. This evidence underscores the success of tangible and collaborative AI interventions in uniformly enhancing AI knowledge and positively changing perceptions and behavioral intentions among all participants, regardless of gender. Both female and non-binary students felt increased engagement and reduced anxiety toward AI, with improved comprehension and a preference for collaborative learning. This study contributes to the design of inclusive AI interventions, highlighting gender differences and including non-binary students as an essential part of the analysis.

N2 - Presenting oneself visually is an essential part of online behaviors on social networking sites (SNSs), and this is also the case for organizational accounts. Examining organizational self-presentation on their SNS accounts can show the key instruments through which organizations communicate online with the public. Thus, taking startups’ Instagram accounts as examples, this study aims to explore what and how organizations present visually on the photos uploaded to their Instagram accounts. The photos were analyzed in terms of their content, texts in photos, and facial and pixel-level characteristics. Photos and accounts were clustered respectively and resulting clusters were compared as well. The results suggest that text and people are the major objects represented in startups’ Instagram photos. The text presented in the photos was mainly about startups’ efforts to realize social values that can benefit communities by aiding people to do something in a timely manner. Two photo clusters were found: one mainly represented people and people-related words and the other mainly presented texts. Two account clusters were also found: one mainly consists of IT companies that presented texts in their photos and the other mainly consists of human-related services that presented people in their photos. This study can contribute to the body of literature by identifying the visual characteristics of organizational SNS photos and expanding self-presentation research to organizational SNS accounts.

N2 - Understanding differences in the genetic architecture of complex traits between the two sexes has significant implications for evolutionary studies and clinical diagnosis. However, our knowledge about sex-specific genetic architecture is limited largely because of a lack of analytical models that can detect and quantify the effects of sex on the complexity of quantitative genetic variation. Here, we derived a statistical model for mapping DNA sequence variants that contribute to sex-specific differences in allele frequencies, linkage disequilibria, and additive and dominance genetic effects due to haplotype diversity. This model allows a genome-wide search for functional haplotypes and the estimation and test of haplotype by sex interactions and sex-specific heritability. The model, validated by simulation studies, was used to detect sex-specific functional haplotypes that encode a pain sensitivity trait in humans. The model could have important implications for mapping complex trait genes and studying the detailed genetic architecture of sex-specific differences.

N2 - How does media coverage of electoral campaigns distinguish parties and candidates in emerging democracies? To answer, we present a multi-step procedure that we apply in South Africa. First, we develop a theoretically informed classification of election coverage as either “narrow” or “broad” from within the entire corpus of news coverage during an electoral campaign. Second, to deploy our classification scheme, we use a supervised machine learning approach to classify news as “broad,” “narrow,” or “not election-related.” Finally, we combine our supervised classification with a topic modeling algorithm (BERTTopic) that is based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), in addition to other statistical and machine learning methods. The combination of our classification scheme, BERTTopic, and associated methods allows us to identify the main election-related themes among broad and narrow election-related coverage, and how different candidates and parties are associated with these themes. We provide an in-depth discussion of our method for interested users in the social sciences. We then apply our proposed techniques on text from nearly 100,000 news articles during South Africa’s 2014 campaign and test our empirical predictions about candidate and party coverage of corruption, the economy, health, public infrastructure, and security. The application of our method highlights a nuanced campaign environment in South Africa; candidates and parties frequently receive distinct and substantive coverage on key campaign themes.

N2 - Detection of damage in vital and high-cost infrastructures has been one of the major concerns of operators of such structures in the past two decades. The growing demands in oil and gas have forced extraction of such vital fuels in deep waters. Bolted joints are widely used in pipes transporting oil and gas in deep waters. However, they do develop in-service problems, such as loosened bolts, which if remained undetected, could cause significant environmental damage and economical loss, especially in the case of pipes used in deep-water oil extraction. In this study, the energy damage index (EDI) calculated based on a novel vibration-based damage detection methodology using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is used to establish the existence of damage due to loosened bolts in common industrial bolted joints. A complete finite element (FE) model is established to simulate the whole process using the implicit dynamic solver of the commercial software ABAQUS©. Also, a comprehensive experimental program was designed and carried out to verify the FE results. Results show that the EDI based on the EMD method is a powerful tool for not only detecting the damage, but also the progression of the damage in bolted joints.

N2 - Human reasoning and creativity represent perhaps the two highest evolutionary reaches of cognition. These two capacities are distinct from each other, but research on creativity in analogical reasoning has identified a point of convergence between them at one of the farthest forward and most recently evolved reaches of the brain. Analogy is a form of relational cognition because analogies form connections that relate otherwise separate concepts. Quantitative tools for measuring the semantic distance between concepts have advanced the measurement of creativity in relational cognition (more creative relational cognition forms connections across greater semantic distance). These tools are especially useful for the emerging neuroscience of creativity. I describe this semantic-distance approach and how it is being leveraged in my laboratory and elsewhere to investigate not only differences in creative ability between individuals but also creativity as a dynamic state that varies across time within an individual.

N2 - 2,2-Dinitroethene-1,1-diamine (FOX-7) was studied by means of electrospray ionization (ESI) and chemical ionization (CI) mass spectrometry in both positive and negative ion mode. Detailed mechanisms of unimolecular fragmentations of protonated and deprotonated FOX-7 were investigated using high- and low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectrometry, neutral fragment reionization mass spectrometry and quantum chemistry calculations. In deprotonated FOX-7, elimination of the carbodiimide molecule was identified as the energetically most favored fragmentation channel, closely resembling the base hydrolysis of FOX-7. The dinitromethanide ion is formed during this fragmentation as revealed by comparison with CID mass spectra of an isobaric ion prepared by the ESI of authentic sodium dinitromethanide. The proton affinity of FOX-7 was estimated as 855 kJ mol−1 by high-accuracy quantum chemistry calculations. This value corresponds to protonation at the C-2 position, though the oxygen-protonated tautomer was found to be nearly isoenergetic in the gas phase. In acetonitrile, the nitro group-protonated FOX-7 was found to be significantly less stable then its C-2 tautomer. These theoretical findings are clearly reflected in differences in fragmentations of ESI- and CI-generated [M + H]+ ions. Interestingly, the consecutive losses of OH• and NO2• radicals instead of a whole HNO3 molecule were found to account for the most abundant fragment ion in the positive ESI CID mass spectra. In the CI-generated [M + H]+ and [M+D]+ ions, substantial internal energy effects upon the CID were observed.

N2 - To evaluate the dispersion of a heavy gas, such as sulphur hexafluoride, with a low Froude number in a built environment, an experimental and numerical simulation study was conducted. The experiment was carried out using seven different injection inlet configurations in an experimental chamber. The release rate was found to have a great effect on the concentration in the lower part of the chamber. The obstacle in the middle of the chamber could cause a non-uniform distribution of concentration, particularly due to variations in locations and angles of the release outlets. Additionally, numerical simulations were carried out to evaluate four turbulence models: the standard k-ε model, the realizable k-ε model, the re-normalization group (RNG) k-ε model and the shear stress transport (SST) k-ω model. Four indicators were used to evaluate the turbulent model performance. In general, the SST k-ω model performed the best, with geometric mean bias (MG) = 0.968 and geometric variance (VG) = 1.09 at 0.055 m height, and with MG = 0.384 and VG = 2.80 at 0.6 m height. The standard k-ε model was the next best in performance, followed by the realizable k-ε and the RNG k-ε model.

N2 - BACKGROUND: By providing both functional and anatomical information from a single scan, digital imaging technologies like PET/CT and PET/MRI hybrids are gaining popularity in medical imaging industry. In clinical practice, the median value (SUVmed) receives less attention owing to disagreements surrounding what defines a lesion, but the SUVmax value, which is a semi-quantitative statistic used to analyse PET and PET/CT images, is commonly used to evaluate lesions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to build an image processing technique with the purpose of automatically detecting and isolating lesions in PET/CT images, as well as measuring and assessing the SUVmed. METHODS: The pictures are separated into their respective lesions using mathematical morphology and the crescent region, which are both part of the image processing method. In this research, a total of 18 different pictures of lesions were evaluated. RESULTS: The findings of the study reveal that the threshold is satisfied by both the SUVmax and the SUVmed for most of the lesion types. However, in six instances, the SUVmax and SUVmed values are found to be in different courts. CONCLUSION: The new information revealed by this study needs to be further investigated to determine if it has any practical value in diagnosing and monitoring lesions. However, results of this study suggest that SUVmed should receive more attention in the evaluation of lesions in PET and CT images.

N2 - In this article, the authors demonstrate how the data center has become a key site, object, and metaphor for interdisciplinary scholarship of the internet. While the data center is a fabrication of engineering, computer science, and cognate fields, it has been the critical gaze of scholars outside of those industries. Together, this scholarship has established the field of Critical Data Center Studies. Critiques of the data center – often thought of more generally as ‘internet infrastructure’, and more evocatively as ‘the cloud’ – have emerged from the social sciences, humanities, journalism, and the arts. The authors do this by answering questions about the current social, cultural, political, and environmental landscapes of the data center. Scrutiny of the foundational imaginaries of the internet, real estate deals by Big Tech, the industry’s enabling policies, their connections to energy and other public infrastructure – among many other factors – serves, at the very least, to situate the data center as a media object, as more than simply a material infrastructure, as more than data warehouse, and as more than ‘the cloud’. Further to this, the authors reflect on how the data center has been and continues to be studied, and why critical interventions have been so fruitful within a vast array of disciplines – from history and anthropology, to media studies, information studies, and science & technology studies – for shifting the focus from questions of infrastructural visibility to questions that weave together concerns of efficiency, policy, popular culture, and planetary devastation.

N2 - We present a framework for making computation offloading decisions in computational grid settings in which schedulers determine when to move parts of a computation to more capable resources to improve performance. Such schedulers must predict when an offloaded computation will outperform one that is local by forecasting the local cost (execution time for computing locally) and remote cost (execution time for computing remotely and transmission time for the input/output of the computation to/from the remote system). Typically, this decision amounts to predicting the bandwidth between the local and remote systems to estimate these costs. Our framework unifies such decision models by formulating the problem as a statistical decision problem that can either be treated “classically” or using a Bayesian approach. Using an implementation of this framework, we evaluate the efficacy of a number of different decision strategies (several of which have been employed by previous systems). Our results indicate that a Bayesian approach employing automatic change-point detection when estimating the prior distribution is the best performing approach.

N2 - There has been increasing interest in recent years in training in official statistics with reference to the 2030 Agenda, big data, diversification of data types and sources, and data science. Backgrounds for work in official statistics are becoming more varied than ever. The official statistics community has also become progressively more aware of the importance of statistical literacy in education and trust in official statistics. Hence foundation and introductory are of as much interest to official statistics as more specialised training. At the same time, greater access to data and vast technological capabilities have seen much emphasis and discussion of the statistical and data sciences and education therein, including development of educational resources in contexts such as civic data and statistics. Data science provides opportunities to renew the decades-long push for authentic learning that reflects the practice of ‘greater statistics’ and ‘greater data science’, and to examine progress to date in implementing and sustaining the extensive work and advocacy of many. This article discusses what is needed at the foundation and introductory levels to realize this advocacy, with commentary relevant to official statistics.

N2 - Calculating math problems from memory may seem unrelated to everyday processing of emotions, but they have more in common than one might think. Prior research highlights the importance of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in executive control, intentional emotion regulation, and experience of dysfunctional mood and anxiety. Although it has been hypothesized that emotion regulation may be related to “cold” (i.e., not emotion-related) executive control, this assertion has not been tested. We address this gap by providing evidence that greater dlPFC activity during cold executive control is associated with increased use of cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions in everyday life. We then demonstrate that in the presence of increased life stress, increased dlPFC activity is associated with lower mood and anxiety symptoms and clinical diagnoses. Collectively, our results encourage ongoing efforts to understand prefrontal executive control as a possible intervention target for improving emotion regulation in mood and anxiety disorders.

N2 - A detailed micromechanical finite element analysis methodology is presented to predict the transverse tensile (fiber perpendicular) failure behavior of a unidirectional (UD) glass fiber-reinforced plastic composite ply. In order to understand the constituent-level stress–strain and damage behavior, finite element analysis is accomplished using representative volume element (RVE) that consists of random fiber distribution as observed in the microscopic image of an actual composite ply. For modeling the fiber/matrix interface failure behavior, cohesive zone module (cohesive surface/cohesive element) of Abaqus® is used. In order to capture the epoxy matrix stiffness and strength degradation, the following two different approaches are used: (i) initially, the linear Drucker–Prager plasticity model in combination with a ductile fracture criterion is used; (ii) later, a brittle failure approach such as the quadratic normal stress criterion within the framework of eXtended finite element method is used. From the detailed micromechanical analysis of the RVE, it is observed that the initial damage in the RVE occurs in the form of fiber/matrix interface decohesion. With increasing tensile load, interface crack propagates and creates a stress concentration region in the matrix material, adjacent to the crack tip. Further load application causes both interface crack tip and matrix stress concentration to move away from the load application direction. As soon as the interface crack tip reaches approximately 60° to 70° away from the load application direction, the conjunction of the matrix damage with the interface crack leads to the RVE final failure. The predicted average stress–strain curves from the above-mentioned two different epoxy matrix failure criterions (ductile and brittle) correlate very well with the experimental results, indicating that the brittle failure behavior of a UD fiber-reinforced plastic composite ply under transverse tensile load is mainly controlled by the fiber/matrix interface properties.

N2 - Abstract This paper describes the comparison between experimental and computational results for the flow in an inlet system that contains a plenum. Here, the main focus is on the details of the computations and the comparison with experimental results for flow in the plenum. Details of the experiment are described elsewhere. By varying mesh density, boundary conditions, discretization schemes and turbulence models, a wide-ranging study of the accuracy of computational techniques for an industrial problem has been made. In particular, levels of mesh refinement for converged numerical solutions have been determined, together with performance levels for the various settings used. In terms of velocity prediction, when the flow is driven by boundary conditions specified at the outlet more accurate results are achieved. This is due to the flow at the inlet being calculated more accurately in these cases. The effects of different discretization schemes and turbulence models on the velocity predictions are small. Pressure predictions are, however, improved by more complex turbulence models such as the renormalization group (RNG) model.

N2 - Increasing calls for greater STEM-integrated experiences in K–12 education have spawned numerous studies on teacher beliefs, educational goals, and practices for teaching and learning. However, how the field proposes to support the development of teachers’ STEM-integrated disciplinary knowledge appears to be underresearched. In this systematic review, we analyzed 110 articles to determine (a) in what ways has the literature focused on teacher learning, (b) to what extent the literature addressed the development of teachers’ STEM-integrated disciplinary knowledge, and (c) to what extent the literature identified mechanisms for developing teachers’ STEM-integrated disciplinary knowledge. Results reveal needs that include, among others, more studies focused on developing teacher disciplinary knowledge; studies that differentiate teacher needs at different grade levels; studies that differentiate mechanisms aimed at developing teachers’ pedagogical knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and disciplinary knowledge; and studies that explicitly examine the mechanisms being used to support the development of teachers’ STEM-integrated disciplinary knowledge.

N2 - Parabolic trough solar collectors (PTSCs) are commonly used in solar thermal implementations to achieve high-temperatures. The current investigation looks at entropy formation and the effect of nano solid particles on a parabolic trough surface collector (PTSC) mounted aboard a solar-powered ship (SPS). The non-Newtonian first grade viscoelastic type, as well as a porous medium and Darcy-Forchheimer effects, were utilised in the current study. The flowing of PTSC was created by a non-linear stretching sheet, and the changing thermal conductivity, heat source, and viscous dissipation effects were used to calculate the heat flux in the thermal boundary layer. To convert partial differential equations (PDEs) into solvable ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with boundary-constraints, a similarity transformation strategy was used. The boundary-constraints and PDEs have been reduced to a set of non-linear ODEs (ordinary differential equations). To reach the approximated solution of ODEs, the Galerkin finite element method (G-FEM) is used. As working fluids, copper-sodium alginate (Cu-SA) and molybdenum disulfide-copper/sodium alginate (MoS2-Cu/SA) hybrid nanofluids were used. According to the findings, the permeability factor diminished the Nusselt number whilst boosting the skin friction factor. Furthermore, overall entropy variance throughout the domain was increased for flow speeds using the Reynolds number, and viscosity changes were tracked using the Brinkman number. When compared to MoS2-Cu/SA, using Cu-SA nanofluid boosted thermal efficiency by 1.3–18.8%.

N2 - In early phases of design a wide exploration of the design space is crucial to the development of creative solutions. In this regard, Evolutionary Computation (EC), and in particular Genetic Algorithms, contain several qualities that can enhance exploration by opening the search process beyond the focus of finding a single “best” solution. Over the years many researchers in the area of creative thinking including Gordon, de Bono, Parnes, Osborn and others, have suggested design strategies that have interesting parallels in EC processes. For instance, a well known inhibitor of creative thinking is design fixation, where the suggestion of a particular solution makes it difficult to imagine other good solutions. Unlike many other computational search algorithms, EC methods work with populations of “fairly good” solutions. Therefore, there is less danger that creativity will be harmed by design fixation on one “best” solution. This paper shows through a specific example of a truss bridge how an EC based design exploration program can aid the designer by providing a selection of “pretty good” solutions rather than a single optimal solution. Other aspects of the EC program are also discussed including drawbacks to the method such as computational intensity as well as directions of future development.

N2 - Widespread availability of electronic health records coupled with sophisticated statistical methods offer great potential for a variety of applications for health and disease surveillance, developing predictive models and advancing decision support for clinicians. However, use of “big data” mining and discovery techniques has also raised ethical issues such as how to balance privacy and autonomy with the wider public benefits of data sharing. Furthermore, electronic data are being increasingly used to identify individual characteristics, which can be useful for clinical prediction and management, but were not previously disclosed to a clinician. This process in computer parlance is called electronic phenotyping, and has a number of ethical implications. Using the Belmont Report’s principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice as a framework, we examined the ethical issues posed by electronic phenotyping. Ethical issues identified include the ability of the patient to consent for the use of their information, the ability to suppress pediatric information, ensuring that the potential benefits justify the risks of harm to patients, and acknowledging that the clinician’s biases or stereotypes, conscious or unintended, may become a factor in the therapeutic interaction. We illustrate these issues with two vignettes, using the person characteristic of gender minority status (i.e., transgender identity) and health history characteristic of substance abuse. Data mining has the potential to uncover patient characteristics previously obscured, which can provide clinicians with beneficial clinical information. Hence, ethical guidelines must be updated to ensure that electronic phenotyping supports the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.

N2 - There are over 70 low energy and carbon standards in use around the world. None of these standards have been designed by the clients who pay for and occupy the buildings in question. In this work, the client was asked to define the building code for the construction of a new 2800 m2 building via a structured survey. The resulting zero-energy standard simply required the building to incur no energy utility bill. One year of monitoring of the completed building was used to see if the standard had been met. The result of this work is a new way of thinking about environmental building standards that solves many of the issues of obtaining and maintaining buy-in from the client. Practical application: This is the first time that the client has played a key role in the definition of a low-energy building standard. Measured energy consumption and renewable energy generation data are presented and demonstrate that the zero-energy criteria were successfully met. This work is important as it shows that the client can have a meaningful input into the design of an environmental standard. The paper should be of interest to architects, engineers, building energy researchers and those interested in methods that can be used to reduce the energy demand of buildings.

N2 - Calculating math problems from memory may seem unrelated to everyday processing of emotions, but they have more in common than one might think. Prior research highlights the importance of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in executive control, intentional emotion regulation, and experience of dysfunctional mood and anxiety. Although it has been hypothesized that emotion regulation may be related to “cold” (i.e., not emotion-related) executive control, this assertion has not been tested. We address this gap by providing evidence that greater dlPFC activity during cold executive control is associated with increased use of cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions in everyday life. We then demonstrate that in the presence of increased life stress, increased dlPFC activity is associated with lower mood and anxiety symptoms and clinical diagnoses. Collectively, our results encourage ongoing efforts to understand prefrontal executive control as a possible intervention target for improving emotion regulation in mood and anxiety disorders.

N2 - Serious games are a growing field in academic research and they are considered an effective tool for education. Game-based learning invokes motivation and engagement in students resulting in effective instructional outcomes. An essential aspect of a serious game is the method of support for presenting the teaching material and providing feedback. A support design that evaluates students’ progress and adapts accordingly, has the potential of producing better learning results. This paper presents an adaptive model based on fuzzy logic that adjusts the support acquisition according to student knowledge level. A serious game for teaching the concepts of sequence and iteration in programming to novice students was built to assess the model. It employs working examples as a support method since previous research indicated that it produced less cognitive load during problem-solving. An empirical study with 102 students has been conducted to evaluate the learning efficiency of the model. The analysis indicates positive results and a potential solution for balancing the amount of assistance in serious games.

N2 - Becoming proficient in scientific discourse such as argumentation or developing explanations can be challenging for students, including neurodivergent students (e.g., autistic students, students with learning disabilities, students with ADHD). Students need to practice developing arguments and explanations as well as sharing their conclusions with others; however, these opportunities do not regularly occur. The use of multimedia technology shows promise in being an engaging and effective way to support student learning and discussion of science topics and phenomena. This study investigated the use of a multimedia presentation called Dialogic Instruction for Argumentative Learning in Science (DIALS) in supporting upper-elementary neurodivergent students to provide complete responses to science questions. DIALS provides a structured inquiry investigation to the student in which they learn about a phenomenon through completing scaffolded animated experiments, explicitly learning how to develop an argument and respond to others conclusions, and learning relevant content information to support their argument and explanation development. An adapted alternating treatments design approach was used in this study. The phenomena explored were counterbalanced between three options: DIALS, PowerPoint comparison lessons, or control probe slides. Results from this study show promise in the use of DIALS in enhancing student complete responding to questions and providing quality claims for why they think phenomena occur. Implications for the findings are discussed.

N2 - Hashtag campaigns calling out sexual violence and rape myths offer a unique context for disclosing sexual victimization on social media. This study investigates the applicability of adaptive self-reflection as a potential self-effect from such public disclosures of unreported sexual victimization experiences by analyzing 92,583 tweets that invoked #WhyIDidntReport. A supervised machine learning classifier determined that 61.8% of the tweets were self-disclosures of sexual victimization. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) analysis showed statistically significant differences in four psycholinguistic dimensions (greater use of past focus, cognitive processes, insight, and causation words) connected with reflective processing in tweets with self-disclosed sexual victimization compared to those without. Additionally, topic modeling and thematic analysis identified nine salient topics within the self-disclosing tweets, comprising three self-distanced representations (i.e., relatively abstract and insightful construals) of the unwanted experiences: (a) acknowledging one’s previously unacknowledged victimization, (b) reaffirming one’s rationale for not reporting, and (c) decrying invalidating response to one’s disclosure. Moving beyond reception effects and social support in extant research about social media as a coping tool, this study provides new empirical insights into the potential of social media to promote expressive meaning-making of upsetting and traumatic experiences in ways that support recovery and resilience.

N2 - Widespread availability of electronic health records coupled with sophisticated statistical methods offer great potential for a variety of applications for health and disease surveillance, developing predictive models and advancing decision support for clinicians. However, use of “big data” mining and discovery techniques has also raised ethical issues such as how to balance privacy and autonomy with the wider public benefits of data sharing. Furthermore, electronic data are being increasingly used to identify individual characteristics, which can be useful for clinical prediction and management, but were not previously disclosed to a clinician. This process in computer parlance is called electronic phenotyping, and has a number of ethical implications. Using the Belmont Report’s principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice as a framework, we examined the ethical issues posed by electronic phenotyping. Ethical issues identified include the ability of the patient to consent for the use of their information, the ability to suppress pediatric information, ensuring that the potential benefits justify the risks of harm to patients, and acknowledging that the clinician’s biases or stereotypes, conscious or unintended, may become a factor in the therapeutic interaction. We illustrate these issues with two vignettes, using the person characteristic of gender minority status (i.e., transgender identity) and health history characteristic of substance abuse. Data mining has the potential to uncover patient characteristics previously obscured, which can provide clinicians with beneficial clinical information. Hence, ethical guidelines must be updated to ensure that electronic phenotyping supports the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.

N2 - An electrically conducting and magnetically influenced three-dimensional flow of modified nanofluid between two rotating disks is investigated in this study. Nanometer-size particles of two distinct materials (Al2O3, Ag) suspended in water in the hybrid nanofluid are considered. The Joule heating effects, mixed convection, chemical factor, and exponential heating are considered in this study. The physical problem under these assumptions is transformed into a system of equations. To convert partial differential equations (PDEs) into systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the suitable similarity variables are introduced. The reduced system is numerically solved using bvp4c, a well-known higher-order algorithm. The effects of significant variables on the profiles of velocity, temperature, and concentration are depicted graphically. We have chosen the pertinent parameters in the specific intervals; , and . The interactions between a number of significant factors, including skin friction and Nusselt and Sherwood numbers at the higher and lower disks, are shown in tables. The results demonstrate that the local skin fraction decreases as the mixed convection factor is increased, which physically increases the heat transmission rate between the two discs. Furthermore, as the magnetic field and radiation number rise, the rate of heat transfer at the lower and top discs decreases. The numerical results in the form of a table are compared with the available literature, and our results beat the previously published work. The results described here are desirable choices for thermal uses such as automotive cooling systems, solar thermal systems, engineering, medical areas, heat sinks, or current energy storage since they have demonstrated higher thermal characteristics and stability than simple nanofluids (NFs). In Table 6, a comparative numerical study is presented for the various of state variables with the available literature, where the present study is validated.

N2 - Antibiotic resistance has become a serious global concern, and the discovery of antimicrobial herbal constituents may provide valuable solutions to overcome the problem. In this study, the effects of therapies combining antibiotics and four medicinal herbs on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were investigated. Specifically, the synergistic effects of Magnolia officinalis, Verbena officinalis, Momordica charantia, and Daphne genkwa in combination with oxacillin or gentamicin against methicillin-resistant (ATCC43300) and methicillin-susceptible (ATCC25923) S. aureus were examined. In vitro susceptibility and synergistic testing were performed to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index of the antibiotics and medicinal herbs against MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. To identify the active constituents in producing these synergistic effects, in silico molecular docking was used to investigate the binding affinities of 139 constituents of the four herbs to the two common MRSA inhibitory targets, penicillin binding proteins 2a (PBP2a) and 4 (PBP4). The physicochemical and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties and drug safety profiles of these compounds were also analyzed. D. genkwa extract potentiated the antibacterial effects of oxacillin against MRSA, as indicated by an FIC index value of 0.375. M. officinalis and V. officinalis produced partial synergistic effects when combined with oxacillin, whereas M. charantia was found to have no beneficial effects in inhibiting MRSA. Overall, tiliroside, pinoresinol, magnatriol B, and momorcharaside B were predicted to be PBP2a or PBP4 inhibitors with good drug-like properties. This study identifies compounds that deserve further investigation with the aim of developing therapeutic agents to modulate the effect of antibiotics on MRSA. Impact statement Antibiotic resistant is a well-known threat to global health and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most significant ones. These resistant bacteria kill thousands of people every year and therefore a new effective antimicrobial treatment is necessary. This study identified the herbs and their associated bioactive ingredients that can potential the effects of current antibiotics. These herbs have long history of human usage in China and have well-defined monograph in the Chinese Pharmacopeia. These indicate their relatively high clinical safety and may have a quicker drug development process than that of a new novel antibiotic. Based on the results of this study, the authors will perform further in vitro and animal studies, aiming to accumulate significant data for the application of clinical trial.

N2 - The selection of internal fixation as the primary fixation modality for the patient is one of the challenges for the surgeon treating the patient in question. A model of the lateral tibial plateau fracture was established. Three different configurations of internal fixators namely L bone plate, T bone plate, and screw-washer were analyzed. Three stages after surgery were simulated to assess the displacement of bone plates, screws, washers, and the stress shielding ratio in the fracture area. At three stages after surgery, the T bone plate showed better stability for patients during rehabilitation compared with the remaining two schemes, and the screw-washer scheme was the least stable due to the larger internal fixation displacement and stress shielding ratio in the fracture area. In contrast, the L bone plate scheme showed better stability in the early stages after surgery but was second only to the screw-washer scheme in the middle and late stages after surgery. The T bone plate showed better stability and became a new selection for surgeons to treat related patients. At three stages after surgery, the T bone plate has better biomechanical stability compared to the L bone plate and screw-washer schemes.

N2 - In 5 months of COVID isolation, living out of a suitcase in temporary housing, countless fractal patterns emerged. I can’t say if I created these patterns by looking for them, or that I know the whole world by looking at a grain of sand. The truth of the matter is that it feels like the key for massive scale change is just in front of us, but slipping from our grasp. As we move through these days, weeks, and months, we have very little time before the difference recedes again. I address this matter of concern as a matter of method in performative grounded theory piece.

N2 - Current reform efforts in science place a premium on student sense making and participation in the practices of science. Given the disparity between these activities and current teaching practices, effective means of professional development around such practices must be identified. We use a close examination of 106 science teachers participating in Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) to identify, through structural equation modeling, the essential features in supporting teacher learning from these experiences. Findings suggest that participation in RET shape science teacher practice and beliefs, which in turn influence practice. Essential features of RET include engaging teachers socially in the research context and in research projects that are personally relevant to them. The model suggests ways to maximize the professional development potential of RET intended to support engagement in disciplinary practices.

N2 - Serious games are a growing field in academic research and they are considered an effective tool for education. Game-based learning invokes motivation and engagement in students resulting in effective instructional outcomes. An essential aspect of a serious game is the method of support for presenting the teaching material and providing feedback. A support design that evaluates students’ progress and adapts accordingly, has the potential of producing better learning results. This paper presents an adaptive model based on fuzzy logic that adjusts the support acquisition according to student knowledge level. A serious game for teaching the concepts of sequence and iteration in programming to novice students was built to assess the model. It employs working examples as a support method since previous research indicated that it produced less cognitive load during problem-solving. An empirical study with 102 students has been conducted to evaluate the learning efficiency of the model. The analysis indicates positive results and a potential solution for balancing the amount of assistance in serious games.

N2 - Recent years have seen a significant increase in the importance of environmental protection and sustainability to consumers, policy makers, and society in general. Reflecting this, most organizations are at least aware of this new agenda and wish to be seen as taking steps to improve behaviors in this regard. However, there appears to be a gap between this evolving agenda and the comparatively low level of knowledge that marketing managers actually have of the environmental impact of their own functional decisions. We suggest that this low knowledge level may be due, in part, to the marketplace focus of foundational marketing educational programs, and we attempt to show how broadening the horizons of marketing courses can help students (i.e., future managers) more deeply understand the environmental consequences of their actions. We demonstrate the use of a novel business game, based on the Life Cycle Assessment method, as the foundational cornerstone for the development of a broad understanding of the environmental impact of marketing decisions and actions for the entire life cycle of a product—from raw material extraction to ultimate disposal. The results of an empirical study show that this approach increases students’ appreciation for, and understanding of, these fundamental environmental sustainability concepts.

N2 - Multiple recent works have emphasized the contribution that nondigital game scholarship can make to the study of games and gameplay. Warhammer 40,000 is the market dominator of the nondigital tabletop wargame genre. In this article, we perform a ludological analysis of the process of preparing, or drafting, an army for a competitive Warhammer 40,000 tournament. We find that there are four interrelated categories of resources that influence this fundamentally playful process. Our results indicate that this process of preparation constitutes a core component of the appeal of Warhammer 40,000. This emphasizes the importance of understanding the diverse activities that go into gameplay that often exceed the computer game “client” or board of play. We suggest the category of engagement pastime to encapsulate these extended, ongoing elements of Warhammer 40,000’s appeal, which we define as a collection of interlinked and associated activities that serve to occupy one’s time and thoughts pleasantly.

N2 - Current research and theory indicate that college students’ scientific and statistical reasoning skills are deficient, but can be improved through instruction. Accordingly, an innovative statistics course was developed for the undergraduate education curriculum at the University of Wisconsin—Madison. The course promoted the idea “that the purpose of statistics is to organize a useful argument from quantitative evidence based on a form of principled rhetoric” (Abelson, 1995, pp. xiii). Most instruction was anchored to mentored, small-group collaborative activities that simulated complex, real-life problem solving. In conjunction with the second offering, evidence of student growth was obtained from pre- and post-course interviews designed to assess students’ ability to reason with statistical evidence from everyday sources. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses indicated that students made meaningful gains in their ability to reason statistically. Analyses also pointed to specific conceptual confusions, some related to course design. Students’ reactions Io the course were variable.

N2 - Recent calls encourage teacher education programs to examine how they address equity within educational technology coursework. This study therefore conceptualizes equity specifically related to using digital tools with multilingual learners. Drawing on a technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework informed by prior research on (language) teacher education and computer-assisted language learning, this study examines how preservice teachers described their knowledge base specifically related to using digital tools equitably with multilingual learners. Qualitative analysis of 17 preservice teachers’ course discussions, assignments, and interviews revealed that preservice teachers purposefully reflected on and selected digital tools to use that would support students’ language development and leverage students’ interests. They also reflected on structural inequities and advocacy related to technological implementation. This study encourages teacher educators to support preservice teachers in developing technologically savvy practices that are also linguistically responsive and humanizing by centering equity in TPACK.

N2 - Neurophysiological signals are crucial intermediaries, through which brain activity can be quantitatively measured and brain mechanisms are able to be revealed. In particular, non‐invasive neurophysiological signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are welcomed and frequently utilised in various studies since these signals can be non‐invasively recorded without harming the human brain while they convey abundant information pertaining to brain activity. The recorded neurophysiological signals are analysed to mine meaningful information for the understanding of brain mechanisms or are classified to distinguish different patterns (e.g., different cognitive states, brain diseases versus healthy controls). To date, remarkable progress has been made in both the analysis and classification of neurophysiological signals, but scholars are not feeling complacent. Consistent effort ought to be paid to advance the research of analysis and classification based on neurophysiological signals. In this paper, I express my thoughts regarding promising future directions in neurophysiological signal analysis and classification based on current developments and accomplishments. I will elucidate the thoughts after brief summaries of relevant backgrounds, accomplishments, and tendencies. According to my personal selection and preference, I mainly focus on brain connectivity, multidimensional array (tensor), multi‐modality, multiple task classification, deep learning, big data, and naturalistic experiment. Hopefully, my thoughts could give a little help to inspire new ideas and contribute to the research of the analysis and classification of neurophysiological signals in some way.

N2 - Purpose: We aim to better understand the curricular, staffing, and achievement trade-offs entailed by expansions of high-school computer science (CS) for students, schools, and school leaders. Methods: We use descriptive, correlational, and quasi-experimental methods to analyze statewide longitudinal course-, school-, and staff-level data from California, where CS course taking has expanded rapidly. Findings: We find that these rapid CS course expansions have not come at the expense of CS teachers’ observable qualifications (namely certification, education, or experience). Within-school course taking patterns over time suggest that CS enrollment growth has come at the expense of social studies, English/language arts (ELA), and arts courses, as well as from other miscellaneous electives. However, we find no evidence that increased enrollment of students in CS courses at a school has a significant effect on students’ math or ELA test scores. Implications: Flexible authorization requirements for CS teachers appear to have allowed school leaders to staff new CS courses with teachers whose observable qualifications are strong, though we do not observe teachers’ CS teaching skill. Increasing CS participation is unlikely to noticeably improve school-level student test scores, but administrators also do not need to be overly concerned that test scores will suffer. However, school leaders and policymakers should think carefully about what courses new CS courses will replace and whether such replacements are worthwhile.

N2 - In recent years, higher education institutions have been under increasing pressure to innovate in teaching, research, and learning methodologies. This longitudinal study adopts a participatory research approach, utilizing photovoice techniques, narrative methodologies, and focus groups to explore student perceptions of innovative pedagogies within a specialized Higher Education Institution (HEI). Spanning three academic semesters and involving 43 students from a variety of disciplines, the research integrates photographs and self-authored narratives as data sources. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), in conjunction with photovoice, facilitated a detailed data analysis, revealing four main clusters of pedagogies viewed as innovative by students: “Hero Pedagogies,” highlighting emotional engagement and storytelling; “Community and Solidarity Pedagogies,” emphasizing community involvement; “Sustainable Green Pedagogies,” focusing on sustainability; and “Technology Enhanced Pedagogies,” which utilize technology to improve learning experiences. Students expressed a strong preference for pedagogical strategies that promote emotional connections and incorporate storytelling, stressing the importance of human interaction in the learning process. They also valued approaches that foster community-centered learning, interdisciplinary methods, and experiential education for tackling broader societal and economic challenges. The role of technology in bridging theory with practical application was also underscored. These findings offer insights into effective pedagogical practices by highlighting student-supported approaches. Integrating these innovative pedagogical clusters can enhance the educational experience for institutions, communities, and learners alike, fostering active engagement in the learning journey.

N2 - A multicriteria decision-making model was proposed in order to acquire the optimum one among different product design schemes. VIKOR method was introduced to compute the ranking value of each scheme. A multiobjective optimization model for criteria weight was established. In this model, projection pursuit method was employed to identify a criteria weight set which could keep classification information of original schemes to the greatest extent, while PROMETHEE II was adopted to keep sorting information. Dominance based multiobjective simulated annealing algorithm (D-MOSA) was introduced to solve the optimization model. Finally, an example was taken to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of this model.

N2 - Interest in new empiricisms and transdisciplinary methods has led many social inquirers to engage with 20th-century post-classical physical science. Many of these projects have focused on alternative matter–mind mixtures and in/organic variation, concerned that past theories of sociality have dismissed the vibrancy and animacy of the nonhuman material world. This paper explores the power of speculative fiction to help us rethink empiricism in posthuman ecologies of the Anthropocene, in the midst of post-truth conditions and growing science denialism. We foreground speculative fiction as a way to open up scientific imaginaries, rethinking the relationship between nature, technics, and human “sense” making. We show how such texts offer alternative images of research methods for studying pluralist ecologies and new forms of worldly belonging.

N2 - Abstract In this paper a three-dimensional computational methodology for multistage turbomachinery flows is developed, validated and applied in analysing the reduced mass flowrate operation of a four-stage turbine. The flow is modelled by the three-dimensional Favre-Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations using the Launder-Sharma near-wall k-ɛ turbulence closure, which are integrated using an implicit third-order upwind solver. The computation models the eight blade rows, including the tip clearance gaps of the rotors, using a 6 × 106 points grid, and computes the time-averaged flow using mixing planes between rows. Computational results are compared with measurements for various operating points. After this validation the method is used in a first attempt to analyse the three-dimensional flow at reduced-mass-flow operation.

N2 - Based on Unconscious Thought Theory (UTT) and a series of experimental and correlational studies, Dijksterhuis and his colleagues conclude that when making complex choices/decisions, conscious thought—deliberation while attention is directed at the problem—leads to poorer choices/decisions than “unconscious thought”—deliberation in the absence of conscious attention directed at the problem. UTT comprises six principles said to apply to decision making, impression formation, attitude formation and change, problem solving, and creativity. Because the implications of UTT for psychological research and theory are considerable, the authors critically examined these six principles (and the studies used to support them) in light of the extant scholarship on unconscious processes, memory, attention, and social cognition. Our examination reveals that UTT is a theory of the unconscious that fails to take into account important work in cognitive psychology, particularly in the judgment and decision making area. Moreover, established literatures in social psychology that contradict fundamental tenets of UTT and its empirical basis are ignored. The authors conclude that theoretical and experimental deficiencies undermine the claims of the superiority of unconscious thinking as portrayed by UTT.

N2 - This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of using educational games for learning basic programing skills. For this, we designed the game “Aladdin and his flying carpet” with all pedagogical consideration in mind. We conducted the experiment with 107 sixth grade pupils with no prior knowledge of programing. The game was applied at the beginning of the course in a naturalistic classroom environment. The progress was monitored and evaluated with validated pre- and posttests. The knowledge gain was observed according to the set of learning objectives from the general curricula, and minimum knowledge standards were pursued within those. The result demonstrated that most of the pupils achieved all of the observed learning objectives. The biggest progress was observed with the “complete a program” objective. The least progress was observed with the tasks where “create a program” and “divide a problem” objectives were combined. Strong correlation was found between the final results of the posttest and the scores from playing the game, especially with the more challenging “divide a problem” learning objective. Finally, no significant difference was observed in the results between girls and boys.

N2 - Students with learning disabilities (LD) often receive instruction in general education science classrooms. However, little is known about the academic success of students with LD in this setting. As inquiry-based science instruction has become more prominent, research focusing on student learning is needed to explore how such instruction meets students’ needs. To address this, a cross-case analysis was conducted. It included six middle school students, each with LD, from a Midwestern city. Each student was enrolled in a general education science class that used inquiry-based instruction. Data sources included student and educator interviews, classroom observations, and student portfolios. Results indicated that most of the students with LD had difficulty acquiring science process knowledge and that students relied on peer supports to facilitate their learning. Findings extend the research on science instruction for students with LD in middle school classrooms using inquiry-based instruction.

N2 - In this article, we present a study focused on developing students’ understanding the ecology through participation in a technology-supported urban planning simulation—specifically, 11 high school students in Madison, Wisconsin acted as urban planners to redesign a local shopping street using a Geographic Information System (GIS) model. This experimental design was situated within the theory of pedagogical praxis, which suggests that modeling learning environments on authentic professional practices enables youth to develop a deeper understanding of important domains of inquiry (Shaffer, 2004). Results presented here suggest that through participation in the project students: a) developed an understanding of ecology; and b) developed this understanding through the urban planning practices and the features of the GIS model used during the project. Thus, we propose that this augmented by reality learning environment modeled on the professional practices of urban planners extends the theory of pedagogical praxis into the domain of ecology and offers a useful method for developing ecological understanding through participation in simulations that incorporate the authentic tools and practices of urban planning.

N2 - This article introduces the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to a criminological audience. After a general review of the phenomenon (including brief explanations of important cognate fields such as ‘machine learning’, ‘deep learning’, and ‘reinforcement learning’), the paper then turns to the potential application of AI by criminals, including what we term here ‘crimes with AI’, ‘crimes against AI’, and ‘crimes by AI’. In these sections, our aim is to highlight AI’s potential as a criminogenic phenomenon, both in terms of scaling up existing crimes and facilitating new digital transgressions. In the third part of the article, we turn our attention to the main ways the AI paradigm is transforming policing, surveillance, and criminal justice practices via diffuse monitoring modalities based on prediction and prevention. Throughout the paper, we deploy an array of programmatic examples which, collectively, we hope will serve as a useful AI primer for criminologists interested in the ‘tech-crime nexus’.

N2 - This article reports on a year-long study of high school students learning computer programming. The study examined three issues: 1) what is the impact of programming on particular mathematical and reasoning abilities?; 2) what cognitive skills or abilities best predict programming ability?; and 3) what do students actually understand about programming after two years of high school study? The results showed that even after two years of study, many students had only a rudimentary understanding of programming. Consequently, it was not surprising to also find that programming experience (as opposed to expertise) does not appear to transfer to other domains which share analogous formal properties. The article concludes that we need to more closely study the pedagogy of programming and how expertise can be better attained before we prematurely go looking for significant and wide reaching transfer effects from programming.

N2 - Information technology and computer science represent one area of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) that have experienced significant growth in recent years. As such, federal policy has urged schools to embed new types of STEM courses into the curriculum. As one very prominent example, computer science (CS)-focused courses are a growing branch of career and technical education (CTE)—that is, CS-CTE. While previous research has examined coursetaking patterns and subsequent outcomes of CS-CTE courses for the general student population, little is known about how participation in these courses may benefit students with learning disabilities (SWLDs). From a pedagogical perspective, CS-CTE courses, and CTE courses in general, may be uniquely positioned to improve schooling outcomes for SWLDs. Using data from the nationally representative High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, we explored characteristics of CS-CTE participants, how CS-CTE may promote the development of key STEM attitudes (e.g., identity, self-efficacy, and utility), and how any relationships may differ by learning disability status. Using a double propensity score matching estimations, we found CS-CTE participation related to positive development of STEM identity and STEM self-efficacy for students without learning disabilities. For the SWLD population, CS-CTE participation was associated with growth in STEM self-efficacy and STEM utility. Policy implications discuss the gap in computer science employment between SWLDs and non-SWLDs, the prevalence of state-related computer science policies, and how to continue to promote STEM identity growth.

N2 - Science and technology studies (STS) and the emerging field of data science share surprising elective affinities. At the growing intersections of these fields, there will be many opportunities and not a few thorny difficulties for STS scholars. First, I discuss how both fields frame the rollout of data science as a simultaneously social and technical endeavor, even if in distinct ways and for diverging purposes. Second, I discuss the logic of domains in contemporary computer, information, and data science circles. While STS is often agnostic about the borders between the sciences or with industry and state—occasionally taking those boundaries as an object of study—data science takes those boundaries as its target to overcome. These two elective affinities present analytic and practical challenges for STS but also opportunities for engagement. Overall, in addition to these typifications, I urge STS scholars to strategically position themselves to investigate and contribute to the breadth of transformations that seek to touch virtually every science and newly bind spheres of academy, industry, and state.

N2 - This article investigates the motivations of African American and Latino girls (N = 41) who navigate urban Southwest school districts during the day, but voluntarily attend a 2-year, culturally responsive multimedia program after school and into the summer. Understanding that girls from economically disadvantaged settings are indeed motivated to become technological innovators but often do not have access to the necessary resources to follow their interest, our program—entitled COMPUGIRLS—assumes a culturally responsive computing approach. This research examines particular features of the program (e.g., asset building, reflections, and connectedness) that attracted and retained the Latina (74%) and African American (19%) adolescent (ages 13-18) participants as well as to what extent the culturally relevant aspects of the curriculum assist with program retention and/or affect the students’ vision of themselves as a future technologist. An evaluative approach gathered 2 years of data from the participants. Field notes from observations and interviews were transcribed and reviewed to extract themes and areas of convergence. As a standpoint theory project, the authors center the girls’ voices as the primary data sources. Two primary themes emerged from the data to explain girls’ sustained motivation. The first was the challenge of learning and mastering the technology. For many, this also included disproving the stereotypes of their abilities by age, gender, and race. The second theme was being able to manipulate technology and learning experiences as a means of self-expression and research, particularly if the results could be used to inform their community and peers. The authors posit that much of the program impact was because of the culturally responsive practices (asset building, reflection, and connectedness) embedded within the curriculum. Implications for urban educators and program developers are considered.

N2 - The business model of architecture has been accused of being technologically deficient. Through case studies, this paper investigates alternatives to the status quo of computation in architecture, with a focus on design-oriented service providers. It first examines the discourse on computation within the field, then describes the experiments of a relevant design firm before discussing implications for the wider industry. In the process, the paper articulates the gap between theoretical computing applications and the realities of the architecture business. It addresses difficult technological adaptations within the industry with concrete use cases of integrated computing expertise, highlighting opportunities, benefits, and, more importantly, the need for a computational workforce.

N2 - Computational thinking is an approach to problem solving that is typically employed by computer programmers. The advantage of this approach is that solutions can be generated through algorithms that can be implemented as computer code. Although computational thinking has historically been a skill that is exclusively taught within computer science, there has been a more recent movement to introduce these skills within other disciplines. Psychology is an excellent example of a discipline that would benefit from computational thinking skills because of the nature of questions that are typically asked within the discipline. However, there has not been a formal curriculum proposed to teach computational thinking within psychology and the behavioural sciences. I will argue that computational thinking is a fundamental skill that can easily be introduced to psychology students throughout their undergraduate education. This would provide students with the skills necessary to become successful researchers, and would also provide a practical and marketable skill to all psychology graduates.

N2 - Increased technological advances within marine biology requires professionals to become versed in interdisciplinary computer-based skills. Computational thinking (CT) is a contemporary concept used in educational settings across the globe to meet this need. CT has been incorporated into many curricula; however, incorporation strategies are vague and result in specific challenges for post-secondary marine science educators. We developed a framework to support an intervention which incorporated CT into learning marine biology quantitative skills for students in an introductory marine science course at a small liberal arts university in the northeastern United States through a quasi-experimental action research design. We assessed student participant content knowledge through two assessments, student artifacts and a self-perception survey. Results indicate that the intervention was successful in overall participant knowledge gains in both quantitative marine biology skills and computational thinking. Our research design may shed light on how post-secondary institutions may address student range of computational thinking skills within marine science to better support sustainability practices and promote equity and present its applicability to other settings.

N2 - This article provides an overview of the diverse ways in which computational thinking has been operationalised in the literature. Computational thinking has attracted much interest and debatably ranks in importance with the time-honoured literacy skills of reading, writing, and arithmetic. However, learning interventions in this subject have modelled computational thinking differently. We conducted a systematic review of 81 empirical studies to examine the nature, explicitness, and patterns of definitions of computational thinking. Data analysis revealed that most of the reviewed studies operationalised computational thinking as a composite of programming concepts and preferred definitions from assessment-based frameworks. On the other hand, a substantial number of the studies did not establish the meaning of computational thinking when theorising their interventions nor clearly distinguish between computational thinking and programming. Based on these findings, this article proposes a model of computational thinking that focuses on algorithmic solutions supported by programming concepts which advances the conceptual clarity between computational thinking and programming.

N2 - Computational thinking (CT) is being recognized as a critical component of student success in the digital era. Many contend that integrating CT into core curricula is the surest method for providing all students with access to CT. However, the CT community lacks an agreed-upon conceptualization of CT that would facilitate this integration, and little effort has been made to critically analyze and synthesize research on CT/content integration (CTCI). Conflicting CT conceptualizations and little understanding of evidence-based strategies for CTCI could result in significant barriers to increasing students’ access to CT. To address these concerns, we analyzed 80 studies on CT education, focusing on both the CT conceptualizations guiding current CT education research and evidence-based strategies for CTCI. Our review highlights the code-centric nature of CT education and reveals significant gaps in our understanding of CTCI and CT professional development for teachers. Based on these findings, we propose an approach to operationalizing CT that promotes students’ participation in CT, present promising methods for infusing content with CT, and discuss future directions for CT education research.

N2 - Computational thinking (CT) is an emerging and multifaceted competence important to the computing era. However, despite the growing consensus that CT is a competence domain, its theoretical and empirical account remain scarce in the current literature. To address this issue, rigorous psychometric evaluation procedures were adopted to investigate the structure of CT competency, as measured by Computational Thinking Challenge (Lai, 2021a), in a large sample of 1,130 British secondary school students (Mage = 14.14 years, SDage = 1.45). Based on model comparison from an exploratory multidimensional item response theory approach, the results supported the multidimensional operationalization of CT competency. A confirmatory bi-factor item response theory model further suggested CT competency is comprised of a general CT competency factor and two specific factors for programming and non-programming problem-solving. Despite the multidimensionality, the common variance is largely explained by a primary general factor of CT competency, thus the use of a single scale score is recommended. Psychometric evaluation from the bi-factor model indicated good psychometric properties of the assessment tool. Overall, the bi-factor model provides a useful approach to investigating CT competency and serves as a robust test validation tool.

N2 - This study was grounded in the spatial computational thinking model developed by the 3D Weather project funded by the NSF STEM+C program. The model reflects a discipline-based perspective towards computational thinking and captures the spatial nature of computational thinking in meteorology and the reliance of computational thinking on spatial thinking for geospatial analysis. The research was conducted among nineteen teachers attending the summer workshop offered by the project in its third project year to prepare them for teaching spatial computational thinking with IDV (Integrated Data Viewer, downloadable at https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/idv/) visualization of weather data. Quantitative survey data were collected measuring these teachers’ meteorology content knowledge, spatial computational thinking, self-efficacy for teaching spatial computational thinking, and epistemic cognition of teaching meteorology. The data were analyzed to examine the effects of the workshop in terms of these variables and the correlations among them were also explored.

N2 - Computational thinking has received tremendous attention from computer science educators and educational researchers in the last decade. However, most prior literature defines computational thinking as thinking outcomes rather than thinking processes. Based on Selby and Woodland’s framework, this study developed and validated the Computational Thinking Scale (CTS) to assess all students’ thought processes of computational thinking for both general and specific problem-solving contexts in five dimensions: abstraction, decomposition, algorithmic thinking, evaluation and generalization. A survey including 25 candidate items for CTS as well as demographic variables was administered to 388 junior high school students in Taiwan. An explorative factor analysis using the principal axis method with the oblimin rotation was used to validate the scale. Finally, 19 items were extracted successfully under the designed five dimensions, with a total explained variance of 64.03% and an overall reliability of 0.91. Results of the demographic comparisons showed that boys had a greater disposition than girls in decomposition thinking when solving problems using computer programming. In addition, programming learning experience, especially self-directed learning and after-school learning, had significant positive effects on all dimensions of CTS. Several future studies are suggested using this tool.

N2 - A prior study developed the Computational Thinking Scale (CTS) for assessing individuals’ computational thinking dispositions in five dimensions: decomposition, abstraction, algorithmic thinking, evaluation, and generalization. This study proposed the Developmental Model of Computational Thinking through validating the structural relationships among the five factors of the CTS. To examine the model, a questionnaire including the CTS was administered to 472 middle school students. A confirmatory factor analysis was used to confirm the construct of the measurements, and a PLS-SEM analysis was used to validate the structural relationships among the factors. The results confirmed that the 19-item CTS has good item reliability, internal consistency, and construct reliability for measuring computational thinking (CT). In the Developmental Model of CT, decomposition and abstraction significantly predict all other three CT dispositions, suggesting that they are the two fundamental factors required for CT development. Moreover, a significant linear prediction path was shown starting from algorithmic thinking, evaluation, until generalization. Thus, a multi-level model was confirmed for the conceptual framework of CT. This model suggests a possible sequence for CT development which may provide a guideline for the teaching objectives of CT for different learning stages in different school levels. Decomposition and abstraction are especially suggested to be emphasized in school curricula before teaching algorithmic thinking or algorithm designs.
