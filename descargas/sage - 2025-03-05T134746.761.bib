N2 - BACKGROUND: By providing both functional and anatomical information from a single scan, digital imaging technologies like PET/CT and PET/MRI hybrids are gaining popularity in medical imaging industry. In clinical practice, the median value (SUVmed) receives less attention owing to disagreements surrounding what defines a lesion, but the SUVmax value, which is a semi-quantitative statistic used to analyse PET and PET/CT images, is commonly used to evaluate lesions. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to build an image processing technique with the purpose of automatically detecting and isolating lesions in PET/CT images, as well as measuring and assessing the SUVmed. METHODS: The pictures are separated into their respective lesions using mathematical morphology and the crescent region, which are both part of the image processing method. In this research, a total of 18 different pictures of lesions were evaluated. RESULTS: The findings of the study reveal that the threshold is satisfied by both the SUVmax and the SUVmed for most of the lesion types. However, in six instances, the SUVmax and SUVmed values are found to be in different courts. CONCLUSION: The new information revealed by this study needs to be further investigated to determine if it has any practical value in diagnosing and monitoring lesions. However, results of this study suggest that SUVmed should receive more attention in the evaluation of lesions in PET and CT images.

N2 - In this article, the authors demonstrate how the data center has become a key site, object, and metaphor for interdisciplinary scholarship of the internet. While the data center is a fabrication of engineering, computer science, and cognate fields, it has been the critical gaze of scholars outside of those industries. Together, this scholarship has established the field of Critical Data Center Studies. Critiques of the data center – often thought of more generally as ‘internet infrastructure’, and more evocatively as ‘the cloud’ – have emerged from the social sciences, humanities, journalism, and the arts. The authors do this by answering questions about the current social, cultural, political, and environmental landscapes of the data center. Scrutiny of the foundational imaginaries of the internet, real estate deals by Big Tech, the industry’s enabling policies, their connections to energy and other public infrastructure – among many other factors – serves, at the very least, to situate the data center as a media object, as more than simply a material infrastructure, as more than data warehouse, and as more than ‘the cloud’. Further to this, the authors reflect on how the data center has been and continues to be studied, and why critical interventions have been so fruitful within a vast array of disciplines – from history and anthropology, to media studies, information studies, and science & technology studies – for shifting the focus from questions of infrastructural visibility to questions that weave together concerns of efficiency, policy, popular culture, and planetary devastation.

N2 - We present a framework for making computation offloading decisions in computational grid settings in which schedulers determine when to move parts of a computation to more capable resources to improve performance. Such schedulers must predict when an offloaded computation will outperform one that is local by forecasting the local cost (execution time for computing locally) and remote cost (execution time for computing remotely and transmission time for the input/output of the computation to/from the remote system). Typically, this decision amounts to predicting the bandwidth between the local and remote systems to estimate these costs. Our framework unifies such decision models by formulating the problem as a statistical decision problem that can either be treated “classically” or using a Bayesian approach. Using an implementation of this framework, we evaluate the efficacy of a number of different decision strategies (several of which have been employed by previous systems). Our results indicate that a Bayesian approach employing automatic change-point detection when estimating the prior distribution is the best performing approach.

N2 - There has been increasing interest in recent years in training in official statistics with reference to the 2030 Agenda, big data, diversification of data types and sources, and data science. Backgrounds for work in official statistics are becoming more varied than ever. The official statistics community has also become progressively more aware of the importance of statistical literacy in education and trust in official statistics. Hence foundation and introductory are of as much interest to official statistics as more specialised training. At the same time, greater access to data and vast technological capabilities have seen much emphasis and discussion of the statistical and data sciences and education therein, including development of educational resources in contexts such as civic data and statistics. Data science provides opportunities to renew the decades-long push for authentic learning that reflects the practice of ‘greater statistics’ and ‘greater data science’, and to examine progress to date in implementing and sustaining the extensive work and advocacy of many. This article discusses what is needed at the foundation and introductory levels to realize this advocacy, with commentary relevant to official statistics.

N2 - Calculating math problems from memory may seem unrelated to everyday processing of emotions, but they have more in common than one might think. Prior research highlights the importance of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in executive control, intentional emotion regulation, and experience of dysfunctional mood and anxiety. Although it has been hypothesized that emotion regulation may be related to “cold” (i.e., not emotion-related) executive control, this assertion has not been tested. We address this gap by providing evidence that greater dlPFC activity during cold executive control is associated with increased use of cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions in everyday life. We then demonstrate that in the presence of increased life stress, increased dlPFC activity is associated with lower mood and anxiety symptoms and clinical diagnoses. Collectively, our results encourage ongoing efforts to understand prefrontal executive control as a possible intervention target for improving emotion regulation in mood and anxiety disorders.

N2 - A detailed micromechanical finite element analysis methodology is presented to predict the transverse tensile (fiber perpendicular) failure behavior of a unidirectional (UD) glass fiber-reinforced plastic composite ply. In order to understand the constituent-level stress–strain and damage behavior, finite element analysis is accomplished using representative volume element (RVE) that consists of random fiber distribution as observed in the microscopic image of an actual composite ply. For modeling the fiber/matrix interface failure behavior, cohesive zone module (cohesive surface/cohesive element) of Abaqus® is used. In order to capture the epoxy matrix stiffness and strength degradation, the following two different approaches are used: (i) initially, the linear Drucker–Prager plasticity model in combination with a ductile fracture criterion is used; (ii) later, a brittle failure approach such as the quadratic normal stress criterion within the framework of eXtended finite element method is used. From the detailed micromechanical analysis of the RVE, it is observed that the initial damage in the RVE occurs in the form of fiber/matrix interface decohesion. With increasing tensile load, interface crack propagates and creates a stress concentration region in the matrix material, adjacent to the crack tip. Further load application causes both interface crack tip and matrix stress concentration to move away from the load application direction. As soon as the interface crack tip reaches approximately 60° to 70° away from the load application direction, the conjunction of the matrix damage with the interface crack leads to the RVE final failure. The predicted average stress–strain curves from the above-mentioned two different epoxy matrix failure criterions (ductile and brittle) correlate very well with the experimental results, indicating that the brittle failure behavior of a UD fiber-reinforced plastic composite ply under transverse tensile load is mainly controlled by the fiber/matrix interface properties.

N2 - Abstract This paper describes the comparison between experimental and computational results for the flow in an inlet system that contains a plenum. Here, the main focus is on the details of the computations and the comparison with experimental results for flow in the plenum. Details of the experiment are described elsewhere. By varying mesh density, boundary conditions, discretization schemes and turbulence models, a wide-ranging study of the accuracy of computational techniques for an industrial problem has been made. In particular, levels of mesh refinement for converged numerical solutions have been determined, together with performance levels for the various settings used. In terms of velocity prediction, when the flow is driven by boundary conditions specified at the outlet more accurate results are achieved. This is due to the flow at the inlet being calculated more accurately in these cases. The effects of different discretization schemes and turbulence models on the velocity predictions are small. Pressure predictions are, however, improved by more complex turbulence models such as the renormalization group (RNG) model.

N2 - Increasing calls for greater STEM-integrated experiences in K–12 education have spawned numerous studies on teacher beliefs, educational goals, and practices for teaching and learning. However, how the field proposes to support the development of teachers’ STEM-integrated disciplinary knowledge appears to be underresearched. In this systematic review, we analyzed 110 articles to determine (a) in what ways has the literature focused on teacher learning, (b) to what extent the literature addressed the development of teachers’ STEM-integrated disciplinary knowledge, and (c) to what extent the literature identified mechanisms for developing teachers’ STEM-integrated disciplinary knowledge. Results reveal needs that include, among others, more studies focused on developing teacher disciplinary knowledge; studies that differentiate teacher needs at different grade levels; studies that differentiate mechanisms aimed at developing teachers’ pedagogical knowledge, pedagogical content knowledge, and disciplinary knowledge; and studies that explicitly examine the mechanisms being used to support the development of teachers’ STEM-integrated disciplinary knowledge.
