abstract = {Monitoring of patient’s health in the medical industry can be enabled using wireless body area networks (WBANs), which are already used for various purposes, including assisting in human safety. It is imperative to use better power management strategies since the body sensors are small and the battery cannot hold a charge for a long time. Due to the vast amounts of information generated by medical sensors, resource-constrained networks face a significant challenge when guaranteeing the specified quality of service (QoS). Moreover, the WBAN regularly meets the primary hassle of QoS degradation because of congestion WBAN structure can easily compromise heterogeneous and complex networks. Either inappropriate data collection or using energy effectively to transmit medical data without the expense of travel and length has become an important one. To address this issue, the present research work ‘Link Quality and Energy Efficient Optimal Clustering-Multipath (LEOC-MP)’ scheme tries to explore an answer. The main goals of the LEOC-MP (Optimal Link Quality and Energy Efficient Optimal Clustering-Multipath) system are to guarantee node-to-node link quality, lengthen network life, and compute high-performing cluster heads to guarantee reliable multi path data transfer. This work was executed in three phases. First, an optimal simplified clustering technique for data collection from body sensors using an improved pelican optimization (ICO) algorithm is introduced. Next, multiple design constraints for node rank computation, energy efficiency, link quality, path loss, distance, and delay are used. Besides, an Auto-Regressive Probabilistic Neural Network (AR-PNN) is introduced to optimize those design constraints and compute the cluster head (CH) of each cluster. Multipath firing is then performed using a moderated puffer-fish optimization (MPO) algorithm that finds the closest optimal and shortest node to transmit optimal drug data. The work is simulated using an NS-3 environment, and the results are obtained. The outcome of this work is analyzed with existing methodologies, and the results prove that the present work consistently outperforms the existing methodologies.}

abstract = {Background
Computational simulation of biological processes can be a valuable tool for accelerating biomedical research, but usually requires extensive domain knowledge and manual adaptation. Large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have proven surprisingly successful for a wide range of tasks. This study provides proof-of-concept for the use of GPT-4 as a versatile simulator of biological systems.
Methods
We introduce SimulateGPT, a proof-of-concept for knowledge-driven simulation across levels of biological organization through structured prompting of GPT-4. We benchmarked our approach against direct GPT-4 inference in blinded qualitative evaluations by domain experts in four scenarios and in two quantitative scenarios with experimental ground truth. The qualitative scenarios included mouse experiments with known outcomes and treatment decision support in sepsis. The quantitative scenarios included prediction of gene essentiality in cancer cells and progression-free survival in cancer patients.
Results
In qualitative experiments, biomedical scientists rated SimulateGPT's predictions favorably over direct GPT-4 inference. In quantitative experiments, SimulateGPT substantially improved classification accuracy for predicting the essentiality of individual genes and increased correlation coefficients and precision in the regression task of predicting progression-free survival.
Conclusion
This proof-of-concept study suggests that LLMs may enable a new class of biomedical simulators. Such text-based simulations appear well suited for modeling and understanding complex living systems that are difficult to describe with physics-based first-principles simulations, but for which extensive knowledge is available as written text. Finally, we propose several directions for further development of LLM-based biomedical simulators, including augmentation through web search retrieval, integrated mathematical modeling, and fine-tuning on experimental data.}

Choice Awareness is based on the understanding that existing institutional perceptions and organizational interests will often seek to eliminate certain choices from the political decision-making process, when the introduction of radical technological change is discussed. The counterstrategy is to raise public awareness that alternatives do exist and that it is possible to make a choice. Counterstrategies may involve the design of technical alternatives, feasibility studies based on institutional economic thinking, and the design of public regulation measures seen in the light of conflicting interests as well as changes in the democratic decision-making infrastructure. Each of the strategies is elaborated on in this chapter.}

The model of each cerebral region involved in recognizing is established respectively and a feedforward method for establishing category mental imagery is proposed. First, the model of feature acquisition is developed based on Hubel-Wiesel model, and Gaussian function is used to simulate the simple cell receptive field to satisfy the specific function of visual cortex. Second, multiple input aggregation operation is employed to simulate the feature output of complex cells to get the invariance representation in feature space. Then, imagery basis is extracted by unsupervised learning algorithm based on the primary feature and category mental imagery is obtained by building Radial Basis Function (RBF) network. Finally, the system model is tested by training set and test set composed of real images. Experimental results show that the proposed method can establish valid deep representation of these samples, based on which the biomimetic construction of category mental imagery can be achieved. This method provides a new idea for solving imagery problem and studying imagery thinking.}

Here we investigate whether this technique can be used to decode not only participants' own intentions, but also their representation of the intentions held by other people. In other words: if Sam is thinking about Hoki, can we decode the content of Hoki's intention by scanning Sam's brain? We additionally distinguished two components of intentions: action-plans versus goals, and included novel control analyses that allowed us to distinguish intending an outcome from simply expecting it to occur or simulating its consequences. Regions of frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex contained patterns from which it was possible to decode intentions of both self and other. Furthermore, crossclasification between self and other was possible, suggesting overlap between the two. Control analyses suggested that these results reflected visuo-spatial processes by which intentions were generated in our paradigm, rather than anything special about intentions per se. There was no evidence for any representation of intentions as mental states distinct from visuospatial processes involved in generating their content and/or simulating their outcomes. These findings suggest that the brain activity patterns decoded in intention-decoding fMRI studies may reflect domain-general processes rather than being intention-specific.}

Important decisions often involve choosing between complex environments that define future item encounters. Despite its importance for adaptive behavior and distinct computational challenges, decision-making research primarily focuses on item choice, ignoring environment choice altogether. Here we contrast previously studied item choice in ventromedial prefrontal cortex with lateral frontopolar cortex (FPl) linked to environment choice. Furthermore, we propose a mechanism for how FPl decomposes and represents complex environments during decision making. Specifically, we trained a choice-optimized, brain-naive convolutional neural network (CNN) and compared predicted CNN activation with actual FPl activity. We showed that the high-dimensional FPl activity decomposes environment features to represent the complexity of an environment to make such choice possible. Moreover, FPl functionally connects with posterior cingulate cortex for guiding environment choice. Further probing FPl’s computation revealed a parallel processing mechanism in extracting multiple environment features.}

This paper analyses the assumptions and expectations that animate expert understandings of mCDR, with a focus on issues that are central to the responsible governance of this emerging field of climate action. Drawing upon interviews with experts involved in mCDR research projects both academic and entrepreneurial, we highlight four thematic tensions that orient their thinking but are often unstated or left implicit in scientific and technical assessments: (1) the relevance of ‘naturalness’ as a criterion of evaluation for mCDR approaches; (2) the perceived need to accelerate research and development activities via alternative paradigms of evidence-building; (3) a framing of mCDR as a form of waste management that will, in turn, generate new (and currently poorly understood) forms of environmental pollutants; and (4) a commitment to inclusive governance mixed with difficulty in identifying specific stakeholders or constituencies in mCDR interventions. Although expert consensus on these four issues is unlikely, we suggest ways of ensuring that consideration of these themes enriches debate on the responsible development of novel mCDR capabilities.}

In this brief historical overview, viewed through the lens of artificial intelligence (AI), we propose that comprehending the reasoning behind AI can enhance our understanding of clinical reasoning. Our objective is to systematically identify the factors that shape clinical reasoning in medicine, based on six factors that were historically considered beyond the reach of statistical methods: open-endedness, unanalyzed stimulus-equivalences, empty cells, theory mediation, insufficient time, and highly configured functions. Nevertheless, a pertinent consideration in the age of AI is whether these once-considered insurmountable specific factors of clinicians are now subject to scrutiny or not. Through example in AI, we demonstrate that a deeper understanding of these factors not only sheds light on clinical decision-making and its heuristic processes but also underscores the significance of collaboration between AI experts and healthcare professionals. This comparison between AI and clinical reasoning contributes to a better grasp of the current challenges AI faces in the realm of clinical medicine.}

In this article, we propose a generative framework that entails a computational mechanism which, when implemented in a virtual agent and given new information, generates belief updates (i.e., inferences about the hidden causes of the information) that resemble those seen in individuals with delusions. We introduce a particular form of Dirichlet process mixture model with a sampling-based Bayesian inference algorithm. This procedure, depending on the setting of a single parameter, preferentially generates highly precise (i.e. over-fitting) explanations, which are compartmentalized and thus can co-exist despite being inconsistent with each other. Especially in ambiguous situations, this can provide the seed for delusional ideation. Further, we show by simulation how the excessive generation of such over-precise explanations leads to new information being integrated in a way that does not lead to a revision of established beliefs. In all configurations, whether delusional or not, the inference generated by our algorithm corresponds to Bayesian inference. Furthermore, the algorithm is fully compatible with hierarchical predictive coding. By virtue of these properties, the proposed model provides a basis for the empirical study and a step toward the characterization of the aberrant inferential processes underlying delusions.}

Propositional list structures are used to represent verbal information and reasoning. Small individual pieces from the different representations are linked on a sequential and temporary basis to form a reasoning and inferencing chain, using visually encoded information recalled to the Mind's Eye from long-term memory and from cues recognized on an external display. CaMeRa, like the expert, uses the diagrammatic and verbal representations to complement one another, thus exploiting the unique advantages of each.}

These facilitate a more open-ended, multi-dimensional approach that incorporates diverse stakeholders to shape the potential of a collective intelligent operating system — one that best reflects the inherent nature of each unique city and urban condition. The design of smart cities must incorporate and adapt a combination of universal standards and localized policies through global civil society organizations and public-private-people partnerships established to serve the user and citizen as participants of the living city. New methods including co-design, co-creation, citizen participation and user experience (UX) feedback foster inclusive cities. Living labs and innovation hubs provide opportunities and spaces to prototype such initiatives. Transdisciplinary approaches are needed more than ever to expand our scope of inclusion to all life forms, including the rights of animals and nature as stakeholders. By applying a new combination of human and AI-enabled methods such as design thinking, machine learning and generative design, cities can now augment and improve their current state seamlessly, integrating technologies and management as an autopoietic smart city operating system.}

It then discusses the use and value of GIS in transportation modeling in three areas: (1) GIS for the four-step transportation models and for specific transportation modeling interests such as accessibility modeling and land use-transportation integrated (LUTI) modeling; (2) GIS visualization capabilities for presenting transportation modeling output and for facilitating visual thinking and knowledge construction; and (3) the potential of and challenges to GIS in transportation modeling amid rapid development of big-data technologies and new mobility.}

abstract = {The application of Circular Economy to construction sector is a key to attain carbon neutrality, since it is responsible of 40 % of natural resource consumption. In this frame the importance of an efficient building refurbishment process throughout recycled material and renewable energy is fundamental. From an overview about building refurbishment emerges the need to investigate aspects related to Indoor Environmental Quality and the comparison between in-field measurements with output of dynamic simulation models. The present study aims to fill these two gaps by means an energy renovation of two real buildings in Greece. The work develops within the European project “Drive 0″, born to promote deep environmentally friendly retrofitting by means of circular renovation concepts. The methodological approach involves on-site monitoring of a series of parameters describing the energy, microclimate environmental and air quality, before and after the energy requalification. In addition, a numerical model developed in Building Energy Simulation program is calibrated and a Computational Fluid Dynamics is developed. From the in-field measurements emerges that, on one hand, the refurbishment of heating system shows a great improvement of indoor thermal conditions, with Total Volatile Organic Compounds concentration that sometimes exceed 3.0 mg/m3; on the other hand an integrated thermal insulation reduces infiltrations and changes the envelope behaviour, with a global energy saving of 30 % during winter and autumn periods. Another result of the study shows that a numerical model developed in Building Energy Simulation program and calibrated on energy consumption can greatly fit the local thermal comfort distribution of the occupant zone and predict the indoor air quality, if it outputs are used as input data in a Computational Fluid Dynamics study. These results can be beneficial to decision makers and designers for evaluating emitters positioning, opening design and mechanical ventilation strategies, aimed at reducing energy costs.}

This study applied two machine learning algorithms, Lasso Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF), to predict the mathematics literacy of resilient students from high-performing economies across cultures in PISA 2022. The findings indicated both RF and LR performed better in Western cultures than in Eastern cultures. Furthermore, in Eastern cultures, mathematics self-efficacy for 21st-century skills played an important role in predicting resilient students’ mathematics literacy, followed by self-efficacy towards mathematics, and mathematics anxiety. In Western cultures, self-efficacy towards mathematics was the predominant predictor, followed by mathematics self-efficacy for 21st-century skills. Theoretically, this study identifies key factors in predicting resilient students’ mathematics literacy across cultures. Methodologically, it is the first to apply ML in exploring resilient students’ mathematics literacy. Practically, it guides educators interested in developing interventions to improve resilient students’ mathematics literacy.}

Here, we integrate new findings of index neurons in humans and other animals with the concept-specific memory framework, proposing that concept neurons evolve from index neurons through overlapping memories. This process is supported by engram literature, which posits that neurons are allocated to a memory trace based on excitability and that reactivation induces excitability. By integrating these insights, we connect two historically disparate fields of neuroscience: engram research and human single neuron episodic memory research.}

Debriefing for Meaningful Learning (DML), an evidence-based debriefing method, promotes thinking like a nurse through reflective learning. Despite widespread adoption of DML, little is known about how well it is implemented. To assess the effectiveness of DML implementation, an evaluative rubric was developed and tested.
Sample
Three debriefers who had been trained to use DML at least 1 year previously, submitted five recorded debriefings each for evaluation.
Methods
Three raters who were experts in DML scored each of the 15 recorded debriefing session using DML Evaluation Scale (DMLES). Observable behaviors were scored with binary options. These raters also assessed the items in the DMLES for content validity.
Results
Cronbach's alpha, intraclass correlation coefficients, and Content Validity Index scores were calculated to determine reliability and validity.
Conclusion
Use of DMLES could support quality improvement, teacher preparation, and faculty development. Future testing is warranted to investigate the relationship between DML implementation and clinical reasoning.}

The later compound was first to be isolated from family Moringaceae. Compounds identification was guided by interplay of NMR and HR-ESI-MS analysis. Anti-epileptic studies conducted in vivo showed that the extract attenuates convulsions by suppressing stress–induced pro-inflammatory markers TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and IFN-ɣ whereas upregulating the anti-inflammatory markers TGF-β and IL-10 in the hippocampal tissues of epileptic rats. The isolated compounds were subjected to computational studies through docking on lactate dehydrogenase A(LDH) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), where all showed binding modes and interaction energies comparable to those of the reference drug diazepam. ADME investigation revealed good pharmacokinetic and drug-likeness properties. These results show that Moringa oleifera seeds could potentially be used as adjuvant in the management of epilepsy.}

Computational technologies and Artificial Intelligence (AI) promise to overcome WGM challenges, supporting mosquito identification. AI explores computers' thinking capacity, originating in the 1950s. Machine Learning (ML) arose in the 1980s as a subfield of AI, and deep Learning (DL) characterizes ML's subcategory, featuring hierarchical data processing layers. DL relies on data volume and layer adjustments. Over the past decade, AI demonstrated potential in mosquito identification. Various studies employed optical sensors, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for mosquito identification, achieving average accuracy rates between 84 % and 93 %. Furthermore, larval Aedes identification reached accuracy rates of 92 % to 94 % using CNNs. DL models such as ResNet50 and VGG16 achieved up to 95 % accuracy in mosquito identification. Applying CNNs to georeference mosquito photos showed promising results. AI algorithms automated landmark detection in various insects' wings with repeatability rates exceeding 90 %. Companies have developed wing landmark detection algorithms, marking significant advancements in the field. In this review, we discuss how AI and WGM are being combined to identify mosquito species, offering benefits in monitoring and controlling mosquito populations.}

In so doing, they have probed a range of phenomena crucial to cybersecurity; from technical processes such as encryption, malware infection, and threat detection, to the social arrangements and negotiations between various organizations and states, the implications of surveillance and big data on privacy, and how threats affect various infrastructure that support ways of life across the globe. Nevertheless, geographers do not simply consider cybersecurity as a mode of security imposed “online” or through digital technologies. Rather, in its practice, geographers have demonstrated how cybersecurity involves and invokes socio-political complications around criminality, protection, inequalities, privacy, surveillance, private enterprise, and the role of the state in the life of citizens.}

Software engineering research aims to establish software development practice on a scientific basis. However, the evidence of the efficacy of technology is insufficient to ensure its uptake in industry. In the absence of a theoretical frame of reference, we mainly rely on best practices and expert judgment from industry-academia collaboration and software process improvement research to improve the acceptance of the proposed technology.
Objective:
To identify acceptance models and theories and discuss their applicability in the research of acceptance behavior related to software development.
Method:
We analyzed literature reviews within an interdisciplinary team to identify models and theories relevant to software engineering research. We further discuss acceptance behavior from the human information processing perspective of automatic and affect-driven processes (“fast” system 1 thinking) and rational and rule-governed processes (“slow” system 2 thinking).
Results:
We identified 30 potentially relevant models and theories. Several of them have been used in researching acceptance behavior in contexts related to software development, but few have been validated in such contexts. They use constructs that capture aspects of (automatic) system 1 and (rational) system 2 oriented processes. However, their operationalizations focus on system 2 oriented processes indicating a rational view of behavior, thus overlooking important psychological processes underpinning behavior.
Conclusions:
Software engineering research may use acceptance behavior models and theories more extensively to understand and predict practice adoption in the industry. Such theoretical foundations will help improve the impact of software engineering research. However, more consideration should be given to their validation, overlap, construct operationalization, and employed data collection mechanisms when using these models and theories.}

Therefore, understanding the link between neurons and behaviour is a multi-level problem, which can be achieved when considering Marr’s three levels of understanding: behaviour, computation, and neural implementation. Rather than establishing direct links between neurons and behaviour, the matter boils down to understanding two transitions: the link between neurons and brain computation on one hand, and the link between brain computations and behaviour on the other hand. The field of insect navigation illustrates well the power of such two-sided endeavour. We provide here examples revealing that each transition requires its own approach with its own intrinsic difficulties, and show how modelling can help us reach the desired multi-level understanding.}

We fitted latent growth curve models separately for the development of frequency and distress of symptoms. CBT was significantly more successful than counselling in reducing delusional frequency in the short term and hallucinatory distress at any point, even in those with relatively high thought disorder. We found little evidence that clinicians should restrict CBT in this subgroup of patients.

When exhibiting the first type of sketching behavior, designers are able to transform their original sketches to satisfy requirements. Simulating this type of visual cognitive behavior by neural networks could help computers modify shapes to meet design requirements, as human designers do. When demonstrating the second type of sketching behavior, designers are able to see an ambiguous shape as different complete shapes so as to associate divergent design ideas. Another set of neural networks investigated in this study could also associate different shapes by adjusting the TSL and produce different idea sketches from the same shape.}

abstract = {This paper analyses the forecasting accuracy of experts vis-à-vis laypeople over three seasons of English Premier League matches. We find that former professional football players have superior forecasting ability when compared to laypeople. The results give partial support to the view that a crowd forecast offers the greatest precision. Pundits generate a positive return while both the crowd and laypeople generate losses. As the prediction of multiple score outcomes represents a computationally difficult task, both groups display forecasting biases including a preference toward specific score forecasts. The results are relevant for those concerned with gambling behaviour if the forecasting strategies adopted here generalise to match betting markets.}

While delivering impressive performances across various fields such as granular computing, cluster analysis, NL is argued to be computationally demanding, thereby limiting its utility and applicability. In this study, a simple and generic scheme named granular cabin is proposed for drastically speeding up the algorithmic implementation of NL. Specifically, this scheme is deployed to Neighborhood Rough Set (NRS) which is a typical NL methodology. And three major applications of NRS are concerned including approximation computation, neighborhood classification and feature selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NRS methodology enhanced by granular cabin consumes much less time. This study offers a promising solution that ensures the great potential of NL in big data.}

abstract = {Participation of stakeholders in stewardship of the aquatic environment, including participation from members of the general public, has become much more widespread than was the case a decade or so ago. With this shift, from a former predominantly technocratic stance to something of a democratic stance on the style of management, it becomes important to elucidate public perceptions of environmental behavior. The paper examines this issue: from a rather specific perspective, where the role of time is significant; with a specific purpose in mind—for defining illustrative stakeholder aspirations for the future, whose plausibility is to be assessed against a computational model of lake behavior; and for a specific case study, Lake Lanier in the Chattahoochee watershed of Georgia, USA. Perturbations and variation in the behavior of the aquatic environment span many time frames, from the very short-term response associated with storms, infrastructure failure, transient pollution events, and so on, to the much longer-term, for instance, the biogeochemical ‘ageing’ of a lake over many decades and more. Our analysis is devoted to data from a survey of stakeholder imagination and perceptions of how the future state of Lake Lanier may evolve in the relatively short term (2–5 years) and in the long term, defined as 25+ years (the span of a generation). Overall, stakeholders are pessimistic and fear that things will be worse in the longer term. Guided largely by thinking on the perspectives of the social solidarities of Cultural Theory, extraction and analysis of sub-samples of the survey responses show that this outlook over the two frames of time is persistent, irrespective of what are, in principle, rather different ‘global’ attitudes towards the man-environment relationship. Of interest inter alia to the foresight generating procedure, by which the ‘reachability’ of stakeholder-derived futures for the lake is to be assessed using a computational model of the relevant parts of the science base, is the question of whether the same small number of priorities for further research on lake behavior is robust in the face of the rich variety of aspirations for the future inevitable in a democratic community of stakeholders.}

abstract = {Three different approaches show that, contrary to a longstanding conviction older than 160 years, the advance of Mercury’s perihelion can be achieved in Newtonian gravity with a very high precision by correctly analyzing the situation without neglecting Mercury’s mass. General relativity remains more precise than Newtonian physics, but Newtonian framework is more powerful than researchers and astronomers were thinking till now, at least for the case of Mercury. The Newtonian formula of the advance of planets’ perihelion breaks down for the other planets. The predicted Newtonian result is indeed too large for Venus and Earth. Therefore, it is also shown that corrections due to gravitational and rotational time dilation, in an intermediate framework which analyzes gravity between Newton and Einstein, solve the problem. By adding such corrections, a result consistent with the one of general relativity is indeed obtained. Thus, the most important results of this paper are two: (i) It is not correct that Newtonian theory cannot predict the anomalous rate of precession of the perihelion of planets’ orbit. The real problem is instead that a pure Newtonian prediction is too large. (ii) Perihelion’s precession can be achieved with the same precision of general relativity by extending Newtonian gravity through the inclusion of gravitational and rotational time dilation effects. This second result is in agreement with a couple of recent and interesting papers of Hansen, Hartong and Obers. Differently from such papers, in the present work the importance of rotational time dilation is also highlighted. Finally, it is important to stress that a better understanding of gravitational effects in an intermediate framework between Newtonian theory and general relativity, which is one of the goals of this paper, could, in principle, be crucial for a subsequent better understanding of the famous Dark Matter and Dark Energy problems.}

To describe school cafeteria interventions in terms of a behavioral economics scheme and to assess which system is more likely to be effective in improving food selection or consumption.
Study design
With this systematic review, we categorize cafeteria interventions using the behavioral economics theory of Kahneman into system 1 (fast and intuitive thinking) and system 2 (slow and cognitively demanding) or mixed (having elements of system 1 and system 2). Pertinent studies were identified from review of the literature of interventions performed in school and cafeteria settings in children grades K-12 within the past 5 years (2012-2017) at time of search.
Results
In all, 48 of 978 studies met inclusion criteria. By defining success as a 30% improvement in a desired outcome or statistically significant reduction in body mass index, 89% of system 1, 67% of mixed (had both system 1 and 2 elements), and only 33% of system 2 interventions were successful.
Conclusions
This review found successful system 1 type school cafeteria interventions to be more common than system 2 type interventions and system 2 type interventions are less effective than system 1.}

In this perspective, expectations are updated (error minimization) only if sensory data sufficiently deviate from these expectations (prediction error). Although originally applied to perception, predictive processing is thought to generally characterize cognitive architecture, including the social cognitive processes involved in ideological thinking. Scaling up these simple computational principles to the social sphere outlines a path by which group members may adopt shared ideologies and beliefs to predict behavior and cooperate with each other. Because ideological judgments are of specific interest to others in our political groups, we may increasingly regulate each other’s thinking, sharing the process of error minimization. In this paper, we outline how this process of shared error minimization may lead to shared ideologies and beliefs that allow group members to predict and cooperate with each other, and how, as a consequence, political polarization and extremism may result.}

To this end, a foresight exercise is conducted with marine scientists and researchers in 6 countries in Europe. The exercise is designed in three stages: scanning, scenario-building and strategic orientation, and uses a combination of foresight methods to encourage creative thinking and exploration. The scenarios developed in the study describe alternative future worlds built on the establishment of self-sustaining communities and engaged societies; the diffusion of digitalisation and growth of blue biotechnologies; booming ecosystem services and open and collaborative research infrastructures that impact different sectors of the blue economy. A portfolio of research and innovation areas is developed that aims to inspire new research directions in four domains: (i) integrated ocean management tools; (ii) closed loop, circular polyculture systems; (iii) co-creation of innovation and transdisciplinary research; and (iv) open access and collaborative databases supporting ecosystem services. The study highlights the role of foresight in bridging across disciplinary perspectives and industry sectors. Foresight can be used to complement Decision-Support Systems and other quantitative approaches for research agenda-setting and for decision-making on policies addressing sustainability in the marine sciences.

Applying a complex systems perspective to public health evaluation may increase the relevance and strength of evidence to improve health and reduce health inequalities. In this review of methods, we aimed to: (i) classify and describe different complex systems methods in evaluation applied to public health; and (ii) examine the kinds of evaluative evidence generated by these different methods.
Methods
We adapted critical review methods to identify evaluations of public health interventions that used systems methods. We conducted expert consultation, searched electronic databases (Scopus, MEDLINE, Web of Science), and followed citations of relevant systematic reviews. Evaluations were included if they self-identified as using systems- or complexity-informed methods and if they evaluated existing or hypothetical public health interventions. Case studies were selected to illustrate different types of complex systems evaluation.
Findings
Seventy-four unique studies met our inclusion criteria. A framework was developed to map the included studies onto different stages of the evaluation process, which parallels the planning, delivery, assessment, and further delivery phases of the interventions they seek to inform; these stages include: 1) theorising; 2) prediction (simulation); 3) process evaluation; 4) impact evaluation; and 5) further prediction (simulation). Within this framework, we broadly categorised methodological approaches as mapping, modelling, network analysis and ‘system framing’ (the application of a complex systems perspective to a range of study designs). Studies frequently applied more than one type of systems method.
Conclusions
A range of complex systems methods can be utilised, adapted, or combined to produce different types of evaluative evidence. Further methodological innovation in systems evaluation may generate stronger evidence to improve health and reduce health inequalities in our complex world.}

The most common symptoms of AD are losing memory and early aging. In addition to these, there are several serious impacts of AD. However, the impact of AD can be mitigated by early-stage detection though it cannot be cured permanently. Early-stage detection is the most challenging task for controlling and mitigating the impact of AD. The study proposes a predictive model to detect AD in the initial phase based on machine learning and a deep learning approach to address the issue. To build a predictive model, open-source data was collected where five stages of images of AD were available as Cognitive Normal (CN), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI), Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI), and AD. Every stage of AD is considered as a class, and then the dataset was divided into three parts binary class, three class, and five class. In this research, we applied different preprocessing steps with augmentation techniques to efficiently identify AD. It integrates a random oversampling technique to handle the imbalance problem from target classes, mitigating the model overfitting and biases. Then three machine learning classifiers, such as random forest (RF), K-Nearest neighbor (KNN), and support vector machine (SVM), and two deep learning methods, such as convolutional neuronal network (CNN) and artificial neural network (ANN) were applied on these datasets. After analyzing the performance of the used models and the datasets, it is found that CNN with binary class outperformed 88.20% accuracy. The result of the study indicates that the model is highly potential to detect AD in the initial phase.}

The collected big data normally have been treated by unsupervised Machine Learning methods. However, the process is time consuming and lacks consideration of time continuity. From the unknown data to recognize and recur the ship behaviors is still a complex problem. Hence, this study proposes a universal Meta-trajectory Variable Sliding Window (Meta-VSW) method to provide an efficient and high-fidelity solution. In this method, the ship data were connected into the smallest units by the meta-trajectory coding, and combines with variable sliding windows to achieve fast, continuous and accurate recognition of ship behaviors. Taking an inland-water ship and a marine transport ship as examples, the validity of the method was fulfilled and compared with two commonly used algorithms, Affinity Propagation (AP) and Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN). It has the fastest computational speed and can effectively classify the behaviors of massive unknown data from different ships. And it has good performance in capturing behavior boundaries, with the recognition accuracy up to 0.9. Then, the method was applied to analyze the operational effectively and fuel consumption.}

Weight falls on intermediary systems or adaptors that enable translated DNA to function within a cellular apparatus. Specifically, code intermediaries bridge between independent worlds (e.g. those of RNAs and proteins) to grant functional lee-way to the resulting products. Using this Organic Code (OC) model, the paper draws parallels with how people use artificial codes. As illustrated by Tetris and Morse, human players/signallers manage code functionality by using bodies as (or like) adaptors. They act as coding intermediaries who use lee-way alongside “a small set of arbitrary rules selected from a potentially unlimited number in order to ensure a specific correspondence between two independent worlds” (Barbieri, 2015). As with deep learning, networked bodily systems mesh inputs from a coded past with current inputs. Received models reduce ‘use’ of codes to a run-time or program like process. They overlook how molecular memory is extended by living apparatuses that link codes with functioning adaptors. In applying the OC model to humans, the paper connects Turing’s (1937) view of thinking to Wilson’s (2004) appeal to wide cognition. The approach opens up a new view of Kirsh and Maglio’s (1994) seminal studies on Tetris. As players use an interface that actualizes a code or program, their goal-directed (i.e. ‘pragmatic’) actions co-occur with adaptor-like ‘filling in’ (i.e. ‘epistemic’ moves). In terms of the OC model, flexible functions derive from, not actions, but epistemic dynamics that arise in the human-interface-computer system. Second, I pursue how a Morse radio operator uses dibs and dabs that enable the workings of an artificial code. While using knowledge (‘the rules’) to resemiotize by tapping on a transmission key, bodily dynamics are controlled by adaptor-like resources. Finally, turning to language, I sketch how the model applies to writing and reading. Like Morse operators, writers resemiotize a code-like domain of alphabets, spelling-systems etc. by acting as (or like) bodily adaptors. Further, in attending to a text-interface (symbolizations), a reader relies on filling-in that is (or feels) epistemic. Given that humans enact or mimic adaptor functions, it is likely that the OC model also applies to multi-modal language.}

abstract = {Negatively charged genomic DNA wraps around positively charged core histone octamers to form nucleosomes, which, along with proteins and RNAs, self-organize into chromatin within the nucleus. In eukaryotic cells, chromatin forms loops that collapse into chromatin domains and serve as functional units of the genome. Chromatin domains vary in physical properties based on gene activity and are assembled into A (euchromatin) and B (heterochromatin) compartments. Since various factors—such as chromatin-binding proteins, histone modifications, transcriptional states, depletion attraction, and cations—can significantly impact chromatin organization, the formation processes of these hierarchical structures remain unclear. No single imaging, genomics, or modeling method can provide a complete picture of the process. Beautiful models can sometimes fool our thinking. In this short review, we critically discuss the formation mechanisms of the chromatin domain in the cell from a physical point of view, including phase separation and condensation.}

abstract = {With applications ranging from manufacturing and healthcare to urban planning and energy, digital twin technology has become a ground-breaking idea. In order to provide light on the potential breakthroughs and obstacles that lie ahead, this study examines future trends and research challenges in the field of digital twins. Several significant themes are anticipated to influence the development of digital twins as they continue to change. Digital twins will be better able to learn from complex situations in real time because to the combination of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML). Digital twins will be given the ability to foresee, improve, and react to dynamic changes as a result of this AI-driven evolution, which will ultimately result in more effective and resilient systems. Another important development is the idea of federated digital twins, in which various interconnected digital twin instances work together to represent a larger, interconnected system. By integrating the strengths of several digital twins, this method makes it easier to model and analyze very complex and interconnected systems, such as smart cities or multimodal transportation networks. It is also projected that digital twins would spread into the Internet of Things (IoT) space. A closer connection between the real and virtual worlds will be made possible by the seamless integration of sensors, actuators, and data streams with digital twin platforms. This pattern will open the door to fresh perspectives and opportunities for improvement. To fully realize the potential of digital twins, a number of scientific challenges must be overcome. As the integration of real-time data from physical systems raises worries about unauthorized access and potential vulnerabilities, data privacy and security continue to be of the utmost importance. Additionally, sophisticated methods for data assimilation, model validation, and uncertainty quantification are needed to create accurate and trustworthy digital twin models. Another urgent issue is interoperability. The creation of standardized interfaces and protocols is essential to facilitate seamless integration and data sharing as digital twins proliferate across many sectors and domains. Furthermore, novel approaches to distributed computing and high-performance simulation are necessary to meet the scalability and computational requirements of large-scale digital twin ecosystems. In-depth analysis of these trends and problems is provided in this chapter, along with suggestions for future research areas and solutions. The field of digital twins is set for a paradigm-shifting impact on how we build, function, and interact with the physical world by tackling these issues and exploiting new trends.}

abstract = {Because of the increasing presence of intelligent agents in various aspects of human social life, social skills play a vital role in ensuring these systems exhibit acceptable and realistic behavior in social communication. The importance of emotional intelligence in social capabilities is noteworthy, so incorporating emotions into the behaviors of intelligent agents is essential. Therefore, some computational models of emotions have been presented to develop intelligent agents that exhibit emotional human-like behaviors. However, most current computational models of emotions neglect the dynamic learning of the affective meaning of events based on agents’ experiences. Such models evaluate the events in the environment according to emotional aspects without considering the context of the situations. Also, these models capture the emotional states of agents by using predefined rules determined according to psychological theories. Therefore, they disregard the data-driven methods that can obtain the relationships between appraisal variables and emotions based on natural human data with fewer assumptions on the nature of such relationships. To address these issues, we proposed a novel and unified affective-cognitive framework (EIAEC) to facilitate the development of emotion-aware intelligent agents. EIAEC uses appraisal theories to acquire the emotional states of the agent in various situations. This paper contains four main contributions: 1- We have designed an efficient episodic memory that uses events and their conditional contexts to store and retrieve knowledge and experiences. This memory facilitates emotional expressions and decision-making adapted to the situations of the agent. 2- A novel method has been proposed that learns context-dependent affective values associated with events by using the agent’s experiences in various contexts. Subsequently, we acquired appraisal variables using the elements and related meta-data in episodic memory. 3- We have proposed a new data-driven method that maps appraisal variables to emotional states. 4- Moreover, a method has been developed to update the activation values regarding actions by using the emotional states of the agent. This method models the influence of emotions on the agent’s decision-making. Finally, we simulate a driving scenarios in our proposed framework to manifest the generated emotions in different situations and conditions. Moreover, we show how the proposed method learns the affective meaning of events and actions used in appraisal computing.}

Forward planning expands decision trees from the current state towards simulated futures, while backward planning starts the tree expansion from specific goal points in the opposite direction. Previous research has highlighted the impact of Pavlovian approach bias on behavior, showing that animals move towards appetitive outcomes regardless of the appropriateness of such behavior for achieving those outcomes. However, it remains unexplored whether the Pavlovian approach influences behavior by biasing backward planning. This research introduces a spatial navigation task to investigate the involvement of backward planning in humans’ action-selection process and to determine whether the Pavlovian approach biases behavior through backward planning. The results reveal the behavioral signature of backward planning in humans and show that Pavlovian approach bias can influence both forward and backward planning, leading to decisions that are not necessarily instrumentally more efficient. Additionally, we developed a bidirectional planning algorithm based on reinforcement learning to simulate the participants’ decisions. The simulation results suggest that the observed behavioral patterns can be parsimoniously explained by assuming that the Pavlovian approach bias acts as a pruning mechanism when expanding decision trees in both forward and backward directions.}

The two experiments and computational models reported here were designed to examine whether adults engage in one form of causal inference called backwards blocking reasoning, whether the presence of potential distractors affects performance, and how adults' ratings align with the predictions of different computational models. The results revealed that adults engaged in backwards blocking reasoning regardless of whether distractor objects are present and that their causal judgements supported the predictions of a Bayesian model but not the predictions of two different associative learning models. Implications of these results are discussed.}

This paper is about how well it has worked. This is reported in relation to two standards: (1) the value to thinking and action expressed by farmers and their consultants, (2) correspondence with theory about learning and judgement in uncertain external environments. The former utilises recorded narrative interviews with participants over many years. The latter uses a cognitive framework drawn from theory of judgment and decision making featuring the relationship between intuition and analysis (McCown, 2011). The cognitive theory framework makes sense of several evaluation surprises. The first was high enthusiasm by largely-intuitive farmers for an analytic approach to soil water in conjunction with a newly-appreciated “bucket” metaphor for water balance. The second surprise was the virtual absence of soil water measurement 10years later. This had been replaced by various intuitive estimates, calibrated to maintain a heuristic relationship with regard to the “bucket” as a resource. Farmers and their advisers were facilitated in using simulation for thought experiments and planning under climatic uncertainty. Benchmarking enabled problem solving in documented conditions. Scenario analysis using historical climate records supported thought experiments by providing probability distributions that were valued for shaping expectations as a “history of the future”. In retrospective evaluation interviews, researchers were surprised to find that yield forecasting and tactical decision making, anticipated to be analyses that were both site- and season-specific forecasts, had served farmers as “management gaming” simulations to aid formulating action rules for such conditions, thus reducing the need for an on-going decision-aiding service. Equipped with their soil monitoring techniques and with their heuristic rules, farmers still reserved a place for simulation “when you’ve got a planting situation out of the ordinary.”}

Early theories in the 1950s posited that strict ideological doctrines may tend to attract individuals with dispositions towards mental rigidity. This question has persisted: Does psychological rigidity foster a tendency towards ideological extremism? This review evaluates the empirical landscape with respect to the rigidity-of-the-extreme and the rigidity-of-the-right hypotheses and offers conceptual and methodological recommendations for future research avenues. The evidence suggests that cognitive rigidity is linked to ideological extremism, partisanship, and dogmatism across political and non-political ideologies. Advances in the measurement of ideological extremity and cognitive rigidity will facilitate further elucidation regarding how exactly the two hypotheses may be reconciled and why they have been historically placed in a potentially false competition. This synthesis suggests that a scientifically rigorous understanding of the cognitive roots of ideological thinking may be essential for developing effective antidotes to intolerance and intergroup hostility.}

However, previous scales have been insufficient to measure the extent of individuals' dependence on LLMs. The current study aims to utilize the human-computer trust model and addiction theory to develop and validate the LLMs dependence scale (LDS) and to report its psychometric properties. An exploratory structural investigation of LLMs dependence was conducted with a sample of 421 LLMs users (Sample 1), which included items analysis, exploratory factor analysis, and network analysis. Additionally, a formal test was performed with a separate sample of 1030 LLMs users (Sample 2), with the data undergoing structural validation through confirmatory factor analysis, validity testing, and reliability testing. To mitigate the potential negative impacts of LLMs dependence, we employed the NodeIdentifyR algorithm for computational simulation interventions to identify critical intervention nodes within the LLMs dependence network. The results indicated that the LDS (18 items) exhibited a bifactor structure of functional dependence and existential dependence. The confirmatory factor model demonstrated a good fit and the LDS also showed good criterion-related validity. Subsequent simulated results of alleviating interventions suggested that users' existential dependence was primarily driven by their dependence on LLMs to handle tedious and boring tasks, while functional dependence was more influenced by users' belief in the omnipotence of LLMs. In summary, the factor structure of the LDS is clear, and its reliability and validity indices meet psychometric standards, making it an effective tool for measuring LLMs dependence.}

ERPs were recorded while participants sub-vocally produced high- and low-frequency disyllabic words that do or do not require sandhi. Sandhi words elicited more positive ERPs than non-sandhi words over left anterior channels around 336–520 ms after participants saw the cue instructing them to initiate sub-vocal production, but this effect was not significantly modulated by word frequency.

From maps sketched in sand to supercomputing software, humans ubiquitously enhance cognitive performance by creating and using artifacts that bear mental load [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. This extension of information processing into the environment has taken center stage in debates about the nature of cognition in humans and other animals [6, 7, 8, 9]. How does the human mind acquire such strategies? In two experiments, we investigated the developmental origins of cognitive offloading in 150 children aged between 4 and 11 years. We created a memory task in which children were required to recall the location of hidden targets. In one experiment, participants were provided with a pre-specified cognitive offloading opportunity: an option to mark the target locations with tokens during the hiding period. Even 4-year-old children quickly adopted this external strategy and, in line with a metacognitive account, children across ages offloaded more often when the task was more difficult. In a second experiment, we provided children with the means to devise their own cognitive offloading strategy. Very few younger children spontaneously devised a solution, but by ages 10 and 11, nearly all did so. In a follow-up test phase, a simple prompt greatly increased the rate at which the younger children devised an offloading strategy. These findings suggest that sensitivity to the difficulties of thinking arises early in development and improves throughout the early school years, with children learning to modify the world around them to compensate for their cognitive limits.}

abstract = {This paper argues that evolutionary thinking and modeling can contribute to the emerging research on sustainability transitions and their management. Evolutionary theory provides a range of concepts and mechanisms that are useful in making existing theorizing about transitions more precise and complete. In particular, we will discuss how the multi-level, multi-phase, co-evolutionary, and social learning dynamics underlying transitions can be addressed in evolutionary models. In addition, evolutionary theorizing offers suggestions for extending current theoretical frameworks of transitions. Group selection provides a good example. We review the small set of formal evolutionary models of sustainability transitions, and show that existing formal evolutionary models of technological, social and institutional change can provide useful inputs to transition research and management.}

abstract = {Proteins constitute the building blocks of biological materials such as tendon, bone, skin, spider silk or cells. An important trait of these materials is that they display highly characteristic hierarchical structures, across multiple scales, from nano to macro. Protein materials are intriguing examples of materials that balance multiple tasks, representing some of the most sustainable material solutions that integrate structure and function. Here we review progress in understanding the deformation and fracture mechanisms of hierarchical protein materials by using a materials science approach to develop structure-process-property relations, an effort defined as materiomics. Deformation processes begin with an erratic motion of individual atoms around flaws or defects that quickly evolve into formation of macroscopic fractures as chemical bonds rupture rapidly, eventually compromising the integrity of the structure or the biological system leading to failure. The combination of large-scale atomistic simulation, multi-scale modeling methods, theoretical analyses combined with experimental validation provides a powerful approach in studying deformation and failure phenomena in protein materials. Here we review studies focused on the molecular origin of deformation and fracture processes of three types of protein materials. The review includes studies of collagen – Nature’s super-glue; beta-sheet rich protein structures as found in spider silk – a natural fiber that can reach the strength of a steel cable; as well as intermediate filaments – a class of alpha-helix based structural proteins responsible for the mechanical integrity of eukaryotic cells. The article concludes with a discussion of the significance of universally found structural patterns such as the staggered collagen fibril architecture or the alpha-helical protein motif.}

abstract = {Developmental and individual differences in the tendency to favor analytic responses over heuristic responses were examined in children of two different ages (10- and 11-year-olds versus 13-year-olds), and of widely varying cognitive ability. Three tasks were examined that all required analytic processing to override heuristic processing: inductive reasoning, deductive reasoning under conditions of belief bias, and probabilistic reasoning. Significant increases in analytic responding with development were observed on the first two tasks. Cognitive ability was associated with analytic responding on all three tasks. Cognitive style measures such as actively open-minded thinking and need for cognition explained variance in analytic responding on the tasks after variance shared with cognitive ability had been controlled. The implications for dual-process theories of cognition and cognitive development are discussed.}

abstract = {Today, engineers rely on conventional iterative (often manual) techniques for conceptual design. Emerging parametric models facilitate design space exploration based on quantifiable performance metrics, yet remain time-consuming and computationally expensive, leaving room for improvement. This paper provides a design exploration and explanation framework to augment the designer via a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which serves as a forward performance predictor as well as an inverse design generator conditioned on a set of performance requests. Hence, the CVAE overcomes the limitations of traditional iterative techniques by learning a differentiable mapping for a highly nonlinear design space, thus enabling sensitivity analysis. These methods allow for informing designers about (i) relations of the model between features and performances and (ii) structural improvements under user-defined objectives. The framework is tested on a case-study and proves its potential to serve as a future co-pilot for conceptual design studies of diverse civil structures and beyond.}

abstract = {Clustering, as an unsupervised data mining technique, allows us to classify similar objects into the same cluster according to certain criteria. It helps us identify patterns between objects, reveal the associations between objects, and discover hidden structures. Traditional two-way clustering (2W clustering) algorithms represent one cluster by one set and only two types of relationships are considered between a sample and a cluster, namely, belonging to and not belonging to. Two-way decision is not always feasible especially in situations that are characterized by uncertainty and lack of information. Guided by the principle of three-way decision (3WD) as thinking in threes, three-way clustering (3W clustering) addresses the information uncertainty problem using core and the fringe regions to character a cluster. The universe is split into three sections by these two sets, which capture three kinds of relationships between objects and a cluster, namely, belonging to, partially belonging to, and not belonging-to. Compared with 2W clustering methods, 3W clustering incorporates the fringe region to describe the uncertain relationship between objects and clusters, which provides more information about the clustering structure. This survey points out the historical developments of three-way clustering and makes an overview of the achievements in the field of three-way clustering. In addition, to reap a clearer grasp of the development and research significance of three-way clustering, we divide the existing three-way clustering approaches into two categories and present the bibliometric analysis of related approaches. Finally, we point out some challenges and future research topics in three-way clustering. It is hoped that this review can serve as a reference and provide convenience for scholars and practitioners in the field of three-way clustering.}

Works of renowned authors, as well as some of their main commentators, were addressed to report the development of enactive approach. We indicate that the enactive approach transcends its original context within biology, and at a second moment within connectionism, changes the understanding of the relationships so far established between the body and the environment, and the ideas of conceptual relationships between the mind and the body. The influence on computational theories is of great importance, leading to new artificial intelligence systems as well as the proposition of complex, autopoietic and alive machines. Finally, the article stresses the importance of the enactive approach in the design of agents, understanding that previous approaches have very different cognitive architectures and that a prototypical model of enactive cognitive architecture is one of the largest challenges today.}

abstract = {Counting of mitotic figures is a fundamental step in grading and prognostication of several cancers. However, manual mitosis counting is tedious and time-consuming. In addition, variation in the appearance of mitotic figures causes a high degree of discordance among pathologists. With advances in deep learning models, several automatic mitosis detection algorithms have been proposed but they are sensitive to domain shift often seen in histology images. We propose a robust and efficient two-stage mitosis detection framework, which comprises mitosis candidate segmentation (Detecting Fast) and candidate refinement (Detecting Slow) stages. The proposed candidate segmentation model, termed EUNet, is fast and accurate due to its architectural design. EUNet can precisely segment candidates at a lower resolution to considerably speed up candidate detection. Candidates are then refined using a deeper classifier network, EfficientNet-B7, in the second stage. We make sure both stages are robust against domain shift by incorporating domain generalization methods. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and generalizability of the proposed model on the three largest publicly available mitosis datasets, winning the two mitosis domain generalization challenge contests (MIDOG21 and MIDOG22). Finally, we showcase the utility of the proposed algorithm by processing the TCGA breast cancer cohort (1,124 whole-slide images) to generate and release a repository of more than 620K potential mitotic figures (not exhaustively validated).}

(1) The preverbal counting mechanisms is the source of the implicit principles that guide the acquisition of verbal counting. (2) The preverbal system of arithmetic computation provides the framework for the assimilation of the verbal system. (3) Learning to count involves, in part, learning a mapping from the preverbal numerical magnitudes to the verbal and written number symbols and the inverse mappings from these symbols to the preverbal magnitudes. (4) Subitizings is the use of the preverbal counting process and the mapping from the resulting magnitudes to number words in order to generate rapidly the number words for small numerosities. (5) The retrieval of the number facts, which plays a central role in verbal computation, is mediated via the inverse mappings from verbal and written numbers to the preverbal magnitudes and the use of these magnitudes to find the appropriate cells in tabular arrangements of the answers. (6) This model of the fact retrieval process accounts for the salient features of the reaction time differences and error patterns revealed by expriments on mental arithmetic. (7) The application of verbal and written computational algorithms goes on in parallel with, and is to some extent guided by, preverbal computations, both in the child and in the adult.}

While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising solutions to address climate change impacts, it also raises many application limitations and challenges. A risk governance perspective is used to analyze the role of AI in supporting decision-making for climate adaptation, spanning risk assessment, policy analysis, and implementation. This comprehensive review combines expert insights and systematic literature review. The study’s findings indicate a large emphasis on applying AI to climate “risk assessments,” particularly regarding hazard and exposure assessment, but a lack of innovative approaches and tools to evaluate resilience and vulnerability as well as prioritization and implementation process, all of which involve subjective, qualitative, and context-specific elements. Additionally, the study points out challenges such as difficulty of simulating complex long-term changes, and evolving policies and human behavior, reliance on data quality and computational resources, and the need for improved interpretability of results as areas requiring further development.}

As in the literature experiments, students were in their normal school environment following their regular curriculum and were unaware that their learning was being observed. Guided Cognition design was found to be effective for learning mathematics. Working story problems that were enriched with cognitive events such as role play, divergent thinking, visualizing and illustrating, and relating to prior experience raised scores on unexpected quizzes by about a letter grade. Another unexpected quiz found that the improvements in problem-solving performance persisted for 6months. Guided Cognition homework was also found to be efficient in that students who worked eight problems and then performed four cognitive events performed as well on unexpected quizzes as students who worked 24 problems in the same time interval. Another pair of experiments determined that modest gains could be made from merely reading completed examples of cognitive events, but that these gains were not long-lasting. Performing the cognitive events was found to be most effective for long-term performance. Another experiment found that experiencing cognitive events after working some mathematics problems can help consolidate knowledge of how to work such problems.}

Geographic information systems (GIS) are well established, but the use of GIS technology within finance and trade analysis is still in its infancy. In this article, we highlighted the potential of GIS technology and big data analytics and demonstrated the importance of thinking in spatial terms for analysing patterns within the trade and finance industries. We studied spatiotemporal trade and shopping patterns in the city of Tabriz using data generated by customer purchase transactions obtained from 5200 stores, shopping, business and service centres. We employed time series transaction data collected from the points of sale in stores, shopping, service and business centres located in different areas of the city. We applied four well known geospatial big data driven approaches including machine learning nearest neighbour, kernel density estimation, space–time pattern mining and spatiotemporal coupling tele-coupling for detecting and mapping of spatial trade hotspot patterns. The results of this study indicated the potential of GIScience methods for the explicit spatial mapping of trade and shopping patterns. The results revealed that the city centre, particularly the Bazaar of Tabriz, acts as the city’s heart of trade, and we identify additional major business hotspots. Furthermore, the results allow for studying the impacts of unbalanced urban development in Tabriz, where the wealthy suburbs with high quality of life, such as Valiasr and Elguli, host the major shopping hotspots. The spatial patterns obtained enable local stakeholders, decision makers and authorities to develop strategic plans for urban sustainable development in Tabriz. The geospatial big data approach used can stimulate novel and progressive research. Results of this study demonstrate methodological advancements in GIScience by ’spatializing’ individual purchase data and therefor proposing an explicit geospatial big data analysis approach.}

abstract = {Background
Machine learning (ML) efficiently processes large datasets, showing promise in enhancing clinical practice within physical therapy.
Objective
The aim of this scoping review is to provide an overview of studies using ML approaches in clinical settings of physical therapy.
Data sources
A scoping review was performed in PubMed, EMBASE, PEDro, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Scopus.
Selection criteria
We included studies utilizing ML methods. ML was defined as the utilization of computational systems to encode patterns and relationships, enabling predictions or classifications with minimal human interference.
Data extraction and data synthesis
Data were extracted regarding methods, data types, performance metrics, and model availability.
Results
Forty-two studies were included. The majority were published after 2020 (n = 25). Fourteen studies (33.3%) were in the musculoskeletal physical therapy field, nine (21.4%) in neurological, and eight (19%) in sports physical therapy. We identified 44 different ML models, with random forest being the most used. Three studies reported on model availability. We identified several clinical applications for ML-based tools, including diagnosis (n = 14), prognosis (n = 7), treatment outcomes prediction (n = 7), clinical decision support (n = 5), movement analysis (n = 4), patient monitoring (n = 3), and personalized care plan (n = 2).
Limitation
Model performance metrics, costs, model interpretability, and explainability were not reported.
Conclusion
This scope review mapped the emerging landscape of machine learning applications in physical therapy. Despite the growing interest, the field still lacks high-quality studies on validation, model availability, and acceptability to advance from research to clinical practice.}

abstract = {Maintaining the sustainability of online support groups (OSGs) presents a significant challenge. Integrating the literature on interaction dynamics and supportive communication, this study investigated how interaction dynamics in supportive communication foster long-term support-seeking behaviors that are crucial to sustaining continuous support exchanges in OSGs. Using a large-scale dataset of 48,868 posts and 468,243 comments over ten years from an OSG, this study examined how reciprocity and compensation of emotional and informational support, signaled by emotional expressions and analytical expressions, predicted a poster's future support-seeking behaviors in the OSG. Results showed that a poster's future support-seeking behaviors were positively associated with receiving (a) reciprocity of analytical expressions and (b) compensation of negative emotional expressions with positive emotional expressions in their past posts. However, reciprocity of negative emotional expressions was negatively associated with a poster's future support-seeking behaviors. This study emphasizes social support as an ongoing interactive process and its importance in motivating support-seeking behaviors and fostering a thriving OSG.}

abstract = {In this study, a modified version of Hankel Interaction Index Array (HIIA) for control configuration selection is presented which can overcome some of its shortcomings, like e.g. scaling dependency, or not relating to closed loop system properties. Inspired by the relative gain array approach, the HIIA is reformulated in the relative gain thinking by considering the effect of closing loops. The ratio of the Hankel norm of the subsystems in closed and open loop are used to state a modified version of HIIA, which has improved characteristics compared to the original HIIA. Properties of the modified HIIA are discussed and benchmarked with established methods on three example cases.}

abstract = {Innovative methods in data collection and analytics for pest and disease management are advancing together with computational efficiency. Tools, such as the open-data kit, research electronic data capture, fall armyworm monitoring, and early warning- system application and remote sensing have aided the efficiency of all types of data collection, including text, location, images, audio, video, and others. Concurrently, data analytics have also evolved with the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning (ML) for early warning and decision-support systems. ML has repeatedly been used for the detection, diagnosis, modeling, and prediction of crop pests and diseases. This paper thus highlights the innovations, implications, and future progression of these technologies for sustainability.}

abstract = {The main purpose of mathematics teaching is to enable students to solve problems in daily life. Unfortunately, according to the latest national test results, most students lack mathematical problem solving skills. This proves to be one of the reasons why overall achievement in mathematics is considered quite low. It also reflects that students have difficulties in comprehending mathematical problems affecting the process of problem-solving. Therefore, in order to allow teachers to establish a proper teaching plan suitable for students’ learning process, this research aims to analyze the difficulties in mathematical problem solving among elementary school students. Samples are divided into two groups, elementary school students and mathematics teachers. Data collection was conducted by structured interview, documentary analysis, and survey tests. Data analysis was conducted by descriptive statistics, and content analysis. The results suggest that there are several difficulties in problem solving, namely 1) Students have difficulties in understanding the keywords appearing in problems, thus cannot interpret them in mathematical sentences. 2) Students are unable to figure out what to assume and what information from the problem is necessary to solving it, 3) Whenever students do not understand the problem, they tend to guess the answer without any thinking process, 4) Students are impatient and do not like to read mathematical problems, and 5) Students do not like to read long problems. Therefore, the results found in this research will lead to the creation and the development of mathematical problem solving diagnostic tests for teachers, in order to improve students’ mathematical problem solving skills.}

abstract = {In this paper, we trace the rise of heterogeneous household models in mainstream macroeconomics from the turn of the 1980s to the early 2000s, when these models evolved into an identifiable and consistent literature. We show that different communities across the US and Europe considered heterogeneous agents for various reasons and developed models that differed in their theoretical and empirical strategies. Minnesota economists primarily focused on incorporating stochastic heterogeneity into general equilibrium models. Other researchers refined growth models or tried to find alternatives to the permanent income hypothesis, leading them to explore more structural heterogeneity. We also document the computational challenges that some of these communities faced, how they gradually became aware of each other's work, and how they faced criticisms from macro- and microeconomists, many of them trained in European countries and dissatisfied with the theoretical and empirical aggregation strategies underlying these models.}

abstract = {Development of design-by-analogy tools is a promising design innovation research avenue. Previously, a method for computationally structuring patent databases as a basis for an automated design-by-analogy tool was introduced. To demonstrate its strengths and weaknesses, a computationally-generated structure is compared to four expert designers' mental models of the domain. Results indicate that, compared to experts, the computationally-generated structure is sensible in clustering of patents and organization of clusters. The computationally-generated structure represents a space in which experts can find common ground/consensus – making it promising to be intuitive/accessible to broad cohorts of designers. The computational method offers a resource-efficient way of usefully conceptualizing the space that is sensible to expert designers, while maintaining an element of unexpected representation of the space.}

This paper unravels the transformative power of technologies on: the tourism actors and resources (both the traditional but also new actors, i.e. the technology agents); the ways actors interact to (co-)create but also (co-)destruct tourism value; and the context in which tourism actors interact from a linear supply chain tourism ‘industry’ to a complex socio-technical smart tourism ecosystem. To study such complex phenomena and transformations, the paper emphasises that research should not only adopt a multi-disciplinary approach, but it also needs to follow an anti-disciplinary thinking whereby new knowledge and constructs do not simply fall within existing paradigms, disciplinary silos and mindsets once developed by studying the ‘pure’ humans and their behaviours.}

abstract = {A subfield of computing known as “neuromorphic computing” (NC) develops cutting-edge and effective computing platforms by drawing inspiration from the anatomy and physiology of the human brain. The potential for energy savings offered by NC is one of its primary benefits. Neuromorphic systems aim to replicate the brain's remarkable energy efficiency by utilizing specialized hardware designs and algorithms that optimize computation and minimize data movement to reduce power consumption. This work presents a thorough investigation of the development and goals of neuromorphic frameworks, taking motivation from the complicated functions of the human mind. It investigates the motives and driving forces behind the pursuit of NC, such as the search for highly parallel and energy-efficient computing architectures. In addition, this work has discussed the thematic areas and benchmarks for progress in NC as well. This chapter serves as a guide through the neuroinspired journey of neuromorphic systems, revealing insight into their past, present, and future.}
