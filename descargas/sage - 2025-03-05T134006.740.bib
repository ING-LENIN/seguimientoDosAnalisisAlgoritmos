N2 - The ability to conduct reasoned argument (to support opinions with non-spurious evidence, to anticipate what evidence would support alternative opinions, to weigh the quality of competing items of evidence, and so on) is a key component of critical thinking. Kuhn (1991) suggested that practice might help improve thinking skills, and in particular that peer-based practice would be effective in improving such skills. Three studies that attempted to use peer interaction to help enhance students’ argumentative reasoning skills are briefly reviewed. Some evidence is provided that supports Kuhn’s advocacy of peer-based practice; however, some of the studies have supplemented the peer-based element of the situation with a more traditional, instruction-based teaching component. Nevertheless, it is concluded that peer interaction is a potentially useful method for helping inculcate thinking skills.

N2 - The concept of water quality has often generally revolved around the all-round safety of water for human consumption. The quality of much of the 3% of the earth’s humanly consumable water classed as freshwater is under threat of climate change, rising population numbers, indiscriminate land usage, detrimental agricultural practices and contamination from poor waste management. The need for optimal water quality enhancement has become more germane to sustainable socio-economic development. This paper examines the evolution of efforts made by the scientific community over the years to ensure water quality can be characterized and properly managed to ensure the global ever-growing demand for clean water for human consumption is continually met. The development of state-of-the-art computational decision support systems (DSS) should play a vital role. However, efforts in this regard are currently bedevilled by major challenges such as quantifying, measuring, processing and controlling the numerous metrics of water quality, as well as their adaptation and integration into a fully developed universal water quality model. In addressing these challenges, a shift towards simpler modelling approaches and the integration of uni-purpose models which can be cascaded into decision-making systems is being popularly proposed. However, with technological advancements already stimulating a water quality management revolution, there is a shift in paradigm to more universal modelling attempts with great optimism towards overcoming the challenges of developing universal water quality models and DSS. The prospects and opportunities of a water quality management renaissance offered by radical scientific innovations look promising, as the world races with time to provide support systems that can help deal better with the dynamics of sustainable water supply in increasingly contaminable environments and progressively unpredictable climates.

N2 - A census of Accrediting Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications (ACEJMC)–accredited journalism programs reveals that less than a quarter require students to learn code. Despite industry desires for journalists with coding skills, nearly 40% of the units offer no coding classes. Among programs that require code, most rely on a course or courses taught by full-time faculty in the accredited unit. About one third of units that do not require code currently have plans to add it in the future.

N2 - Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has been shown to be an effective technology for reducing the airborne bioburden in indoor environments and is already advocated as a potential infection control measure for healthcare settings. However, much of the understanding of UVGI performance is based on experimental studies or numerical simulation in mechanically ventilated environments. This study considers the application of an upper-room UVGI system in a naturally ventilated multi-bed hospital ward. A computational fluid dynamics model is used to simulate a Nightingale-type hospital ward with wind-driven cross-ventilation and three wall-mounted UVGI fixtures. A parametric study considering 50 different fixture configurations and three ventilation rates was carried out using a design of experiments approach. Each configuration was assessed by calculating the UV dose distribution over the ward and at each bed. Results show that dose is influenced by the location of the fixtures and the ventilation regime. Thermal effects are likely to be important at low ventilation rates and may reduce UV effectiveness. A metamodel-based numerical optimisation was applied at a ventilation rate of 6 air changes per hour. In this case, the optimum result is achieved when UVGI fixtures are mounted on the leeward wall at their lowest mounting height.

N2 - General value functions (GVFs) in the reinforcement learning (RL) literature are long-term predictive summaries of the outcomes of agents following specific policies in the environment. Affordances as perceived action possibilities with specific valence may be cast into predicted policy-relative goodness and modeled as GVFs. A systematic explication of this connection shows that GVFs and especially their deep-learning embodiments (1) realize affordance prediction as a form of direct perception, (2) illuminate the fundamental connection between action and perception in affordance, and (3) offer a scalable way to learn affordances using RL methods. Through an extensive review of existing literature on GVF applications and representative affordance research in robotics, we demonstrate that GVFs provide the right framework for learning affordances in real-world applications. In addition, we highlight a few new avenues of research opened up by the perspective of “affordance as GVF,” including using GVFs for orchestrating complex behaviors.

N2 - This paper describes the implementation of the initial strain energy-based thermo-elastoviscoplastic two-parameter damage self-healing models for bituminous materials to compare the model predictions with experimental measurements. Computational algorithms based on the two-step operator splitting methodology are proposed and employed for numerical results. The elastic two-parameter damage self-healing predictor and the viscoplastic corrector are coupled with the Arrhenius-type temperature term via the net stress concept in conjunction with the hypothesis of strain equivalence and then systematically used for numerical implementation of the models. Four numerical examples of three-dimensional problems are first demonstrated for the effect of temperature and rest period for healing phenomenon. Second, experimental validation of the proposed model against monotonic constant-strain test at different temperatures and controlled-strain cyclic tension test is presented. It is observed that numerical simulations by the two-parameter model agree well with experimental results. In particular, the softening responses of the bituminous composites are well predicted for monotonic constant-strain rate test and the viscous damage behavior can be reasonably predicted by the proposed two-parameter damage models. It is noted that the two-parameter model can better predict the thermo-mechanical behavior of asphalt and is more versatile than the one-parameter isotropic damage self-healing model.

N2 - Cathodic protection (CP) is widely used to mitigate corrosion and protect the substrate. However, sacrificial anodes are often undersized or improperly positioned. This study systematically investigates how anode design factors affect the CP effectiveness through computational modelling and double-objective optimisation techniques around the optimum location and dimension of anodes. State-of-the-art algorithms including the Monte-Carlo, Nelder–Mead, co-ordinate search, constrained optimisation by linear approximation (COBYLA) and bound optimisation by quadratic approximation (BOBYQA) are employed to optimise anode locations and genetic algorithm is utilised for optimising anode dimension and the objective is maximising the current output and minimising the cost. In the current study, the BOBYQA technique proved efficient in reaching the optimal response at the appropriate time. The findings indicate that in double-objective (cost and potential) optimisation of 14.5 kg anode, minimising anode radius (from 6.5 cm to 5.4 cm) and optimising the position boosts the current output by up to 15.5%. Refined anode geometries increase the average structure potentials (806 → 822 mV) by over 15 mV, translating to extended service lifetimes. In the comparison of single (cost) and double (cost and potential)-objective optimisation, about 15% more current reaches the structure and causes about 2% less anode mass loss for the same anode dimensions. Also, the results show the 7.7 kg anode performs better than the 14.5 kg anode and so output current and the percentage of current that reaches the structure of the 7.7 kg and 14.5 kg are 0.66 A and 0.46 A and 66% and 60%, respectively.

N2 - Urban building energy modelling (UBEM) is a prevalent research method to examine the multi-scale building to urban renovation in mitigating global energy-related carbon emissions. However, only a few studies delineate a complete workflow from generation to application using UBEM. In particular, to facilitate the designing of sustainable built environments, existing research needs to emphasize the integration of multi-scale energy performance evaluation within the design development process for architects and urban planners. The key challenges lie in the need for integrated datasets and incompatibility between software tools required for designing, modelling, and evaluation. This paper presents a comprehensive methodological framework to investigate applicable urban decarbonization strategies. A case study of Sheffield in the UK demonstrates the development of an automated and standardized computational workflow. This data-driven workflow aims to evaluate energy demand and supply scenarios at an urban scale to access the potential of decarbonizing built environments. The workflow is designed to be adaptable to various scales of urban regions, given a suitable geographic information system (GIS) dataset.

N2 - The shape of dose response of ionizing radiation (IR) induced cancer at low dose region, either linear non-threshold or J-shaped, has been a debate for a long time. This dose response relationship can be influenced by built-in capabilities of cells that minimize the fixation of IR-mediated DNA damage as pro-carcinogenic mutations. Key capabilities include sensing of damage, activation of cell cycle checkpoint arrests that provide time needed for repair of the damage as well as apoptosis. Here we describe computational modeling of the signaling pathways that link sensing of DNA damage and checkpoint arrest activation/apoptosis to investigate how these molecular-level interactions influence the dose response relationship for IR induced cancer. The model provides qualitatively accurate descriptions of the IR-mediated activation of cell cycle checkpoints and the apoptotic pathway, and of time-course activities and dose response of relevant regulatory proteins (e.g. p53 and p21). Linking to a two-stage clonal growth cancer model, the model described here successfully captured a monotonically increasing to a J-shaped dose response curve and identified one potential mechanism leading to the J-shape: the cell cycle checkpoint arrest time saturates with the increase of the dose.
