abstract = {Considering (1) overinclusion to be related to symptoms of paranoia, delusions, thought-disorder, and ideas of reference, and (2) retardation of speed to be related to depression and slowness, scores for 66 patients were examined on 11 tests of these dimensions. Thirty-eight variables in rotated principal components gave these factors: (a) overinclusion, (b) poor concept formation, and (c) conceptual retardation. The overinclusion hypothesis was confirmed except for ideas of reference. Overinclusion and retardation defined as symptom entities provided better differentiation on factor scores than did the diagnoses of schizophrenia and depression. It was proposed that generalization and mental speed have a curvilinear relationship in which the extremes are directly related to symptoms of disordered thinking and depression.}

abstract = {This study tested the hypothesis that individual differences in generalized control perception for 43 undergraduate adults may be reflected in Spontaneous Eye Blink Rates during conversation in an interview. Control perception was assessed by means of Rotter’s internal-external Locus of Control questionnaires, while Spontaneous Eye Blink Rates were computed from filmed videos of interviews consisting of a series of questions which could presumably have triggered different mental states. Pearson correlations and linear regression analyses indicated that the individual differences in Spontaneous Eye Blink Rates did not differ significantly across different questions, but that Spontaneous Eye Blink Rates measured over the entire interview correlated positively and significantly with an internal Locus of Control (r = .26). This could be interpreted as modest but corroborative evidence that a personality trait reflecting control perception may have a biological component. The possible roles of dopamine neurotransmission and frontal cortex involvement in higher cognition and Locus of Control are discussed.}

abstract = {Group hole nozzles (GHN) are injector tips with clusters of small holes used in place of a single large hole. In this work, GHN with two holes per cluster and a diverging angle of 15° between the holes were studied using experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and comparisons were made with conventional diesel injectors. First, experiments were performed in a high temperature pressure vessel (HTPV) to understand the free spray behavior. HTPV experiments revealed that the diverging GHN had slower penetration with a more dispersed spray and a shorter lift-off length relative to the conventional injector. The GHN also exhibited higher natural luminosity compared to the conventional injector, which is indicative of increased soot formation with the GHN. CFD model validated with HTPV experimental data was used to study the sensitivity to the angle between the holes and the hole count per cluster. Results showed that soot formation increased as the divergence angle increased from 0° to 15°. Furthermore, as the divergence angle increased, increasing the hole count per cluster increased the soot formation significantly. Following the HTPV study, the injectors were tested on a single-cylinder heavy-duty diesel engine at a high-load operating condition. Results showed that the diverging GHN injector produced a lower mixing-controlled combustion rate compared to the conventional injector. The slower burn rates resulted in lower NOx and higher soot emissions for the diverging GHN injector. CFD simulations of the engine experiments predicted the slower burn rate seen with the diverging GHN injector. In-cylinder visualization of the CFD results showed that slower penetration with the diverging GHN results in reduced mixing upon surface interaction, and an inability to utilize the fresh air in the outer regions of the combustion chamber which resulted in richer local equivalence ratios and higher soot emissions compared to the conventional injector.}

abstract = {Peripheral artery stenting (PAS) is an effective alternative for peripheral endarterectomy. Smart stents can be used to minimize the problems of interaction between peripheral arteries and smart stent. To evaluate the biomechanical properties of smart stents and their interactions with the peripheral artery, a 3D nonlinear finite element method (FEM) model that was composed of a peripheral artery and a smart stent was built. The present simulation modeled smart superelasticity material based on thermodynamics of the Helmholtz free energy (Auricchio theory) and Peripheral artery based on hyperelastic models (Mooney-Rivlin and Ogden). Additionally, the present study used FEM to assess the influences of the material properties, strain level, and friction coefficient (with attention to smart stent’s materials properties) of the newly designed smart stent during crimping and its interaction with the peripheral artery. The results showed that the smart stent with high Af: Austenite finish temperature, 90% crimping, and friction coefficient of 0.1 between smart stent and peripheral artery performed better mechanically and clinically, which can be attributed to suitable Chronic Outward Force (COF), high Radial Resistive Force (RRF), whole mechanical hysteresis regarding superelastic performance, the high martensite formation, the low stress on the peripheral artery, and the high strain on the internal curvature of the smart stent and peripheral artery. Moreover, it was found that the Mooney-Rivlin model showed a better mechanical performance that the Ogden model given the distribution of stress and strain level on the peripheral artery. These models were appropriate for the description of the peripheral artery performance and smart stent behavior with considering material properties, strain level, and friction coefficient during the interaction process.}
