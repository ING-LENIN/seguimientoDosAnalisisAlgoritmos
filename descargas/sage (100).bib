abstract = {Simulation of blood flow in a stenosed artery using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) is a new research field, which is a particle-based method and different from the traditional continuum modelling technique such as Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Both techniques harness parallel computing to process hemodynamics of cardiovascular structures. The objective of this study is to develop and test a new robust method for comparison of arterial flow velocity contours by SPH with the well-established CFD technique, and the implementation of SPH in computed tomography (CT) reconstructed arteries. The new method was developed based on three-dimensional (3D) straight and curved arterial models of millimeter range with a 25% stenosis in the middle section. In this study, we employed 1,000 to 13,000 particles to study how the number of particles influences SPH versus CFD deviation for blood-flow velocity distribution. Because further increasing the particle density has a diminishing effect on this deviation, we have determined a critical particle density of 1.45 particles/mm2 based on Reynolds number (Re = 200) at the inlet for an arterial flow simulation. Using this critical value of particle density can avoid unnecessarily big computational expenses that have no further effect on simulation accuracy. We have particularly shown that the SPH method has a big potential to be used in the virtual surgery system, such as to simulate the interaction between blood flow and the CT reconstructed vessels, especially those with stenosis or plaque when encountering vasculopathy, and for employing the simulation results output in clinical surgical procedures.}

abstract = {This work concentrates on the characterization of the stress intensity factor range for a compact tension specimen tested under a uniaxial tensile fatigue loading condition. The experimental solution is obtained using a three-dimensional full-field optical technique, digital image correlation. The deformation field is measured and documented for distinct crack lengths. As a relevant fracture parameter, stress intensity factor is thus experimentally measured combined with a computational overdeterministic algorithm for different crack lengths. Moreover, to verify the performance of the proposed fracture model, the cracked compact tension specimen is elasto-statically resolved using advanced discretization techniques, such as the finite element method, the meshless radial point interpolation method and the meshless natural neighbour radial point interpolation method. The finite element method model is thereby analysed with ABAQUS© to enable computation of mode I stress intensity factor results based on strain energy release rate criterion for different crack measurements in addition to strain contours. Likewise, the resolution pattern is repeated for meshless methods, and analogous numerical solutions are thus obtained. Overall, the experimental and numerical stress intensity factor results are compared with an available solution (ASTM E647) exhibiting a reasonable agreement. The novelty of this investigation is the amalgamation of an experimental digital image correlation procedure with a computational overdeterministic algorithm and, most importantly, the meshless formulation performance in the linear elastic fracture mechanics.}

abstract = {This paper explores strategies for building toolchains to design, develop and fabricate architectural designs. It explains how complex curved structures can be constructed from flat standard panels. The hypothesis of this research is that by embedding ruled based procedures addressing generative, variational, iterative, and fabricational logics into early phases of design, both design techniques and digital fabrication methods can merge to solve a recurrent problem in contemporary architectural design, building double curved structures. Furthermore it achieves this using common fabrication methods and standard construction materials. It describes the processes of programming computational tools creating and developing designs to fabricate continuous complex curved structures. I describe this through a series of experiments, using parametric design environments and scripted functions, implementing certain techniques to fabricate these designs using rapid prototyping machines. Comparing different design and fabrication approaches I offer a discussion about universal application of programmed procedures into architectural design.}

The computational models described use techniques from Logic Programming, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Biomathematics. They address problems in the development, growth, and repair of oral and craniofacial tissues arising in cell biology, clinical genetics, and dentistry. At the micro-level, the dynamic interaction of cells in the oral epithelium is modeled. At the macro-level, models are constructed of either the craniofacial shape of an individual or the craniofacial shape differences within and between healthy and congenitally abnormal populations. In between, in terms of scale, there are models of normal dentition and the use of computerized expert knowledge to guide the design of dental prostheses used to restore function in partially edentulous patients.}

abstract = {Social media has become a powerful conduit for misinformation during major public events. As a result, an extant body of research has emerged on misinformation and its diffusion. However, the research is fragmented and has mainly focused on understanding the content of misinformation messages. Little attention is paid to the production and consumption of misinformation. This study presents the results of a detailed comparative analysis of the production, consumption, and diffusion of misinformation with authentic information. Our findings, based on extensive use of computational linguistic analyses of COVID-19 pandemic-related messages on the Twitter platform, revealed that misinformation and authentic information exhibit very different characteristics in terms of their contents, production, diffusion, and their ultimate consumption. To support our study, we carefully selected a sample of 500 widely propagated messages confirmed by fact-checking websites as misinformation or authentic information about pandemic-related topics from the Twitter platform. Detailed computational linguistic analyses were performed on these messages and their replies (N = 198,750). Additionally, we analyzed approximately 1.2 million Twitter user accounts responsible for producing, forwarding, or replying to these messages. Our extensive and detailed findings were used to develop and propose a theoretical framework for understanding the diffusion of misinformation on social media. Our study offers insights for social media platforms, researchers, policymakers, and online information consumers about how misinformation spreads over social media platforms.}

abstract = {Military missions are increasingly contingent upon the ‘emergent qualities’ of distributed cognition. Cognition is situated and shared across multiple agents, objects, and environments. The total information surround is evolutionary, chaotic, and presents workers with ill-defined dilemmas that proliferate across geopolitical boundaries under stressed conditions. Crew members are bombarded with multiple constraints as they encounter automation, situational awareness, and information warfare. To address these concerns the use of computational neuroscience/ubiquitous computing technologies are described. Ubiquitous computing means that computing elements are not integrated in a single workstation but are ubiquitous; they are distributed as everyday objects in an operative work environment. When complemented with evolutionary computing technology, computer structures (cellular thoughtonoma) are designed to ‘genetically evolve’ through natural selection to be ‘fit’ with environmental, technological, and worker demands. This paper discusses the symbiosis underlying thoughtonomous technologies and describes possibilities to radically redefine intelligent interaction and collaboration.}

abstract = {Design modification is a main step in developing machines and artificial organ. A new dialysis apparatus air chamber detects clot formation and interruption of blood refining circuit. Due to using enough anticoagulant, thrombosis may occur because of vortex formed by turbulent flow. Turbulent blood flow causes to endothelial injury thus supporting the formation of a thrombus. Computational fluid dynamics can estimate the flow velocity and turbulence distribution and it can be used as applicable tool to design diagnosis and modifying. In this paper CFD simulation used to find the high turbulent intensity region within the chamber and an optimization method is adopted based on the geometry changing and trying the simulation results. The turbulent intensity is chosen as a criterion to achieving to an optimized condition. Finally, a best geometry is derived for the chamber entrance by this process and modified prototype is manufactured. This refined chamber maintains on the dialysis machine and tested for several patients with different blood characteristics. The results show that no more clot formation has been observed in this new designed chamber.}
