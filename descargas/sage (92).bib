abstract = {To fully study the relationship between the internal flow field and hemolysis index in an axial flow blood pump, a computational fluid dynamics–discrete element method coupled calculation method was used. Through numerical analysis under conditions of 6000, 8000, and 10,000 r/min, it was found that there was flow separation of blood cell particles in the tip of the impeller and the guide vane behind the impeller. The flow field has a larger pressure gradient distribution, which reduces the lift ratio of the blood pump and easily causes blood cell damage. The study shows that the hemolysis index obtained by the computational fluid dynamics—discrete element method is 4.75% higher than that from the traditional computational fluid dynamics method, which indicates the impact of microcollision between erythrocyte particles and walls on hemolysis index and also further verifies the validity of the computational fluid dynamics–discrete element coupling method. Through the hydraulic and particle image velocimetry experiments of the blood pump, the coincidence between numerical calculation and experiment is analyzed from macro and micro aspects, which shows that the numerical calculation method is feasible.}

abstract = {The study presents unique teaching approach for generating a parametric modular facade fabrication for first-year students in visual design module using a computational visual coding method based on Truchet Tiles. The method followed four main phases: exploring tiling, testing connectivity, fabrication, and assembly. Shape grammar was considered during the design principles implementation to respond to climatic behavior. Space-filling shapes method known as the “Generalized Abeille Tiles” was followed to ensure tiling connectivity. The experimentation involves manual folding techniques without any software. A survey was conducted among first-year and fourth-year students post-introduction to computational software. The results showed a wide range of alternative geometries with different self-shading patterns generated. It highlighted that facade fabrication aided students in comprehending computational logic, easing the understanding of computational software complexity. This pilot study emphasizes the effectiveness of teaching computational concepts in early curricula.}

abstract = {Objective: Extensive research has focused on the evaluation of rupture risks in abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs) through comprehensive morphologic and hemodynamic analyses, primarily considering the AAA as a whole entity. This study tried to identify the high-risk rupture sites of AAAs more precisely before the fatal process based on morphologic and hemodynamic analyses at the local segment. Methods: Computed tomography angiography of a specific AAA patient was conducted at the follow-up 4 months before rupture, 1 day before rupture, the day of the rupture, and 15 days after endovascular aortic repair. The evolution of local morphology and the hemodynamic characteristics at these critical timepoints were investigated based on patient-specific reconstructions and computational fluid dynamics. Results: The morphologic and hemodynamic parameters of the rupture region vary continuously in the process of AAA development and rupture. The surface area and volume of the rupture segment were gradually enlarged at the follow-up 4 months before rupture (47.33 cm2; 67.35 mL), 1 day before rupture (57.23 cm2; 85.24 mL), and on the day of the rupture (62.41cm2; 104.73ml). A prominent decrease in time-averaged wall shear stress and velocity for the rupture segment is observed. The percentages of the lowest time-averaged wall shear stress (<0.1 Pa) area are increased in the AAA region (20.42%, 33.85%, and 53.00%, separately). Conclusions: The results based on precisely rebuilt geometries for the complete follow-ups of patient-specific computed tomography angiography demonstrate that notable morphologic and hemodynamic evolutions have occurred in the local segment of the AAA, which was further proved at the rupture site. The significant changes occurring at the local segment may provide valuable information for the evaluation of aneurysm rupture risk and locate the most probable site of rupture. Clinical Impact Capturing the entire process of AAA rupture through CTA imaging is a rare occurrence in clinical practice. The evolution of morphology and hemodynamic characteristics observed in the illustrated results provides valuable insights for clinicians to monitor the state of AAA from a different perspective. These findings suggest that variations in morphology and hemodynamics within the local segment of the AAA might serve as an alternative approach for predicting the rupture risk of AAA.}

abstract = {Abstract A computational model of the pregnant occupant, which is capable of simulating the dynamic response to acceleration impacts, is introduced. The occupant model represents a 5th percentile female at around the 38th week of pregnancy. A finite element uterus and multi-body fetus is integrated into an existing female model to incorporate pregnant female anthropometry. The complete model, ‘Expecting’, is used to simulate a range of frontal impacts of increasing severity from 15km/h to 45km/h. Three levels of occupant restraint, completely unrestrained, three-point seat belt, and three-point seat belt with an airbag, are investigated. The strains developed in the uterus because of loading from the seat belt and steering-wheel unit are presented, together with an analysis of stress distribution due to inertial loading of the fetus on the uterus. The unrestrained cases are shown to be the most dangerous to the fetus, owing to the large interaction with the vehicle steering wheel at the level of the placenta. The use of a three-point seat belt together with a driver airbag appears to offer the greatest protection to the fetus.}

Development of a computer simulated person (CSP) for indoor computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation can contribute to the improvement of design and prediction method regarding the interaction between indoor air/thermal environmental factors and human responses. In this study, a CSP integrated with a virtual airway was developed and used to estimate inhalation exposure in an indoor environment. The virtual airway is a numerical respiratory tract model for CFD simulation that reproduces detailed geometry from the nasal/oral cavity to the bronchial tubes by way of the trachea. Physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK)-CFD hybrid analysis is also integrated into the CSP. Through the coupled simulation of PBPK-CFD-CSP analysis, inhalation exposure under steady state conditions where formaldehyde was emitted from floor material was analysed and respiratory tissue doses and their distributions of inhaled contaminants are discussed quantitatively.}

abstract = {In order to assist the designer in the design process, it is necessary to develop a new intelligent computational methodology that involves the integration of design, analysis and evaluation, and optimisation. In this paper, a hybrid cross-mapping neural network model (HCMNN) is proposed to support design, analysis and evaluation, and optimisation in the design process, which integrates a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and a Hopfield neural network (HNN). The BPNN is used for representing design patterns, training classification boundaries, and outputting the net weight values to the HNN, and then the HNN uses the calculated weight values to evaluate and modify or redesign the design patterns. The developed system provides a unified computational intelligent design framework. The system has self-modifying or self-learning functions. Within the system, only one network is needed to train for accomplishing design analysis and evaluation, rectification/modification and optimisation tasks in the design process. Finally, two case studies are provided to verify the proposed model.}
