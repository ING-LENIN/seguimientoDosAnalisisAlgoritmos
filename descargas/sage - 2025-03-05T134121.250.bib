N2 - Thermoplastics hold utmost importance in the day-to-day life of modern-day society, being widely employed in water transport and storage vessels commonly made from thermoplastics such as PVC, i.e., polyvinyl chloride, and PP, i.e., polypropylene. This urge for a joining technique is applicable even with water in the vessel or the submerged case. The present investigation explores ultrasonic welding as an option to weld thermoplastics in water-submerged conditions. We have performed FEM simulations and experimental validation to prove the viability of the proposed ultrasonic welding process used in welding PVC and PP in water-submerged conditions. The discussed results demonstrate a decrease in melting and degradation of adherend material at the weld interface while welding PVC and PP in water-submerged conditions and attaining 65.78% and 107% of weld strength, unlike their open-air counterparts, respectively.

N2 - Liver cancer kills approximately 800 thousand people annually worldwide, and its most common subtype is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which usually affects people with cirrhosis. Predicting survival of patients with HCC remains an important challenge, especially because technologies needed for this scope are not available in all hospitals. In this context, machine learning applied to medical records can be a fast, low-cost tool to predict survival and detect the most predictive features from health records. In this study, we analyzed medical data of 165 patients with HCC: we employed computational intelligence to predict their survival, and to detect the most relevant clinical factors able to discriminate survived from deceased cases. Afterwards, we compared our data mining results with those obtained through statistical tests and scientific literature findings. Our analysis revealed that blood levels of alkaline-phosphatase (ALP), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and hemoglobin are the most effective prognostic factors in this dataset. We found literature supporting association of these three factors with hepatoma, even though only AFP has been used in a prognostic index. Our results suggest that ALP and hemoglobin can be candidates for future HCC prognostic indexes, and that physicians could focus on ALP, AFP, and hemoglobin when studying HCC records.

N2 - Although the literature on evaluation has theorized about the distinction between internal and external evaluation, hardly any research has compared them empirically. This article examines whether the lessons of internal evaluations differed from those of external evaluations in the case of international development aid. It analyzes internal evaluations of the Asian Development Bank for nearly 1000 sovereign interventions across 38 countries in the Asia-Pacific during 1996–2016, using computational text analysis or text mining techniques. The results show that internal evaluations focused more on micro- and meso-level characteristics, while external evaluations laid more emphasis on meso- and macro-level constructs, such as dimensions of policy and the institutional environment in the recipient country, or its level and rate of economic growth. The article concludes that internal and external evaluations can be combined to create a multilevel evaluation framework that integrates micro-, meso-, and macro-level lessons to facilitate better learning.

N2 - Abstract A theoretical and computational investigation into the electrochemical machining (ECM) process for the case of a moving stepped tool eroding an initially flat surface is presented. Five parametric variations of the basic geometry of the stepped tool machining process are possible, depending on the relative distance between the moving tool and eroded work. For each of the five cases, and based on one-dimensional theory, formulae have been developed to predict the minimum depth of working material that must initially be provided to enable a particular step size to be machined to a specified tolerance. The computer simulation of the ECM process which has been developed is based on the finite element method (FEM). The geometry of tool, electrolyte and work is simulated by means of a two-dimensional mesh of square elements. A system of macros has been developed which interact internally with an FE package to move component boundaries systematically to simulate both tool movement and surface erosion. Such boundary movements are accomplished automatically and continuously without user intervention during a simulation run. The algorithms employed to achieve characteristically different erosion rates are described. Results both from one-dimensional ECM theory and from the computer simulations of the characteristic cases are presented. Comparisons show that there is good agreement between computer predictions and theory. The differential erosion process is fundamental to all ECM processes. Complex shapes evolve because of spatial differences in erosion rates. Thus the one-dimensional results presented here for the formation of a step should provide a basis for comparisons between spatially separated regions of one-dimensional differential erosion on bodies of arbitrary shape.

N2 - There are many benefits of using argumentation-based techniques in multi-agent systems, as clearly shown in the literature. Such benefits come not only from the expressiveness that argumentation-based techniques bring to agent communication but also from the reasoning and decision-making capabilities under conditions of conflicting and uncertain information that argumentation enables for autonomous agents. When developing multi-agent applications in which argumentation will be used to improve agent communication and reasoning, argumentation schemes (reasoning patterns for argumentation) are useful in addressing the requirements of the application domain in regards to argumentation (e.g., defining the scope in which argumentation will be used by agents in that particular application). In this work, we propose an argumentation framework that takes into account the particular structure of argumentation schemes at its core. This paper formally defines such a framework and experimentally evaluates its implementation for both argumentation-based reasoning and dialogues.

N2 - Given a constant stream of perceptual stimuli, how can the underlying invariances associated with a given input be learned? One approach consists of using generic truths about the spatiotemporal structure of the physical world as constraints on the types of quantities learned. The learning methodology employed here embodies one such truth: that perceptually salient properties (such as stereo disparity) tend to vary smoothly over time. Unfortunately, the units of an artificial neural network tend to encode superficial image properties, such as individual grey-level pixel values, which vary rapidly over time. However, if the states of units are constrained to vary slowly, then the network is forced to learn a smoothly varying function of the training data. We implemented this temporal-smoothness constraint in a backpropagation network which learned stereo disparity from random-dot stereograms. Temporal smoothness was formalised with the use of regularisation theory by modifying the standard cost function minimised during training of a network. Temporal smoothness was found to be similar to other techniques for improving generalisation, such as early stopping and weight decay. However, in contrast to these, the theoretical underpinnings of temporal smoothing are intimately related to fundamental characteristics of the physical world. Results are discussed in terms of regularisation theory and the physically realistic assumptions upon which temporal smoothing is based.

N2 - Purpose Investigation of pigment epithelial detachment (PED) characteristics in central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR) is underrepresented in the literature. We present a novel computational approach to quantify PED composition indices (PEDCI) in CSCR and track changes over time. Methods 34 eyes with active CSCR were analyzed quarterly over a 1-year period. Cases were categorized into acute and chronic CSCR depending on a symptom duration of less than 3 months or more than 3 months respectively. PED, retinal and choroidal dimensions were manually measured, and interval changes were compared using repeated measures of variance ANOVA. PED composition analysis involved manual segmentation followed by automated sub segmentation of PED areas to identify serous, neovascular and fibrous tissues. PEDCI for each component was compared among cases of acute and chronic CSCR. Results CMT and NSD-h decreased by 65.2 µm (p = 0.01), and 86.5 µm (p < 0.01) respectively at 12 months. At baseline, 7/17 acute CSCR eyes and 8/15 chronic CSCR eyes had a concomitant PED; acute cases had both serous and neovascular components (PEDCI-S: 16.95%, PEDCI-N: 40.3%), whereas chronic cases only had a neovascular component (PEDCI-S: 0%, PEDCI-N: 30.5%). At 12-month follow-up, 6/7 of acute CSCR group and 6/8 chronic CSCR group had a concomitant PED; PEDCI-S was largest for acute CSCR (53.4%) and PEDCI-N was largest for chronic CSCR (46.7%). Conclusion We identify a novel biomarker PEDCI to differentiate acute and chronic CSCR with higher PEDCI-S in acute CSCR, and higher PEDCI-N in chronic CSCR.
