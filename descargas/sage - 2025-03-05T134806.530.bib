N2 - In this paper, a bibliometric study on the interconnections between the fuzzy logic theory field and the other soft-computing techniques is presented. Bibliometric maps showing the associations between the main concepts between these research fields are provided for the periods 1990–1999, 2000–2003, and 2004–2007. The maps provide insight into the structure of these fields. They visualize the division of the field into several subfields and they indicate the relations between these subfields. The maps are created by co-word analysis. Experts can use these maps to forecast emerging trends for hybrid intelligent systems.

N2 - Widespread availability of electronic health records coupled with sophisticated statistical methods offer great potential for a variety of applications for health and disease surveillance, developing predictive models and advancing decision support for clinicians. However, use of “big data” mining and discovery techniques has also raised ethical issues such as how to balance privacy and autonomy with the wider public benefits of data sharing. Furthermore, electronic data are being increasingly used to identify individual characteristics, which can be useful for clinical prediction and management, but were not previously disclosed to a clinician. This process in computer parlance is called electronic phenotyping, and has a number of ethical implications. Using the Belmont Report’s principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice as a framework, we examined the ethical issues posed by electronic phenotyping. Ethical issues identified include the ability of the patient to consent for the use of their information, the ability to suppress pediatric information, ensuring that the potential benefits justify the risks of harm to patients, and acknowledging that the clinician’s biases or stereotypes, conscious or unintended, may become a factor in the therapeutic interaction. We illustrate these issues with two vignettes, using the person characteristic of gender minority status (i.e., transgender identity) and health history characteristic of substance abuse. Data mining has the potential to uncover patient characteristics previously obscured, which can provide clinicians with beneficial clinical information. Hence, ethical guidelines must be updated to ensure that electronic phenotyping supports the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.

N2 - An electrically conducting and magnetically influenced three-dimensional flow of modified nanofluid between two rotating disks is investigated in this study. Nanometer-size particles of two distinct materials (Al2O3, Ag) suspended in water in the hybrid nanofluid are considered. The Joule heating effects, mixed convection, chemical factor, and exponential heating are considered in this study. The physical problem under these assumptions is transformed into a system of equations. To convert partial differential equations (PDEs) into systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), the suitable similarity variables are introduced. The reduced system is numerically solved using bvp4c, a well-known higher-order algorithm. The effects of significant variables on the profiles of velocity, temperature, and concentration are depicted graphically. We have chosen the pertinent parameters in the specific intervals; , and . The interactions between a number of significant factors, including skin friction and Nusselt and Sherwood numbers at the higher and lower disks, are shown in tables. The results demonstrate that the local skin fraction decreases as the mixed convection factor is increased, which physically increases the heat transmission rate between the two discs. Furthermore, as the magnetic field and radiation number rise, the rate of heat transfer at the lower and top discs decreases. The numerical results in the form of a table are compared with the available literature, and our results beat the previously published work. The results described here are desirable choices for thermal uses such as automotive cooling systems, solar thermal systems, engineering, medical areas, heat sinks, or current energy storage since they have demonstrated higher thermal characteristics and stability than simple nanofluids (NFs). In Table 6, a comparative numerical study is presented for the various of state variables with the available literature, where the present study is validated.

N2 - Antibiotic resistance has become a serious global concern, and the discovery of antimicrobial herbal constituents may provide valuable solutions to overcome the problem. In this study, the effects of therapies combining antibiotics and four medicinal herbs on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were investigated. Specifically, the synergistic effects of Magnolia officinalis, Verbena officinalis, Momordica charantia, and Daphne genkwa in combination with oxacillin or gentamicin against methicillin-resistant (ATCC43300) and methicillin-susceptible (ATCC25923) S. aureus were examined. In vitro susceptibility and synergistic testing were performed to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index of the antibiotics and medicinal herbs against MRSA and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. To identify the active constituents in producing these synergistic effects, in silico molecular docking was used to investigate the binding affinities of 139 constituents of the four herbs to the two common MRSA inhibitory targets, penicillin binding proteins 2a (PBP2a) and 4 (PBP4). The physicochemical and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties and drug safety profiles of these compounds were also analyzed. D. genkwa extract potentiated the antibacterial effects of oxacillin against MRSA, as indicated by an FIC index value of 0.375. M. officinalis and V. officinalis produced partial synergistic effects when combined with oxacillin, whereas M. charantia was found to have no beneficial effects in inhibiting MRSA. Overall, tiliroside, pinoresinol, magnatriol B, and momorcharaside B were predicted to be PBP2a or PBP4 inhibitors with good drug-like properties. This study identifies compounds that deserve further investigation with the aim of developing therapeutic agents to modulate the effect of antibiotics on MRSA. Impact statement Antibiotic resistant is a well-known threat to global health and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most significant ones. These resistant bacteria kill thousands of people every year and therefore a new effective antimicrobial treatment is necessary. This study identified the herbs and their associated bioactive ingredients that can potential the effects of current antibiotics. These herbs have long history of human usage in China and have well-defined monograph in the Chinese Pharmacopeia. These indicate their relatively high clinical safety and may have a quicker drug development process than that of a new novel antibiotic. Based on the results of this study, the authors will perform further in vitro and animal studies, aiming to accumulate significant data for the application of clinical trial.

N2 - The selection of internal fixation as the primary fixation modality for the patient is one of the challenges for the surgeon treating the patient in question. A model of the lateral tibial plateau fracture was established. Three different configurations of internal fixators namely L bone plate, T bone plate, and screw-washer were analyzed. Three stages after surgery were simulated to assess the displacement of bone plates, screws, washers, and the stress shielding ratio in the fracture area. At three stages after surgery, the T bone plate showed better stability for patients during rehabilitation compared with the remaining two schemes, and the screw-washer scheme was the least stable due to the larger internal fixation displacement and stress shielding ratio in the fracture area. In contrast, the L bone plate scheme showed better stability in the early stages after surgery but was second only to the screw-washer scheme in the middle and late stages after surgery. The T bone plate showed better stability and became a new selection for surgeons to treat related patients. At three stages after surgery, the T bone plate has better biomechanical stability compared to the L bone plate and screw-washer schemes.

N2 - In 5 months of COVID isolation, living out of a suitcase in temporary housing, countless fractal patterns emerged. I can’t say if I created these patterns by looking for them, or that I know the whole world by looking at a grain of sand. The truth of the matter is that it feels like the key for massive scale change is just in front of us, but slipping from our grasp. As we move through these days, weeks, and months, we have very little time before the difference recedes again. I address this matter of concern as a matter of method in performative grounded theory piece.

N2 - Current reform efforts in science place a premium on student sense making and participation in the practices of science. Given the disparity between these activities and current teaching practices, effective means of professional development around such practices must be identified. We use a close examination of 106 science teachers participating in Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) to identify, through structural equation modeling, the essential features in supporting teacher learning from these experiences. Findings suggest that participation in RET shape science teacher practice and beliefs, which in turn influence practice. Essential features of RET include engaging teachers socially in the research context and in research projects that are personally relevant to them. The model suggests ways to maximize the professional development potential of RET intended to support engagement in disciplinary practices.

N2 - Serious games are a growing field in academic research and they are considered an effective tool for education. Game-based learning invokes motivation and engagement in students resulting in effective instructional outcomes. An essential aspect of a serious game is the method of support for presenting the teaching material and providing feedback. A support design that evaluates students’ progress and adapts accordingly, has the potential of producing better learning results. This paper presents an adaptive model based on fuzzy logic that adjusts the support acquisition according to student knowledge level. A serious game for teaching the concepts of sequence and iteration in programming to novice students was built to assess the model. It employs working examples as a support method since previous research indicated that it produced less cognitive load during problem-solving. An empirical study with 102 students has been conducted to evaluate the learning efficiency of the model. The analysis indicates positive results and a potential solution for balancing the amount of assistance in serious games.
