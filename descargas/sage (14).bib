N2 - Active student engagement, teaching via experience in real-life settings and learning by doing, are pedagogical strategies appropriate to improve student-reasoning skills. By building models, performing investigations, examining and explaining experimental results, using theoretical and computational thinking, constructing representations, undergraduates can acquire a deeper understanding of fundamental disciplinary concepts while reinforcing transversal abilities. In this framework, Engineering courses should be designed with the final objective to develop practical skills, focusing on hands-on activities. This contribution presents two different inquiry-based learning environments recently experienced at the University of Palermo in the context of bioelectronic and biomedical Engineering. The first study describes a laboratory activity about digital ophthalmologic signal classification; the second laboratory focuses on the analysis of the prefrontal cortex activation during a memory task using functional Near InfraRed Spectroscopy (fNIRS). We introduce and discuss the learning workshops, with the research objective of improving current instruction and training in Engineering courses. Indeed, this contribution aims to suggest a conceptual framework in the form of a structured elective suite of modules tailored to meet the needs of Engineering graduates. The outcomes of both studies seem to highlight that self-directed learning activities could enhance students’ enthusiasm to learn and engagement in engineering investigations, contributing to improve the achievements of students and acquire a more effective learning approach.

N2 - This paper explores how mechanical and aerospace engineering (MAE) students understand and improve their data proficiency throughout their engineering curriculum. Data is essential for engineering students to be proficient in handling, as it is involved in every aspect of engineering. With the growing ubiquity of data and data analysis in all engineering fields, engineering students need to learn and master data skills to be competitive in the current and future job market. However, there is a lack of research on how non-computer science or software engineering majors perceive data proficiency and how they seek opportunities to develop data skills, especially as it relates to specific subdomains. In this paper, we investigate how students perceive data proficiency and how they develop using interview data from N = 27 MAE students at a research institution in the southeastern United States. Using the How People Learn framework, we analyzed the data through thematic analysis methods with a postpositivist approach, considering the bounded context of this study. The results show that MAE students value data proficiency as a crucial skill for their future careers and recognize its importance in making evidence-based engineering decisions. The study also reveals that, even though data proficiency is often a “hidden competency,” MAE students intuitively find various ways to enhance their data skills. These findings may help engineering educators to tailor their instruction to their students’ needs, address misconceptions about data and data proficiency, and prepare a data-literate future engineering workforce.

N2 - This study critically reviews sixteen empirical studies that investigate the various difficulties that primary school students encounter while learning programming through educational games. Specifically, the challenges that students face in understanding basic programming concepts and the game elements that contribute to these difficulties, as well as the extent to which students can transfer the knowledge gained to contexts beyond games are analyzed. The results indicate that students primarily struggle with understanding loops (both simple and nested), while difficulties with selection structures and sequence structures are less pronounced. Regarding game elements, students face difficulties in interpreting command symbols representing directions, understanding graphical interface elements representing programming constructs, and managing complex user interfaces. The results imply a need for further empirical studies to explore how well students can apply their acquired programming knowledge to contexts beyond games. Although the need for further research is highlighted, the findings of the study provide valuable implications both to educators and game designers for a more effective incorporation of educational games to the teaching of programming, and a more straightforward depiction of programming concepts and a more user-friendly graphical user interface respectively.

N2 - The ever-increasing computational requirements of HPC and service provider applications are becoming a great challenge for hardware and software designers. These requirements are reaching levels where the isolated development on either computational field is not enough to deal with such challenge. A holistic view of the computational thinking is therefore the only way to success in real scenarios. However, this is not a trivial task as it requires, among others, of hardware–software codesign. In the hardware side, most high-throughput computers are designed aiming for heterogeneity, where accelerators (e.g. Graphics Processing Units (GPUs), Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), etc.) are connected through high-bandwidth bus, such as PCI-Express, to the host CPUs. Applications, either via programmers, compilers, or runtime, should orchestrate data movement, synchronization, and so on among devices with different compute and memory capabilities. This increases the programming complexity and it may reduce the overall application performance. This article evaluates different offloading strategies to leverage heterogeneous systems, based on several cards with the first-generation Xeon Phi coprocessors (Knights Corner). We use a 11-point 3-D Stencil kernel that models heat dissipation as a case study. Our results reveal substantial performance improvements when using several accelerator cards. Additionally, we show that computing of an approximate result by reducing the communication overhead can yield 23% performance gains for double-precision data sets.

N2 - As visions of smart urbanism gain traction around the world, it is crucial that we question the benefits that an increasingly technologised urbanity promise. It is not about the technology, but bettering peoples’ lives, insist smart city advocates. In this paper, I question the progressive potential of the smart city drawing on the case of Singapore’s Smart Nation initiative. Using the case studies of the smart home and ‘learning to code’ movement, I highlight the limits of such ‘smart’ interventions as they are stunted by the neoliberal-developmental logics of the state, thereby facilitating authoritarian consolidation in Singapore. As such, this paper distinguishes itself from previous works on the neoliberal smart city by situated smart urbanism within the socio-political dynamics of neoliberalism-as-developmental strategy. For smart urbanism to better peoples’ everyday lives, technological ‘solutionism’ needs to be replaced with more human-centric framings and understandings of urban challenges.

N2 - Traditional harmonic analysis annotations can be represented in a computer model of a piece of music by plain text strings. But whenever automated processing like analysis, comparison or retrieval is intended, a formal definition is helpful. This should cover not only the syntactic structure, but also the semantics, i.e. the intended meaning, and thus adheres to the technique of mathematical remodelling of existing cultural phenomena. The resulting models can serve as a basis for automated processing, but also help to clarify the communication and discussion among humans substantially. This article proposes such a definition in four layers, which address different problems of encoding and communication: (a) relation of symbol sequences to staff positions, (b) combining functions, (c) chord roots, and (d) interval structure and voice leading. Only one of them is specific to functional (Riemannian) theory and can possibly be replaced to represent scale degree theory. The proposal is configurable to different interval specification methods and open to localisation. Syntax and semantics are defined by precise mathematical means, borrowed from computer science, and thus are unambiguously documented.

N2 - The recent shift in compulsory education from ICT-focused computing curricula to informatics, digital literacy and computer science, has resulted in children being taught computing using block-based programming tools such as Scratch, with teaching that is often limited by school resources and teacher expertise. Even without these limitations, Scratch users often produce code with ‘code smells’ such as duplicate blocks and long scripts which impact how they understand and debug projects. These code smells can be removed using procedural abstraction, an important concept in computer science rarely taught to this age group. This article describes the design of a novel educational block-based programming game, Pirate Plunder, which concentrates on how procedural abstraction is introduced and reinforced. The article then reports an extended evaluation to measure the game’s efficacy with children aged 10 and 11, finding that children who played the game were then able to use procedural abstraction in Scratch. The article then uses game analytics to explore why the game was effective and gives three recommendations for educational game design based on this research: using learning trajectories and restrictive success conditions to introduce complex content, increasing learner investment through customisable avatars and suggestions for improving the evaluations of educational games.

N2 - Background: There has been a dearth of research on intersectional identities in STEM, including the fields of computing and engineering. In computing education research, much work has been done on broadening participation, but there has been little investigation into how the field of computer science (CS) presents opportunities for students with strong intersectional identities. This study explores the strengths and connections among the unique identities and the symbiotic relationships that elementary Latina students hold in CS identity attainment. Purpose: The aim of this article is to better understand how predominantly low-income, multilingual Latina students experience identity development through the lens of diverse group membership. We examine how young Latinas, through their participation in a yearlong culturally and linguistically responsive CS curriculum, leverage their intersecting identities to rewrite the formula of what a computer scientist is and can be, leaving space to include and invite other strong identities as well. Research Design: An explanatory sequential mixed-methods design was used that analyzed data from predominantly low-income, multilingual Latinas in upper elementary grades, including pre- and post-CS identity surveys (N = 50) delivered before and after implementation of the curriculum, and eight individual semi-structured student interviews. Findings: We found that Latina students developed significantly stronger identification with the field of CS from the beginning to the end of the school year with regard to their experiences with CS, perception of themselves as computer scientists, family support for CS and school, and friend support for CS and school. Interviews revealed that perception of their CS ability greatly influenced identification with CS and that girls’ self-perceptions stemmed from their school, cultural, and home learning environments. Conclusion: Our results highlight the wealth of resources that Latinas bring to the classroom through their home- and community-based assets, which are characterized by intersecting group membership. Students did not report on the intersection between language and CS identity development, which warrants further investigation.

N2 - To explore the role of design thinking in contemporary computer literacy education, this study aimed to examine the relationship between young students’ design thinking disposition and their computer programming self-efficacy. To assess students’ design thinking disposition, this study developed the Design Thinking Disposition Scale (DTDS) with a sample of 350 junior high school students who had computer programming experience in a STEAM course. A principle axis factor analysis with the promax rotation method was used to verify the DTDS’s construct under the four dimensions: empathize, define, ideate and prototype. The Cronbach’s alpha reliability was .90 for the overall scale. Correlation analyses results showed that all the four dimensions were significantly correlated with computer programming self-efficacy assessed by CPSES. A significant regression model was found in which the three factors, ideate, prototype and define, significantly predicted the overall computer programming self-efficacy. Meanwhile, except for the ideate subscale, no gender difference was found in the young students’ design thinking dispositions. The students’ self-directed programming learning experience was shown to benefit their design thinking disposition. The DTDS can be applied to design-thinking-embedded computer literacy curricula such as makers, STEAM, or robotics education. Several further studies are also suggested.
