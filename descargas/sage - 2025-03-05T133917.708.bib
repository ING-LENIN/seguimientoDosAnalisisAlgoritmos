N2 - Intelligent driving has been benefiting from advances in automotive big data analysis and on-demand data communications, where efficient vehicle-to-cloud communication is a key technology able to collect a huge amount of data from vehicles. However, as the capacities of the network and computational resources of the cloud are not unlimited, simultaneous data transfer based on a best-effort manner results in a resource starvation problem. Therefore, an application is needed to prioritize data communication to alleviate the problem and complete the data transfer just in time. This paper highlights the problem of resource starvation led by best-effort data transfers. It proposes protocols for data communication and control that could enable just-in-time data communication, notably for data collection. We demonstrate through experiments that the proposed mechanism enables efficient and effective data collection over the shared network resources.

N2 - BACKGROUND: Medial unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (UKA) could be concerned with wear of the cartilage or the wear in the polyethylene (PE) insert. Mechanical alignment determines the biomechanical effect in the long term. However, previous computational studies all found that femoral and tibial components alignment in the UKA were rare, and the results varied. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the biomechanical effect of the femoral and tibial component coronal alignment in varus and valgus conditions through computational simulation. METHODS: A three-dimensional finite element model of the intact knee was constructed from medical image data of one healthy subject. A medial UKA model of neutral position and various coronal components was developed from the intact knee joint model. The tibial varus-femoral valgus and tibial valgus-femoral varus conditions were analyzed with parallel component angles of 3°, 6° and 9° by using validated finite element models. We considered the contact stresses in the PE inserts and articular cartilage and the force on collateral ligament under gait cycle condition. RESULTS: Compared to the contact stress in the neutral position model, the contact stress on the PE insert increased in both tibial varus-femoral valgus and tibial valgus-femoral varus models. These trends were also observed in the case of the articular cartilage in remain compartment. However, the contact stress on the PE insert and articular cartilage increased largely in the tibial valgus-femoral varus model than in the tibial varus-femoral valgus model. The forces on the medial and lateral collateral ligaments increased in the tibial valgus-femoral varus model, whereas in the tibial varus-femoral valgus model, the forces decreased compared to the forces in the neutral position. The force on the anterior lateral ligament and popliteofibular ligament increased in the tibial varus-femoral valgus model as compared to the neutral position. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that neutral alignment or less than 3° tibial varus-femoral valgus alignment in the coronal plane can be recommended in medial UKA to reduce the postoperative complications and to enhance the life expectancy of implants.

N2 - Circuit dynamics are an outcome of the constant interplay between the intrinsic properties of neurons and the strengths of the synaptic connections among them. Examples from the small networks that generate the rhythms of the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion are used to illustrate general features of the different time scales over which both synaptic and intrinsic properties are altered by circuit activity and neuromodulation. These demonstrate that neither intrinsic membrane properties nor synaptic strengths should be considered fixed parameters; rather, they are dynamic variables with time scales that range from milliseconds to days.

N2 - Schools around the globe increasingly realized the importance of technology and its application in the education system. To guarantee a successful educational innovation, schools seek out different parties for valuable opinions. Among them, parents are the important feedback providers, because their attitudes are influential on children’s academic performance. Moreover, their involvement and support are considered the key factor that facilitates an effective implementation of programming education at schools. This study aimed at developing and validating an instrument measuring parents’ perceptions of programming education among P-12 schools in Hong Kong. We propose that parents’ perceptions of programming education is a multidimensional construct which constitutes (a) understanding, (b) support, and (c) expectation. In total, 524 questionnaires were collected from the parents who attended programming workshops and seminars. Exploratory factor analysis shows evidence for the three-dimensional construct. Confirmatory factor analysis reconfirms the measurement structure. Implications of the study are discussed.

N2 - We previously developed a core representation for computationally comparing the information an operator needs to perform a task and the information provided by a user interface. This representation is based on information theoretic properties, thus it can be applied to a wide variety of work domains and information and display types. In prior work, we used this capability to dynamically and automatically reconfigure cockpit displays for military cockpits. More recently, we adapted this approach to the task of evaluating and critiquing display format designs for NASA’s space operations. The representation and reasoning approach generalizes well to describing information types in procedural domains and the tool can analyze sets of display formats for sets of procedures, propose format improvements against a procedure set, project how changes to procedures will affect the suitability of existing formats, and project how changes to formats will improve or reduce their suitability for given procedures. Most recently, we have proposed extensions to evaluate and support “configuration consistency” of interfaces, within a system over time, across systems and even across vehicles and their associated work domains.

N2 - The process of coating textiles with a blade coater has been investigated with CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software. The simulations have uncovered a pressure drop in the area between the edge of the knife and the textile. This drop can be explained by the varying height of the flow channel which is made of the knife and the textile in conjunction with the no slip condition that is applied to the walls. In the simulations this drop became arbitrarily deep with increasing viscosity leading to negative absolute pressure levels. This may be a hint that the no slip condition is not valid in this scenario that involves shear rates of the order of 103/s and dynamic viscosities of around 10 to 100Pas. With a proposed slip condition for the textile the pressure drop became less pronounced. At the same time the flow rate through the gap between knife and textile was reduced leading to a thinner coating. This can be a hint that a slip between coating material and textile can cause distortions in the coating up to a complete disruption which is reported frequently by the industry. This could eventually be avoided by reducing the varying height of the flow channel. Alternatively a vertical lift of the textile due to the negative pressure was taken into account. This lift appeared only with low tensions of the textile of about 1N/m and showed no influence on coating thickness and pressure drop.
