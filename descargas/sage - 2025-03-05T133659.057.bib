N2 - The two-dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz instability which arises in two immiscible co-currently moving horizontal liquid layers is studied numerically. Two different methods for capturing the free interface movement are applied, namely the volume-of-fluid method and the level-set method. Both methods are very popular and available within commercial computational fluid dynamics tools. The wave is initialized using two different perturbations implemented into the model. As a case study, a system comprising a toluene layer and an aqueous layer is chosen. Numerical results obtained by both methods are in a good agreement with the linear stability theory for small wave amplitudes. The application of both methods is compared and their advantages and drawbacks are highlighted.

N2 - Temporality is an important aspect of political discourse. Politicians and policymakers attempt to construct the past and the future to gain power, legitimize their policies, claim success for themselves and blame others. To make computational analysis of temporality more accessible, we develop a new methodology using a semisupervised machine-learning algorithm called Latent Semantic Scaling. Only with a set of common verbs in the past perfect and future tense as seed words, the algorithm estimates the temporality of all other words. We demonstrate that it can identify temporal orientation of English and German sentences from election manifestos around 60–70% accurately, which is comparable to the results from a recent study based on supervised machine-learning algorithms. We also apply it to Twitter posts by German political parties to reveal temporal orientation of policy issues.

N2 - An effective method to reduce the violent motion behaviour of fast planing vessels in waves may be found in the application of active control devices in conjunction with advanced motion control systems. This study aims to develop a computational tool for the design and optimization of these ride control systems for high speed planing monohulls. Hydrodynamic characteristics of both transom flaps and interceptors are determined by systematic series of model test experiments in the towing tank of the Laboratory of Ship Hydromechanics at the Delft University of Technology. Transom flap results at downward deflection angles are validated with formulations found in literature. In addition, experiments at up angle flap positions have been performed to increase the range of application for motion control purposes. The hydrodynamic performance of the interceptors and transom flaps are compared in order to determine their efficiency. The experimental data was implemented in a nonlinear time domain mathematical model that can predict the seakeeping behaviour of fast monohulls. Simulations demonstrate the improvement in motion behaviour of a fast planing vessel with a ride control system sailing in head waves.

N2 - An aim of human factors research is to have models that allow for the advance design of user-friendly environments. This is still a distant dream because existing models are not yet sufficiently sophisticated. Models in the domain of motor control are a case in point, but recent developments in computational motor control suggest that the gap between the current state of modeling in this area and the desired state is shrinking. To illustrate this point, we review principles of motor control research that any model of motor control must accommodate. Then we describe a model that captures many of the capacities of actors in the everyday world, including the capacity to reach for objects in different ways depending on factors such as the ease with which different joints can rotate, the required speed of movement, and whether obstacles are present. The model relies on the ideas that goal postures are internally specified before movements are generated, that tasks are defined with flexibly ordered constraint hierarchies, and that movements can be shaped according to task demands. Actual or potential applications of this research include designing and testing possible environments where motor components play a key role.

N2 - Recently there has been an increase in the number of researchers who use rational choice models to explain single cases and rare events. Because of the small number of cases under study, these researchers must rely either explicitly or implicitly on counterfactual reasoning. This paper argues that computational methods provide a profitable means of carrying out rigorous counterfactual analysis. The authors advocate robustness analysis as one important part of the counterfactual analysis of formal theories. Specifically, they evaluate the robustness of the behavioral assumptions of two formal models using various heuristic search algorithms and Markov chains. They find that Kuran’s (1989) threshold model of mass protest and Ingberman’s (1985) model of direct-democracy referenda are robust to perturbations in their behavioral assumptions. These findings increase the plausibility of causal claims made by scholars who use these models to explain specific events.

N2 - The purpose of this article is to discuss the use of explicit instruction in the curriculum area of science where non–explicit approaches (e.g., discovery learning) are often used. While there has been a relative paucity of research on explicit instruction in science classrooms, we argue that explicit instruction, particularly when it is embedded within an inquiry approach aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards, has the potential to increase achievement in science for students with LD. Based on previous research, we provide potential ways to implement the five core instructional components of explicit instruction in today’s inquiry–based science classrooms.

N2 - Recognizer P systems with active membranes have proven to be very efficient computing devices, being able to solve NP-complete decision problems in a polynomial time. However such solutions usually exploit many powerful features, such as electrical charges (polarizations) associated to membranes, evolution rules, communication rules, and strong or weak forms of division rules. In this paper we contribute to the study of the computational power of polarizationless recognizer P systems with active membranes. Precisely, we show that such systems are able to solve in polynomial time the NP-complete decision problem 3-SAT by using only dissolution rules and a form of strong division for non-elementary membranes, working in the maximallly parallel way.
