abstract = {A computational means to assess the conspicuity of highway features was developed, verified, and then applied to a sample construction work zone scene. This work was conceived as a balance between modeling the complex phenomena within the human visual system and the need for a simple applications-oriented tool for practitioners to derive a quantitative relative assessment of real-world construction work zones to rank choices in terms of conspicuity. The results indicate that the vision model–based tool can assess the relative conspicuity of individual elements of a roadway or roadside scene and is relatively straightforward in use. As such, it holds potential value in virtual prototyping of work-zone sight lines, colors, and placement of hazard warning cues, such as cones, markings, and reflective vests.}

abstract = {The major objective of this study is to develop a computational fatigue test method for welded structures. The damage mechanics approach is used to derive explicit expressions for fatigue life estimation within the framework of continuum mechanics. Microdamage model is applied to calculate the quasi-brittle material damage prior to the crack initiation. Based on the two-scale model, that is, micro versus meso (macro) scale linkage scheme is implemented in conjunction with finite element method to describe the crack initiation or propagation. For the material damage model used at microscale, a finite element code is developed. Lemaitre’s unified damage model and constitutive equation were chosen so as to ensure the efficiency for developing finite element algorithm. Identification method for material parameters required to constitutive equation is proposed using inversion of Ramberg-Osgood type constitutive model. In order to consider weld-induced residual stresses, the Ueda’s inherent strain scheme is incorporated into the calculation of residual stresses. Computational procedure based on two-scale model with the use of commercial finite element code is successfully constructed. The numerical results obtained by proposed method are compared with experimental results for validation.}

abstract = {Computational brain models use machine learning, algorithms and statistical models to harness big data for delivering disease-specific diagnosis or prognosis for individuals. While intended to support clinical decision-making, their translation into clinical practice remains challenging despite efforts to improve implementation through training clinicians and clinical staff in their use and benefits. Drawing on the specific case of neurology, we argue that existing implementation efforts are insufficient for the responsible translation of computational models. Our research based on a collective seven-year engagement with the Human Brain Project, participant observation at workshops and conferences, and expert interviews, suggests that relationships of trust between clinicians and researchers (modellers, data scientists) are essential to the meaningful translation of computational models. In particular, efforts to increase model transparency, strengthen upstream collaboration, and integrate clinicians’ perspectives and tacit knowledge have the potential to reinforce trust building and increase translation of technologies that are beneficial to patients.}

abstract = {Background BLOCKYLAND is a city building game based on the concept of cellular automata (CA), and urban cellular automata. The game has CA-like processes that invert the role of players from passive observers in other CA applications to active thinkers. The processes challenge players to apply logical thinking and decision making from the perspective of serious games. The players’ mission is to build a city by applying the provided CA rules. Two types of CA rules are provided: 1) The logical rule, whereby players apply to build the city according to the preset conditions, and 2) The optional rule, whereby they may apply to upgrade an existing building for an extra score. Aim This article aims to present the design and development of CA-based game, BLOCKYLAND and describe its effectiveness as an instructional tool to enhance logical thinking. Results Results from the mixed-method pilot study show that BLOCKYLAND enhanced players’ logical thinking after the gameplay. Additionally, from the extensive debriefing following the game, participants stated that the game aided them with transforming their game experiences into learning experiences and relating the logical thinking practice into real-life application. Results Conclusion. As a combination of logical thinking practices and a serious game, BLOCKYLAND has several implications for educational stakeholders; both theoretical and practical.}

abstract = {Abstract A study has been undertaken to assess the capability of incorporating different empirical approaches in a computational ftuid dynamics (CFD) environment for predicting boiling heat transfer. The application is for internal combustion (IC) engine cooling galleries and experimental validation work has been undertaken. Three different boiling heat transfer models are described, one based on the principle of superposition (Chen) and two based on the partial boiling method (Thom and Cipolla). Overall, the Thom partial boiling approach was found to be the most representative of the three considered. However, numerous issues were found to be evident whatever approach was adopted and these are discussed in the paper. The partial boiling model was found to be the most simple to incorporate in the CFD model.}

abstract = {Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010, a substantial body of research has focused on the development of computational tools and analytical frameworks for modeling oil spill events. Much of this work is dedicated to deepening our understanding of the interactions between oil, fragile ecosystems, and the environment, as well as the impacts of oil on human settlements which are vulnerable to spill events. These advances in oil spill modeling and associated analytics have not only increased the efficiency of spill interdiction and mitigation efforts, they have also helped to nurture proactive, versus reactive, response strategies and plans for local and regional stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to provide a progress report on the wide range of computational tools, analytical frameworks, and emerging technologies which are necessary inputs for a complete oil spill modeling package. Specifically, we explore the use of relatively mature tools, such as dedicated spill modeling packages, geographic information systems (GIS), and remote sensing, as well emerging technologies such as aerial and aquatic drones and other in-situ sensing technologies. The integration of these technologies and the advantages associated with using a geographic lens for oil spill modeling are discussed.}

The most advantageous aspect of this component-oriented framework is that it contributes toward developing various service applications for ubiquitous computation as the occasion demands. That is, service applications are expected to do modeling, simulation, monitoring, Web services, and other applications. The author also discusses the relative issues on making a coordinating bridge between behavioral sciences and multiagent systems.}
