N2 - Background: Women and people of color are consistently underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields and careers. Though there are myriad factors underlying these gaps, one potential variable may be the extent to which these students feel connected to their STEM classroom experiences. Purpose: The present study investigated the potential of a service-learning experience to support STEM engagement for underrepresented youth. Methodology/Approach: Two cohorts of high school students participated in a summer program through which they built “solar suitcases” to provide electricity for communities in need. Observations and student surveys measured student engagement and changes in STEM attitudes, dispositions, and beliefs. Findings/Conclusions: Students were highly engaged in service-learning activities and demonstrated improved Science Fascination, Science Values, and STEM Career Affinity after participating in the program. Implications: Implications for the design and delivery of culturally relevant service-learning experiences are discussed.

N2 - The debate over symbolic versus sub-symbolic representations of human cognition has been continuing for thirty years, with little indication of a resolution. The argument is this: Does the human cognitive system use symbols as a representation of knowledge, and does it process symbols and their respective constituents? Or does the human cognitive system use a distributed representation of knowledge, and is it somehow capable of processing this distributed representation of knowledge in a complex and meaningful way? This paper argues for an integrated symbolic and sub-symbolic approach to the representation of cognition. The lines of reasoning used as evidence to bolster this argument for an integrated approach are the cognitive architecture the Adaptive Character of Thought-Rational (ACT-R), and biology, where it is argued that symbolic and sub-symbolic representations of cognition are part of an intellectual continuum, with sub-symbolic representations at the low end and symbolic representations at the higher end.

N2 - An engine is being developed to utilise some of the heat of a wood-burning stove to produce a small quantity of electricity. The heat is used to maintain a temperature gradient in a regenerator consisting of very narrow passages in which the gas (air) is in intimate thermal contact with the material. By the thermo-acoustic principle, a strong sound wave can be developed if the regenerator is incorporated in an acoustic loop so that acoustic energy is returned to it and amplified. The excess power generated can be extracted by a linear alternator. This article describes a model of the thermal, acoustic and electrical processes, and a procedure for calculating the performance of a complete loop. Comparison of the computed results with data from three configurations of apparatus shows that the acoustic elements of the problem are quite accurately described. However, there are discrepancies between the calculated thermal and electrical parameters, and the limited measurements for a practically useful arrangement of the components.

N2 - There are two very different approaches to understand functioning of the brain. First, there is a huge progress in the research of the neurological and neurophysiological properties of different brain substructures, circuits, networks, single cells, synapses and their molecular properties. It contributes to the progress of research in the fields of basic medical sciences and the dramatic increase in average life expectancy. On the another side that does not directly follows neurological developments, it is our introspection related to individual ways of thinking in order to solve different problems that also involve human creativity (cognitive theory of mind). We use many diverse ways of thinking, and they depend on different circumstances. Especially interesting are influences of intuition, feelings and emotions on our creativity, which is in a large part are also related to the social interactions (affective empathy). In this work, we formalise emotional scales and transfer of emotions between individuals (social emotional thinking). We also demonstrate a continuity of the emotion transfer mappings, and an importance of the interactions between emotional faces. It is not only human specific to show and to react to face emotions, but strong and wide human social interactions are based on the precise emotional social thinking. By measuring critical values of face deformations that may influence mutual emotions, we can test precision and tolerance of human visual and emotional systems. By introduction indiscernibility relations between individual reading of face parts deformation, we have used rough set theory to probe social emotional thinking. As one of us have demonstrated that the visual system has properties that follows rough set theory (cognitive theory of mind), this work extends this concept to the social emotional interactions (cognitive and affective theory of mind). As in modern world IT - information technology - has became driving factor in the process of globalisation by creating effective channels of information exchange; hence it becomes extremely important to analyse emotional meaning (cognitive empathy) for this vast information flow. By using as described here, rough set theory to determine, which parts of information have significant emotional influence, our model may give grounds to increase the collective well-being.

N2 - This editorial article describes the Journal of Economic and Social Measurement. It discusses the evolution of this journal during the past thirty plus years of its publication. In the process, it identifies the range of topics that have been historically addressed as a means of suggesting types of possible future articles. It includes both a statement of editorial policies and information about normal selection procedures. This article therefore serves to define the scope of this journal, but fundamentally should be understood as intended to be suggestive, rather than either prescriptive or restrictive. The journal’s essential characteristic is both to act as a complement to the standard disciplinary journals and to be innovative in its acceptance of new ideas and methods.

N2 - This paper introduces a model for analyzing the aesthetic value of game rules. Drawing on Nguyen’s theory of agential aesthetics, this paper argues that the aesthetic value of a rule is related to the ways in which it contains modalities of agency. Using football’s (soccer) offside rule as a case study, this article provides a way of thinking about the aesthetics of game rules.

N2 - Specific genetic abnormalities (alterations in growth-related genes), either inherited or acquired during lifetimes, may deregulate normal cell growth by interfering with very basic cellular, biochemical and biophysical processes. In order to be able to prevent such unregulated growth of cells, which may lead to cancer, we will have to understand the basic principles of genome organisation better, the mechanisms of genetic information storage, and the molecular structure and functioning of the genes and gene families themselves. This review gives a short overview of the various hierarchical levels at which an attempt is made, using different methods, to collect genomic information relevant to cancer research. We will start with cytogenetic and genetic linkage maps at the lowest resolution, work with ordered clone and complementary DNA libraries and with nucleotide sequences at medium resolution, and investigate fine details of the atomic and electronic structures of the molecules involved at the highest resolution. Very different disciplines – biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, genetics, artificial intelligence research and others – have to cooperate closely in approaching the above-mentioned ambitious goals. One of their common denominators is their intensive use of computers as tools in organising genomic information and in trying to convert it to biological knowledge.
