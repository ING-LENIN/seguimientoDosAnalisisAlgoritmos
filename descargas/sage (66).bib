N2 - This article presents an experimental and computational study of the efficiency of an unshrouded transonic turbine. This research formed part of the EU Turbine Aero-Thermal External Flows II programme. The experiments were performed in the Oxford Turbine Research Facility (previously the Turbine Test Facility at QinetiQ, Farnborough). This facility is an engine scale, short duration, rotating transonic facility, in which M, Re, , and are matched to engine conditions. For these experiments, the MT1 turbine stage was installed. Historically, turbine efficiency measurements are conducted in steady state adiabatic facilities. However, short-duration facilities allow simultaneous aerodynamic and heat transfer measurements with a significant reduction in cost. An efficiency measurement system was developed for this investigation, and this is briefly described. The system allows efficiency to be evaluated to bias and precision errors of approximately ±1.45 per cent and ±0.16 per cent, respectively, to 95 per cent confidence. The results of accurate area surveys of the turbine inlet and exit flows are presented and discussed. At the turbine exit, data were taken at two traverse planes, approximately 0.5 and 4.5 rotor axial chords downstream of the rotor. The turbine efficiency was experimentally evaluated based on the data at both planes, using a number of mixing models, which are discussed and compared. The experimental result of turbine efficiency is also compared to that estimated from a mean-line prediction. Full-stage steady and unsteady computational fluid dynamics of the experiment using the Rolls-Royce HYDRA code was conducted and is also presented. The predicted and measured rotor exit flow-fields are compared at both downstream traverse planes.

N2 - The capacity to explain important elements of social life is central both to the development of sociological theory and to teaching sociology. This research seeks to expand our understanding of sociological explanation through a computational approach. Explanations commonly encountered in introductory sociology texts are used to develop a typology of explanatory forms. A computational strategy that represents sociological knowledge using a combination of frames, semantic networks, and procedural rules is described. It is then demonstrated that this approach can generate the full range of these explanations for all logical combinations of conditions and for the full scope of sociological knowledge. This approach is also shown to be capable of identifying appropriate explanations, assessing the quality of explanations, and generating new insights.

N2 - Apoptosis is the phenotypic result of an active, regulated process of self-destruction. Following various cellular insults, apoptosis has been demonstrated in numerous unicellular eukaryotes, but very little is known about the genes and proteins that initiate and execute this process in this group of organisms. A bioinformatic approach presents an array of powerful methods to direct investigators in the identification of the apoptosis machinery in protozoans. In this review, we discuss some of the available computational methods and illustrate how they may be applied using the identification of a Plasmodium falciparum metacaspase gene as an example.

N2 - During crisis situations, teams are more prone to coordination breakdowns that are characterized by a temporary, diminished ability to function effectively as a team. However, team research currently lacks robust approaches for identifying transitions from effective team functioning to coordination breakdowns. With the current study, we aimed to develop such robust approaches, and to deepen our understanding of how team coordination dynamics across various physiological signals reflect coordination breakdowns. Consequently, we used audiovisual data from four-person teams involved in a stressful collaborative game task to manually identify coordination breakdowns. Next, we set out to computationally identify coordination breakdowns by applying continuous measures of team coordination (windowed synchronization coefficient and multidimensional recurrence quantification analysis) to photoplethysmogram and electrodermal activity data obtained during the task, and identifying transitions therein with change point and nonlinear prediction algorithms. We found that our computational coordination breakdown identification approaches can identify up to 96% of the manually identified coordination breakdowns although our results also show that the precision of our approaches falls far behind. Our findings contribute theoretically and methodologically to the systematic investigation of coordination breakdowns, which may ultimately facilitate the support of teams in responding to and mitigating negative consequences of crisis situations.

N2 - The aim of this paper is to outline a priori performance evaluation approaches for distributed solution concepts of simulation-based optimization problems. Practical optimization problems, a distributed solution approach, and specific characteristics of the situation are presented. This parallel system is then analyzed according to both approaches of computational complexity and scalability. To overcome the resulting drawbacks, the integration of a posteriori aspects is necessary. Thus, a generic metric is established providing a posteriori knowledge at early stages of the optimization process.

N2 - Saint Louis encephalitis virus, a member of the flaviviridae subgroup, is a culex mosquito-borne pathogen. Despite severe epidemic outbreaks on several occasions, not much progress has been made with regard to an epitope-based vaccine designed for Saint Louis encephalitis virus. The envelope proteins were collected from a protein database and analyzed with an in silico tool to identify the most immunogenic protein. The protein was then verified through several parameters to predict the T-cell and B-cell epitopes. Both T-cell and B-cell immunity were assessed to determine that the protein can induce humoral as well as cell-mediated immunity. The peptide sequence from 330–336 amino acids and the sequence REYCYEATL from the position 57 were found as the most potential B-cell and T-cell epitopes, respectively. Furthermore, as an RNA virus, one important thing was to establish the epitope as a conserved one; this was also done by in silico tools, showing 63.51% conservancy. The epitope was further tested for binding against the HLA molecule by computational docking techniques to verify the binding cleft epitope interaction. However, this is a preliminary study of designing an epitope-based peptide vaccine against Saint Louis encephalitis virus; the results awaits validation by in vitro and in vivo experiments.

N2 - Bioreactor system has been used in bone tissue engineering in order to simulate dynamic nature of bone tissue environments. Perfusion bioreactors have been reported as the most efficient types of shear-loading bioreactor. Also, combination of forces, such as rotation plus perfusion, has been reported to enhance cell growth and osteogenic differentiation. Mathematical modeling using sophisticated infrastructure processes could be helpful and streamline the development of functional grafts by estimating and defining an effective range of bioreactor settings for better augmentation of tissue engineering. This study is aimed to conduct computational modeling for newly designed bioreactors in order to alleviate the time and material consuming for evaluating bioreactor parameters and effect of fluid flow hydrodynamics (various amounts of shear stress) on osteogenesis. Also, biological assessments were performed in order to validate similar parameters under implementing the perfusion or rotating and perfusion fluid motions in bioreactors’ prototype. Finite element method was used to investigate the effect of hydrodynamic of fluid flow inside the bioreactors. The equations used in the simulation to calculate the velocity values and consequently the shear stress values include Navier–Stokes and Brinkman equations. It has been shown that rotational fluid motion in rotating and perfusion bioreactor produces more velocity and shear stress compared with perfusion bioreactor. Moreover, implementing the perfusion together with rotational force in rotating and perfusion bioreactors has been shown to have more cell proliferation and higher activity of alkaline phosphatase enzyme as well as formation of extra cellular matrix sheet, as an indicator of bone-like tissue formation.

N2 - A computational approach to visual perception is outlined. The investigation centres on two problems. One concerns the shape, and the other the edges, of dot figures. In determining edges it is not possible to delimit arbitrarily the region on which each point computes. So in this context a global computation is defined. This leads to a novel way of investigating clustering. When the edges of a figure have been sequenced to yield the boundary it is then possible to determine its shape. The study of shape has been confined to convex figures. In these an attempt is made to extract global units which correspond to corner-like regions. Finally, it is suggested that a theory which evolves in the manner described has a more unitary aspect than other approaches.

N2 - Background and purpose: Computational fluid dynamics method (CFDM) and optical flow method (OFM) effectively provide the hemodynamic information based on the digital subtraction angiogram (DSA). However, the quantitative analysis in comparison of CFDM and OFM is still absent. The goal of this study is to apply CFDM and OFM in quantitative analysis of stenting treatment. Material and method: A left carotid stenosis patient underwent stenting of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty was analyzed as an example. CFDM and OFM for hemodynamic analysis on digital subtraction angiography before and after stenting treatment were presented. Results: Improvement gains of blood flow velocities on left internal carotid artery after stenting treament for different initial conditions on the common carotid artery were 1.91 ∼ 2.13, 1.62 ∼ 2.09, and 0.69 by CFDM with Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids and OFM, respectively. With the CFDM analysis, the flow mapping by OFM using time resolved DSA data on the fly to estimate hemodynamic significance of a cervical carotid stenosis was explained. Conclusion: Quantificative blood flow estimations by CFDM and OFM to evaluate the treatment outcomes to patient with carotid stenosis are practical. Both methods are able to provide quantitative information of blood flow for stenting treatment. It is advantagious to use both methods in treatment evaluation.

N2 - Study Design Mechanical simulations. Objective Inadequate calibration of annuli negatively affects the computational accuracy of finite element (FE) models. Specifically, the definition of annulus average radius (AR) does not have uniformity standards. Differences between the elastic moduli in the different layers and parts of the annulus were not fully calibrated when a linear elastic material is used to define its material properties. This study aims to optimize the computational accuracy of the FE model by calibrating the annulus. Methods We calibrated the annulus AR and elastic modulus in our anterior-constructed lumbar model by eliminating the difference between the computed range of motion and that measured by in vitro studies under a flexion-extension loading condition. Multi-indicator validation was performed by comparing the computed indicators with those measured in in vitro studies. The computation time required for the different models has also been recorded to evaluate the computational efficiency. Results The difference between computed and measured ROMs was less than 1% when the annulus AR and elastic modulus were calibrated. In the model validation process, all the indicators computed by the calibrated FE model were within ±1 standard deviation of the average values obtained from in vitro studies. The maximum difference between the computed and measured values was less than 10% under nearly all loading conditions. There is no apparent variation tendency for the computational time associated with different models. Conclusion The FE model with calibrated annulus AR and regional elastic modulus has higher computational accuracy and can be used in subsequent mechanical studies.
