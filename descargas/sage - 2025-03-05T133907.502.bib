abstract = {This study examines the ways prospective elementary teachers (PSTs) made connections to children’s mathematical thinking and children’s community funds of knowledge in mathematics lesson plans. We analyzed the work of 70 PSTs from across three university sites associated with an instructional module for elementary mathematics methods courses that asks PSTs to visit community settings and develop problem solving mathematics lessons that connect to mathematical practices in these settings (Community Mathematics Exploration Module). Using analytic induction, we identified three distinct levels of connections to children’s mathematical thinking and their community funds of knowledge evidenced in PSTs’ work (emergent, transitional, and meaningful). Findings describe how these connections reflected different points on a learning trajectory. This study has implications for understanding how PSTs begin to connect to children’s mathematical funds of knowledge in their teaching, a practice shown to be effective for teaching diverse groups of children.}

abstract = {The ability to acquire a representation of the spatial environment and the ability to localize within it are essential for successful navigation in a-priori unknown environments. The hippocampal forma tion is believed to play a key role in spatial learning and localization in animals in general and rodents in particular. This paper briefly reviews the relevant neurobiological and cognitive data, and their relation to computational models of spatial learning and localization used in contempo rary mobile robots. It proposes a hippocampal model of spatial learning and localization, and characterizes it using a Kalman filter based tool for information fusion from multiple uncertain sources. The resulting model not only explains neurobiological and behavioral data from rodent experiments, but also allows a robot to learn a place-based metric representation of space and to localize itself in a stochastically optimal manner. The paper presents an algorithmic implementa tion of the model and results of several experiments that demonstrate its capabilities. These include the ability to disambiguate perceptually similar places, scale well with increasing errors, and the automatic acquisition of spatial information at multiple resolutions.}

abstract = {Introduction: Predicting Self-interacting proteins (SIPs) is a crucial area of research in predicting protein functions, as well as in understanding gene-disease and disease-drug associations. These interactions are integral to numerous cellular processes and play pivotal roles within cells. However, traditional methods for identifying SIPs through biological experiments are often expensive, time-consuming, and have long cycles. Therefore, the development of effective computational methods for accurately predicting SIPs is not only necessary but also presents a significant challenge. Results: In this research, we introduce a novel computational prediction technique, VGGNGLCM, which leverages protein sequence data. This method integrates the VGGNet deep convolutional neural network (VGGN) with the Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) to detect Self-interacting proteins associations. Specifically, we initially utilized Position Specific Scoring Matrix (PSSM) to capture protein evolutionary information and integrated key features from PSSM using GLCM. We then employed VGGNet as a predictive classifier, leveraging its capabilities for powerful learning and classification prediction. Subsequently, the extracted features were input into the VGGNet deep convolutional neural network to identify Self-interacting proteins. To evaluate the performance of the VGGNGLCM model, we conducted experiments using yeast and human datasets, achieving average accuracies of 95.68% and 97.72% respectively. Additionally, we compared the prediction performance of the VGGNet classifier with that of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the state-of-the-art Support Vector Machine (SVM) using the same feature extraction method. We also compared the prediction ability of VGGNGLCM with other existing approaches. The comparison results further demonstrate the superior performance of VGGNGLCM over other prediction models in this domain. Conclusion: The experimental verification further strengthens the evidence that VGGNGLCM is effective and robust compared to existing methods. It also highlights the high accuracy and robustness of the VGGNGLCM model in predicting Self-interacting proteins (SIPs). Consequently, we believe that the VGGNGLCM method serves as a valuable computational tool and can catalyze extensive bioinformatics research related to SIPs prediction.}

abstract = {Abstract Since ballistic and blast survivability and off-road handling and stability of military vehicles, such as the high-mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV), are two critical vehicle performance aspects, they both (including the delicate balance between them) have to be considered when a new vehicle is being designed or an existing vehicle retrofitted (e.g. up-armoured). Finite-element-based transient non-linear dynamics and multi-body longitudinal dynamics computational analyses were employed, relatively, in the present work to address the following two specific aspects of the performance of an HMMWV: first, the ability of the vehicle to survive detonation of a landmine shallow buried into sand underneath the right wheel of the vehicle and, second, the ability of the vehicle to withstand a simple straight-line brake manoeuvre during off-road travel without compromising its stability and safety of its occupants. Within the first analysis, the kinematic and structural responses (including large-scale rotation and deformation, buckling, plastic yielding, failure initiation, fracture, and fragmentation) of the HMMWV to the detonation of a landmine were analysed computationally using the general-purpose transient non-linear dynamics analysis software ABAQUS/Explicit. The second analysis was carried out using Simpack, a general-purpose multi-body dynamics program, and the main purpose of this analysis was to address the vehicle stability during the off-road travel. The same sand model was used in both types of analysis. Finally, the computational results obtained are compared with general field-test observations and data in order to judge the physical soundness and fidelity of the present approach.}

abstract = {Schools around the globe increasingly realized the importance of technology and its application in the education system. To guarantee a successful educational innovation, schools seek out different parties for valuable opinions. Among them, parents are the important feedback providers, because their attitudes are influential on children’s academic performance. Moreover, their involvement and support are considered the key factor that facilitates an effective implementation of programming education at schools. This study aimed at developing and validating an instrument measuring parents’ perceptions of programming education among P-12 schools in Hong Kong. We propose that parents’ perceptions of programming education is a multidimensional construct which constitutes (a) understanding, (b) support, and (c) expectation. In total, 524 questionnaires were collected from the parents who attended programming workshops and seminars. Exploratory factor analysis shows evidence for the three-dimensional construct. Confirmatory factor analysis reconfirms the measurement structure. Implications of the study are discussed.}

To randomize each respondent to a group and treatment and to test of several hypotheses simultaneously, two by two factorial design was used. An online survey (N = 1160) on Iranian social media revealed that overclaiming and social approval are positively related to sharing fake news on social media. Surprisingly, analytical thinking yielded no significance. We believe that in order to show more knowledge users tend to share information with high social approval irrespective of their credibility. Although CRT proved no relation with sharing, significant differences among male and female users were found. The proven relation between sharing more and overclaiming more reveals a marketing opportunity. Gamification of communication which provides a vehicle for users to overclaim their knowledge to their peers on social media might be a suitable strategy on social media to spread the message.}

abstract = {Background Endoscopic medial maxillectomy (EMM) is a workhorse for multiple sinonasal conditions. To reduce its burden on the sinonasal physiology, several modified EMM (M-EMM) have been proposed. Objective: In order to provide a theoretical basis for EMM and its modifications, this study introduces a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, based on a time-resolved direct numerical simulation, describing EMM and assessing the role of the M-EMM in preserving the overall fluid dynamics of the sinonasal cavities. Methods A normal sinonasal CT scan was converted into a geometrical model and used as a reference; 2 anatomies were then created by virtual surgery, mimicking EMM and M-EMM, with the latter sparing the anterior portion of inferior turbinate and medial maxillary sinus wall. The airflow was simulated in the models via the OpenFOAM CFD software and compared in terms of flow rate, mean and fluctuating velocity, vorticity, and turbulent structures. Results The analysis shows that EMM induces a massive flow rate increase in the operated side, which becomes less obvious in the M-EMM model. In contrast to M-EMM, EMM induces higher velocity fields that reach the maxillary sinus. Velocity and vorticity fluctuations are negligible in the baseline model, but become increasingly evident and widespread in the M-EMM and EMM models. Conclusions A significant disruption of the nasal fluid dynamics is observed in EMM, while M-EMM minimizes variations and reduces interference with nasal air conditioning. Our analysis provides insights into the pathophysiology of radical sinus surgery and provides a theoretical basis for the ability of M-EMM to reduce the temporary surgery-related changes on both healthy and operated sides.}

abstract = {A comprehensive computational study, in both steady and unsteady flow conditions, has been carried out to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics of the Risø-B1-18 airfoil equipped with variable trailing edge geometry as produced by a hinged flap. The function of such flaps should be to decrease fatigue-inducing oscillations on the blades. The computations were conducted using a 2D incompressible RANS solver with a k-w turbulence model under the assumption of a fully developed turbulent flow. The investigations were conducted at a Reynolds number of Re = 1.6 · 106. Calculations conducted on the baseline airfoil showed excellent agreement with measurements on the same airfoil with the same specified conditions. Furthermore, a more widespread comparison with an advanced potential theory code is presented. The influence of various key parameters, such as flap shape, flap size and oscillating frequencies, was investigated so that an optimum design can be suggested for application with wind turbine blades. It is concluded that a moderately curved flap with flap chord to airfoil curve ratio between 0.05 and 0.10 would be an optimum choice.}
