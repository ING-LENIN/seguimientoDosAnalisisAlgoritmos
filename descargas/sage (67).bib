N2 - Introduction: The emergence of new omics approaches, such as genomic algorithms to identify tumor mutations and molecular modeling tools to predict the three-dimensional structure of proteins, has facilitated the understanding of the dynamic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of low-grade gliomas including oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. Methods: In this study, we targeted known mutations involved in low-grade gliomas, starting with the sequencing of genomic regions encompassing exon 4 of isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) and the four exons (5-6 and 7-8) of TP53 from 32 samples, followed by computational analysis to study the impact of these mutations on the structure and function of 3 proteins IDH1, IDH2, and p53. Results: We obtain a mutation that has an effect on the catalytic site of the protein IDH1 as R132H and on the catalytic site of the protein IDH2 as R172M. Other mutations at p53 have been identified as K305N, which is a pathogenic mutation; R175 H, which is a benign mutation; and R158G, which disrupts the structural conformation of the tumor suppressor protein. Conclusion: In low-grade gliomas, mutations in IDH1, IDH2, and TP53 may be the key to tumor progression because they have an effect on the function of the protein such as mutations R132H in IDH1 and R172M in IDH2, which change the function of the enzyme alpha-ketoglutarate, or R158G in TP53, which affects the structure of the generated protein, thus their importance in understanding gliomagenesis and for more accurate diagnosis complementary to the anatomical pathology tests.

N2 - Programming learning has become an essential literacy for computer science (CS) and non-CS students in the digital age. Researchers have addressed that students’ conceptions of learning influence their approaches to learning, and thus impact their learning outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to uncover students’ conceptions of programming learning (CoPL) and approaches to programming learning (APL), and analyzed the differences between CS and non-CS students. Phenomenographic analysis was adopted to analyze 31 college students (20 CS-related, and 11 not) from northern Taiwan. Results revealed six categories of CoPL hierarchically: 1. memorizing concepts, logic, and syntax, 2. computing and practicing programming writing, 3. expressing programmers’ ideas and relieving pressure, 4. applying and understanding, 5. increasing one’s knowledge and improving one’s competence, and 6. seeing in a new way. Four categories of APL were also found, namely: 1. copying from the textbook, teachers, or others, 2. rote memory, 3. multiple exploration attempts, and 4. online or offline community interactions. Furthermore, we found that most CS students held higher level CoPL (e.g., seeing in a new way) than non-CS students. However, compared with non-CS students, CS students adopted more surface approaches to learning programming, such as copying and rote memory. Implications are discussed.

N2 - Apoptosis is the phenotypic result of an active, regulated process of self-destruction. Following various cellular insults, apoptosis has been demonstrated in numerous unicellular eukaryotes, but very little is known about the genes and proteins that initiate and execute this process in this group of organisms. A bioinformatic approach presents an array of powerful methods to direct investigators in the identification of the apoptosis machinery in protozoans. In this review, we discuss some of the available computational methods and illustrate how they may be applied using the identification of a Plasmodium falciparum metacaspase gene as an example.

N2 - Contemporary education policy involves the integration of novel forms of data and the creation of new data platforms, in addition to the infusion of business principles into school governance networks, and intensification of socio-technical relations. In this paper, we examine how ‘computational rationality’ may be understood as intensifying of an instrumental set of logics in educational governance and decision making, and/or as opening up new explorations around the uncertainty and incompleteness of policy. We suggest that policy rationalities focused on prediction, transparency and data provide the conditions of possibility for Artificial Intelligence to be integrated into, and intensify aspects of, what we term ‘computational education policy’.

N2 - This article examines the impact of programming robots on sequencing ability in early childhood. Thirty-four children (ages 4.5–6.5 years) participated in computer programming activities with a developmentally appropriate tool, CHERP, specifically designed to program a robot’s behaviors. The children learned to build and program robots over three sessions, of 1.5 hours duration each, in a laboratory setting. The participants’ sequencing skills were assessed before and after the intervention using a picture-story sequencing task. Pre- and post-test scores were compared using a paired sample t-test. A significant increase in post-test scores compared to pre-test scores was found.

N2 - Rigidity of thought is considered a main characteristic of persons with Asperger syndrome (AS). This rigidity may explain the poor comprehension of unusual semantic relations, frequently exhibited by persons with AS. Research indicates that such deficiency is related to altered mental lexicon organization, but has never been directly examined. The present study used computational network science tools to compare the mental lexicon structure of persons with AS and matched controls. Persons with AS and matched controls generated free associations, and network tools were used to extract and compare the mental lexicon structure of the two groups. The analysis revealed that persons with AS exhibit a hyper-modular semantic organization: their mental lexicon is more compartmentalized compared to matched controls. We argue that this hyper-modularity may be related to the rigidity of thought which characterizes persons with AS and discuss the clinical and more general cognitive implications of our findings.

N2 - Partly presented in Interdisciplinary Transport Phenomena VII, Dresden, Germany, 19–23 September 2011.Compression moulding experiments of sheet moulding compound, visual observations of a vacuum test with prepregs and numerical models with two main approaches for computational fluid dynamics simulations of the mould filling phase are presented. One assumes that there are layers near the mould surfaces with much less viscosity and the other only use one viscosity model. The numerical experiments showed that the pressure could be accurately predicted with both approaches. The property necessary to predict correct pressure with altered mould closing velocities was that the bulk material had to obey shear-thinning effects. Preheating effects before compression were neglected, but altering the heating time until the prepreg was assumed to start flow had a significant effect. The experiments confirmed that the pressure is predominantly affected by the mould closing velocity. Regardless of the considered process settings, a first pressure top always appeared approximately at the logarithmic strain 0.25. A second top was associated with a slowdown of the press. The location of this was affected by the velocity and the vacuum, the latter indicating that vacuum assistance prevents a build-up of back pressure. Furthermore, heated prepreg above a critical temperature is observed to swell immediately as vacuum assistance is applied.

N2 - The convergence of systems neuroscience and open science arouses great interest in the current brain big data era, highlighting the thinking capability of intelligent agents in handling multi-source knowledge, information and data across various levels of granularity. To realize such thinking-inspired brain computing during a brain investigation process, one of the major challenges is to find a holistic brain map that can model multi-dimensional variables of brain investigations across brain functions, experimental tasks, brain data and analytical methods synthetically. In this paper, we propose a context-enhanced graph learning method to fuse open knowledge from different sources, including: contextual information enrichment, structural knowledge fusion, and holistic graph learning. Such a method can enhance contextual learning of abstract concepts and relational learning between two concepts that have large gap from different dimensions. As a result, an extensible space, namely Thinking Space, is generated to represent holistic variables and their relations in a map, which currently contributes to the field of brain research for systematic brain computing. In the future, the Thinking Space coupled with the rapid development and spread of artificial intelligence generated content will be developed in more scenarios so as to promote global interactions of intelligence in the connected world.

N2 - G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise the most important superfamily of protein targets in current ligand discovery and drug development. GPCRs are integral membrane proteins that play key roles in various cellular signaling processes. Therefore, GPCR signaling pathways are closely associated with numerous diseases, including cancer and several neurological, immunological, and hematological disorders. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) can expedite the process of GPCR drug discovery and potentially reduce the actual cost of research and development. Increasing knowledge of biological structures, as well as improvements on computer power and algorithms, have led to unprecedented use of CADD for the discovery of novel GPCR modulators. Similarly, machine learning approaches are now widely applied in various fields of drug target research. This review briefly summarizes the application of rising CADD methodologies, as well as novel machine learning techniques, in GPCR structural studies and bioligand discovery in the past few years. Recent novel computational strategies and feasible workflows are updated, and representative cases addressing challenging issues on olfactory receptors, biased agonism, and drug-induced cardiotoxic effects are highlighted to provide insights into future GPCR drug discovery.
