abstract = {In this paper we propose modeling and analysis techniques for genetic networks that provide biologists with insight into the dynamics of such systems. Central to our modeling approach is the framework of hybrid systems and our analysis tools are derived from formal analysis of such systems. Given a set of states characterizing a property of biological interest P, we present the Multi-Affine Rectangular Partition (MARP) algorithm for the construction of a set of infeasible states I that will never reach P and the Rapidly Exploring Random Forest of Trees (RRFT) algorithm for the construction of a set of feasible states F that will reach P. These techniques are scalable to high dimensions and can incorporate uncertainty (partial knowledge of kinetic parameters and state uncertainty).We apply these methods to understand the genetic interactions involved in the phenomenon of luminescence production in the marine bacterium V. fischeri.}

abstract = {This study aims to predict the overall aerodynamic performance, unsteady forces and the tonal noise radiation from a small axial flow fan. The computation is divided into two stages: (a) the computation of the unsteady flow field at design and off-design working conditions, and (b) detailed analysis of the acoustic field. A dual-time scheme for dealing with rotor-stator or wake-struts interactions in turbomachinery environments by introducing a pseudo-time to represent the time variation of source terms and the finite volume control method are applied for the unsteady solutions involving the whole flow passages of the axial flow fan, and the pressure rise against volume flow rate is obtained and shown to be in good agreement with experimental data. The interaction of the rotor wake and the downstream struts has been simulated by investigating the effects of source distribution over the whole blades. And the tonal noise is then predicted based on Lowson’s theory. The unsteady force is divided into thrust in the rotational axis direction and drag in the rotational direction for the rotor and struts. It is demonstrated that the unsteady forces acting on the rotor and struts are produced by the interaction between them, and has a close relationship with the rotor wake structure and the strut alignment. In the rotor near wake, both the viscous and potential flow is dominant not only to aerodynamic forces but also to interaction noise. The present study shows that the higher lean angle of struts can gain about 4 dB reduction of overall sound power level compared to the smallest one.}

abstract = {This study presents four different impeller designs to compare hydrodynamic forces. Numerical simulation studies are performed via computational fluid dynamics to specify and investigate the hydraulic forces impacting the impeller of the mixed-flow blood pump with a volute. The design point of this pump is that the flow rate is 5 L/min, the rotational speed is 8000 rpm, and the manometric head is 100 mmHg. The designed impellers are placed in the same volute and simulation studies are performed with the same mesh size (17.3 million cells) of the pumps. The simulation studies have been conducted in setting 1050 kg/m3 blood density, 35 cP fluid viscosity, and SST-kω turbulence model. Additionally, this study examines the changes in hydraulic forces and hydraulic efficiency with fluid viscosity. As a result of experimental simulation studies, the highest hydraulic efficiencies of 40.87% and 39.5% are achieved in the case of the shaftless-grooveless and shafted-grooveless impeller, respectively. The maximum axial forces are obtained from the pump with the shaftless-grooveless impeller. Whereas radial forces, maximum values are calculated in the pump with the shaftless-outer groove impeller for all flow rates. Finally, the wall shear stresses, which are important for blood pump designs, are evaluated and the maximum value of 227 Pa is observed in the pump impeller with a shaftless-grooved.}

abstract = {Hysteretic damping of a material or structure loaded within its elastic region is the dissipation of mechanical energy at a rate independent of the frequency of vibration while at the same time directly proportional to the square of the displacement. Generally, reproducing this frequency-independent damping can be computationally complex and requires prior knowledge of the system’s natural frequencies or the full time history of the system’s response. In this paper, a new model and numerical procedure are proposed whereby hysteretic material damping is achieved in the time domain. The proposed procedure is developed based on modifying the viscous model through a correction factor calculated exclusively using the local response. The superiority of the proposed approach lies in its ability to capture material hysteresis without any knowledge of the eigen- or modal frequencies of the system and without knowledge of the past time history of the system’s response or the characteristics of any excitation forces. A numerical procedure is also presented for implementing the proposed model in vibration analysis. The simplicity of the approach enables its generalisation to continuous systems and to systems of multi-degrees of freedom as demonstrated herein. The proposed model is presented as a correction to the viscous damping model which makes it attractive to implement into commercial finite element package using user-defined element subroutines as demonstrated in this study.}

abstract = {Peripheral access cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is initiated with percutaneous cannulae (CTRL) and venous drainage is often impeded due to smaller vessel and cannula size. A new cannula (Smartcanula ®, SC) was developed which can change shape in situ and, therefore, may improve venous drainage. Its performance was evaluated using a 2-D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model. The Navier-Stokes equations could be simplified due to the fact that we use a steady state and a 2-dimensional system while the equation of continuity (ρ constant) was also simplified. We compared the results of the SC to the CTRL using CFDRC® (Version 6.6, CFDRC research corporation, Huntsville, USA) at two preloads (300 and 700 Pa). The SC’s mass flow rate outperformed the CTRL by 12.1% and 12.2% at a pressures of 300 and 700 Pa, respectively. At 700 Pa, a pressure gradient of 50% was measured for the CTRL and 11% for the SC. The mean velocity at the 700 Pa for the CTRL was 1.0 m.s-1 at exit while the SC showed an exit velocity of 1.3 m.s-1. Shear rates inside the cannulae were similar between the two cannulae. In conclusion, the prototype shows greater mass flow rates compared to the classic cannula; thus, it is more efficient. This is also advocated by a better pressure gradient and higher average velocities. By reducing cannula-tip surface area or increasing hole surface area, greater flow rates are achieved.Perfusion (2007) 22, 257—265.}

abstract = {Organic solvents frequently lead to substantial occupational health issues in secondary industries. This study examined the xylene diffusion process in painting workshops as a case study to develop a control of indoor air quality in manufacturing workshops. Three-dimensional simulations of xylene emission were built based on a ventilated chamber test to provide the source term for the mathematical model. An exponential relationship was established between xylene emissions rates and time. Numerical results obtained using the emissions rate model were more consistent with experimental data than those from constant emission rate. Owing to the property that is denser than air; therefore, given the coupled influence of molecular diffusion, gravity and environmental turbulence, the xylene concentration at a height of 0.75–2.5 m is high, and it could possibly exceed the Chinese standard, GBZ 2.1–2019 permissible concentration time weighted average (PC-TWA) of 50 mg/m3 in human-occupied zones. At the height of the human breathing zone (1.1 m), the aggregated concentration may even exceed the PC-TWA at 450 s by 100 times. Considering that the diffusion of xylene in a painting workshop represents heavy-gas pollutant diffusion problems, this study can be extended to predict pollutant concentration distributions in other secondary industrial workshops.}

abstract = {We investigate metabolic interactions between astrocytes and GABAergic neurons at steady states corresponding to different activity levels using a six-compartment model and a new methodology based on Bayesian statistics. Many questions about the energetics of inhibition are still waiting for definite answers, including the role of glutamine and lactate effluxed by astrocytes as precursors for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and whether metabolic coupling applies to the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Our identification and quantification of metabolic pathways describing the interaction between GABAergic neurons and astrocytes in connection with the release of GABA makes a contribution to this important problem. Lactate released by astrocytes and its neuronal uptake is found to be coupled with neuronal activity, unlike glucose consumption, suggesting that in astrocytes, the metabolism of GABA does not require increased glycolytic activity. Negligible glutamine trafficking between the two cell types at steady state questions glutamine as a precursor of GABA, not excluding glutamine cycling as a transient dynamic phenomenon, or a prominent role of GABA reuptake. Redox balance is proposed as an explanation for elevated oxidative phosphorylation and adenosine triphosphate hydrolysis in astrocytes, decoupled from energy requirements.}

The simulations proposed for physics teaching are designed for specific purposes and allow studying natural phenomena through exploration and/or modeling. In this work, we present an analysis that, based on the theoretical frame provided by the nature of science (NOS), considers some aspects of present discussions on computer simulations that should be taken into account to promote scientifically literate citizens. We examine different types of simulations used, specifically, in the teaching of physics for high school in the past few years. We also explore some of the current philosophical thoughts on scientific simulations and which of their aspects could become part of the teaching–learning process when using simulations in science teaching—for example, the role of the model in simulations, the relationship between simulations and experimentation, the validity of knowledge resulting from simulations, and the role of animation in relation to the simulation used. Discussing these aspects from the viewpoint of the NOS would provide students with an updated vision of scientific activity so that they could analyze the information they receive daily and, as members of society, take a stand accordingly.}

The objective of this paper is two-fold: first, a consistent time-integration method of the whole coupled system is developed and the robustness is shown. Second, several data transfer methods — conservative interpolation, Galerkin-based transfer, dual-Lagrange-based transfer, and Sobolev-norm-based transfer — are employed and the importance of an accurate transfer scheme is demonstrated. Numerical results obtained from simulations of an oscillating one-dimensional plate in a transonic flow and a three-dimensional wing example serve as a typical benchmark problem to show the applicability of the presented concepts and the importance on the behaviour of an aeroelastic system.}
