N2 - The political landscape in Bangladesh is complex and multifaceted, with limited exploration in relation to the rapidly growing news industry. This study aims to address this gap by analyzing 15,801 news articles, utilizing trend analysis and topic modeling. The findings reveal a consistent decline in political news coverage, with sporadic increases during parliamentary election years. The dominant focus of news topics revolves around the two major political parties, the Awami League (AL) and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), indicating the country’s two-party-centric nature of politics. Smaller political parties receive media coverage primarily when they form coalitions with major parties, further highlighting the dominance of the two major parties in political news coverage. The study also uncovers a preference for individual political figures over incidents or events in news coverage, suggesting a patron-client relationship within major political parties and a hierarchical decision-making system. In addition, the study identifies shifts in news framing during significant events, such as national elections, indicating changes in person-centric news frames, but always involving one of the two major political parties. Finally, the study highlights and raises important questions about potential political control over media and journalistic activities, stimulating discourse on journalistic freedom and political free speech.

N2 - Abstract This article addresses two modelling aspects of wind turbine aerofoil aerodyna-mics based on the solution of the Reynolds-averaged Navier—Stokes (RANS) equations. One of these is the effect of an a priori method for structured grid adaptation aimed at improving the wake resolution. The presented results emphasize that the proposed adaptation strategy greatly improves the wake resolution in the far field, whereas the wake is completely diffused by the non-adapted grid with the same number and spacing patterns of grid nodes. The proposed adaptation approach can be easily included in the structured generation process of both commercial and in-house-structured mesh generators. The other numerical aspect examined herein is the impact of particular choices for turbulence modelling on the predicted solution. This includes the comparative analysis of numerical solutions obtained by using different turbulence models, and also aims at quantifying the solution inaccuracy arising from not modelling the laminar-to-turbulent transition. It is found that the drag forces obtained by considering the flow as transitional or fully turbulent may differ by 50 per cent. All these issues are investigated using a special-purpose hyperbolic grid generator and two multi block structured finite volume RANS codes. The numerical experiments consider the flow field past a wind turbine aerofoil for which an exhaustive campaign of steady and unsteady experimental measurements was conducted. The predictive capabilities of the CFD solvers are validated by comparing experimental data and numerical predictions for selected flow regimes. The incompressible analysis and design code XFOIL is also used to support the findings of the comparative analysis of numerical RANS-based results and experimental data.

N2 - Background: Redox active metal cations, such as Cu2 +, have been related to induce amyloid plaques formation and oxidative stress, which are two of the key events in the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and others metal promoted neurodegenerative diseases. In these oxidative events, standard reduction potential (SRP) is an important property especially relevant in the reactive oxygen species formation. Objective: The SRP is not usually considered for the selection of drug candidates in anti-AD treatments. In this work, we present a computational protocol for the selection of multifunctional ligands with suitable metal chelating, pharmacokinetics, and redox properties. Methods: The filtering process is based on quantum chemical calculations and the use of in silico tools. Calculations of SRP were performed by using the M06-2X density functional and the isodesmic approach. Then, a virtual screening technique (VS) was used for similar structure search. Results: Protocol application allowed the assessment of chelating, drug likeness, and redox properties of copper ligands. Those molecules showing the best features were selected as molecular scaffolds for a VS procedure in order to obtain related compounds. After applying this process, we present a list of candidates with suitable properties to prevent the redox reactions mediated by copper(II) ion. Conclusion: The protocol incorporates SRP in the filtering stage and can be effectively used to obtain a set of potential drug candidates for AD treatments.

N2 - The ambition and proposal for data modeling of myths presented in this paper is to link contemporary technical affordances to some canonical projects developed in structural anthropology. To articulate the theoretical promise and innovation of this proposal, we present a discrete-event system specification modeling and simulation approach in order to perform a generative analysis and a dynamic visualization of selected narratives, aimed at validating and revitalizing the transformational and morphodynamic theory and methodology proposed by Claude Lévi-Strauss in his structural analysis of myth. After an analysis of Lévi-Strauss’s transformational methodology, we describe in detail how discrete-event system specification models are implemented and developed in the framework of a DEVSimPy software environment. The validation of the method involves a discrete-event system specification simulation based on the extension of discrete-event system specification models dedicated to provide a dynamic Google Earth visualization of the selected myth. Future work around the discrete-event system specification formalism in anthropology is described as well as future applications regarding the impact of computational models (discrete-event system specification formalism, Bayesian inferences, and object-oriented features) to new contemporary anthropological domains.

N2 - The original definition of P systems calls for rules to be applied in a maximally parallel fashion. However, in some cases a sequential model may be a more reasonable assumption. Here we study the computational power of different variants of sequential P systems. Initially we look at cooperative systems operating on symbol objects and without prioritized rules, but which allow membrane dissolution and bounded creation rules. We show that they are equivalent to vector addition systems and, hence, nonuniversal. When these systems are used as language acceptors, they are equivalent to communicating P systems which, in turn, are equivalent to partially blind multicounter machines. In contrast, if such cooperative systems are allowed to create an unbounded number of new membranes (i.e., with unbounded membrane creation rules) during the course of the computation, then they become universal. We then consider systems with prioritized rules operating on symbol objects. We show two types of results: there are sequential P systems that are universal and sequential P systems that are nonuniversal. In particular, both communicating and cooperative P systems are universal, even if restricted to 1-deterministic systems with one membrane. However, the reachability problem for multi-membrane catalytic P systems with prioritized rules is NP-complete and, hence, these systems are nonuniversal.

N2 - Low temperature, highly premixed compression ignition strategies have proven to produce high efficiency and low soot emissions, but struggle to reach high loads within normal operating constraints. Recent research has suggested that a mixed mode combustion strategy using a premixed main heat release followed by a mixing controlled load extension injection can retain the part-load thermal efficiency and emissions reduction potential of premixed compression ignition strategies, while enabling high load operation. However, soot emissions under this type of mixed mode combustion strategy have been shown to be problematic. This work investigates soot formation and mitigation methods using a combination of detailed engine experiments and computational fluid dynamics modeling. A premixed compression ignition combustion event was achieved using a premixed charge of gasoline and n-heptane to control combustion phasing, and a load extension injection of gasoline was added near top dead center. The experiments showed negligible engine out soot under the premixed compression ignition operating conditions (i.e. without the load extension injection). When the load extension injection was added, soot increased by several orders of magnitude. Detailed experiments were used to isolate the effects of injection timing, injection pressure, charge conditions (e.g. air–fuel ratio), and fuel type. Computational fluid dynamics modeling considering polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon chemistry up to pyrene was then used to explain the experimentally observed soot trends. As expected, the soot emission results showed a strong impact of oxygen concentration and injection pressure for injection timings near top dead center; however, as the load extension injection event was delayed beyond the end of the premixed compression ignition heat release, the soot formation decreased and became independent of oxygen concentration. At these conditions, the computational fluid dynamics modeling showed that soot formation is dependent solely on temperature. The results identify a pathway to enable premixed compression ignition load extension, while minimizing soot emissions.

N2 - Contemporary artificial intelligence and algorithmic processes address deep-seated existential challenges and modes of desire. In so doing, they produce computational systems of imagination, an “algorithmic as if” that enables the expression, transformation, and seeming overcoming of existential limitations via technological means. This article elaborates the character of the “algorithmic as if” by focusing on Deep Nostalgia, an online tool that turns personal photographs of the deceased into looped animations which smile, blink, and move, promising to overcome mortality by technologically “resurrecting the dead.” Performing a close-reading of Deep Nostalgia’s technological processes and the public discourse around its 2021 launch, the article highlights its combination of computational learning, forms of visual representation (photography, video, and animation), and distinctive realignments of temporal experience. Together, these frame the “algorithmic as if” as a magical and affective space for realizing impossible longings that are also reflexive encounters with the “limit-situation” of human mortality.

N2 - The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques enables performance predictions of bearing designs to be made when the usual operating assumptions of the Reynolds equation Jail to hold. This paper addresses the application of a full three-dimensional thermohydrodynamic CFD approach to journal bearings. The journal/shaft may extend beyond the bearing length and the rotation effect is accounted for in the thermal transport process. A circumferentially uniform shaft surface temperature is not assumed. Cavitation modelling is based on averaged lubricant/vapour properties and does not set pressures directly, allowing sub-ambient pressures to be predicted. Lubricant inlet grooves are incorporated with conservation of mass and the possibility of backflow. The modelling is validated against published experimental work on fully circumferential, single inlet and two-inlet circular bore bearings. The predicted and experimental results are in general agreement, although the predicted cyclic variation of journal surface temperature is less than the experimental value. However, an assumption in the predictions was of a non-orbiting journal. The techniques developed may, in principle, be extended to the orbiting journal case providing a dynamic cavitation model can be formulated.
