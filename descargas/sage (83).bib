abstract = {Abstract This paper presents some results obtained during the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of internal flows inside a hydraulic component, using a scaling technique applied to numerical pre- and post-processing. The main aim of the work is to demonstrate the reduction of computational work needed for a complete analysis of component behaviour over a wide range of operating conditions. This result is achieved through the adoption of a methodology aimed at giving the highest level of generality to a non-dimensional solution, thereby overcoming the two major limitations encountered in the use of CFD in fluid power design: computer resources and time. In the case study, the technique was applied to a hydraulic distributor and computations were performed with a commercial computational fluid dynamics code. The key factor of this technique is the evaluation, for a given distributor opening, of the Reynolds number of the flow in the metering region. Provided that this number is high enough to ensure that the discharge coefficient has reached its asymptotic value, the characterization of the flow by a single non-dimensional numerical run can be shown. The theoretical contents of the analysis of the re-scaling technique, which focuses on the engineering information necessary in component design, are described in detail. The bases for its subsequent application to actual cases are then outlined. Finally, a fairly close correlation between numerical results and experimental data is presented.}

abstract = {People who interact with graphs to perform arithmetic tasks typically employ quantitative features. However, they may employ the spatial metaphor under two alternative conditions: if they have been trained to apply visual arithmetic methods to traditional line and bar graphs, or if they interact with specially constructed and special-purpose computational graphics. Two experiments explored a visual arithmetic method used to train subjects to determine a mean by locating the spatial midpoint of a set of indicators (bars in a bar graph or points in a line graph). In Experiment 1 visual arithmetic subjects determined the mean of five indicators as quickly as they did the mean of two indicators; control subjects performed slower with five indicators. Both groups took more time to add the values of five indicators than to add two indicators. In Experiment 2, unlike control subjects, visual arithmetic subjects’ response times in mean trials were unaffected by changes in the y-axis scale. However, both groups were affected by the y-axis scale on addition trials. Neither group was influenced by changes in the distance between indicators. The discussion addresses the transfer of visual arithmetic training to tasks that differ from the one used during training, uses for visual arithmetic and computational graphics, and the role of parallel processing and task restructuring in visual arithmetic.}

abstract = {The friction type tensioner is an energy absorbing component in belt drive system which has hysteretic torque and nonlinear damping. In this paper, a hysteretic model is used for describing the tensioner’s operating torque versus the imposed angle, and considered into the dynamic analysis of a belt drive system. The modeling process for calculating the vibration responses of a belt drive system is presented, and two iterative methods are proposed for estimating the tensioner’s nonlinear damping in a varying excitation frequency. One timing belt drive system is taken as a case study. The system’s vibration responses, such as the oscillation angle of tensioner arm, the transmission error between pulleys and the hub load on pulley are calculated and compared with the measured values, which validate the presented methods. The influence of iterative method on the computational efficiency and iterative accuracy are both discussed. At last a modified method is presented to improve iterative efficiency. The presented technique can improve the computational efficiency with a good computational accuracy.}

abstract = {Robotic tasks (e.g., kinematics and dynamics) are computation ally expensive. The majority of these tasks must be computed in real-time to meet the high sampling rate modes of oper ations. Recently parallel processing has been used to speed up these computations. In this work, we propose a graph- based algorithm to map computational tasks onto multiple instruction-multiple data (MIMD) type of architectures. The algorithm automatically generates the task graph of a given task. Then an annealing procedure is used to allocate the gen erated subtasks to different processors, taking into account the network topology and the communication constraints. Moreover, the proposed technique is simple, flexible, and computationally viable. The efficiency of the algorithm is demonstrated by a case study with good results.}

abstract = {How robust is a healthcare system? How does a patient navigate the system and what is the cost (e.g., number of medical services required or number of times the medical provider had to be changed to get access to the required medical services) incurred from the first symptoms to getting cured? How will it fare in the wake to a sudden epidemic or a disaster? How are all of these affected by administrative decisions such as allocating/diminishing resources in various areas or centralising services? These are the questions motivating our study on a formal prototype model for a healthcare system. We propose that a healthcare system can be understood as a distributed system with independent nodes (healthcare providers) computing according to their own resources and constraints, with tasks (patient needs) being allocated between the nodes. The questions about the healthcare system become in this context questions about resource availability and distribution between the nodes. We construct in this paper an Event-B model capturing the basic functionality of a simplified healthcare system: patients with different types of medical needs being allocated to suitable medical providers, and navigating between different providers for their turn for multi-step treatments.}

Critical Thinking and Research Utilization Questionnaires were used along with the Barrier Scale. Descriptive analyses, comparisons between and within groups were performed. At the end of education, all samples exhibited positive attitudes to research and the main barrier was related to the setting. Scandinavian students reported higher critical thinking. Indonesian students perceived greater barriers on two Barrier subscales. No differences were found between the samples regarding research utilization. Significant changes over time varied among the samples except for the Norwegian sample. Indonesian students (diploma) exhibited most changes over time. Teachers must support nursing students to strengthen their critical thinking ability and develop professional competence.}

abstract = {Relatively little attention has been paid to the venous system and valves from a cardiovascular engineering perspective up to now. Given the involvement of venous valve haemodynamics in the development of deep vein thrombosis this is an area that needs more detailed investigation and close collaboration between clinicians and cardiovascular engineers. The purpose of this review article is to provide an indication of the physiological conditions that need to be included in any computational model of the venous system, based on recommendations from clinicians, and to summarize published computational models of the venous system by trying to explore their limitations and application range. A MEDLINE search was carried out on the relevant literature from 1940 until today. Several models have been developed with a specific purpose in mind to coincide with the aim of each individual study. The model complexity and laws used in each model vary significantly. There are more simplistic computational models based on electric circuit analogies, termed as lumped parameter models, which can be used to provide boundary conditions to one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) domain models, followed by 1D continuous models based on analytical equations, which allow the description of pressure wave and can be non-linear in nature. Finally, there are the more advanced 3D models, which are based on the principles of haemodynamics, and consider the compliance of the venous system and the effect that venous valves have on the cardiovascular system. In conclusion, it appears that computer modelling of the venous system can contribute greatly to our understanding of venous physiology and allow us to evaluate the haemodynamic interactions that occur in the venous system under different physiological conditions.}
