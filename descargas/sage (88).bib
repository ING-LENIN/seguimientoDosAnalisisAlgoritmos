N2 - This study presents a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to simulate the three-dimensional airflow in the trachea before and after the vascular ring surgery (VRS). The simulation was based on CT-scan images of the patients with the vascular ring diseases. The surface geometry of the tracheal airway was reconstructed using triangular mesh by the Amira software package. The unstructured tetrahedral volume meshes were generated by the ANSYS ICEM CFD software package. The airflow in the tracheal airway was solved by the ESI CFD-ACE+ software package. Numerical simulation shows that the pressure drops across the tracheal stenosis before and after the surgery were 0.1789 and 0.0967 Pa, respectively, with the inspiratory inlet velocity 0.1 m/s. Meanwhile, the improvement percentage by the surgery was 45.95%. In the expiratory phase, by contrast, the improvement percentage was 40.65%. When the inspiratory velocity reached 1 m/s, the pressure drop became 4.988~Pa and the improvement percentage was 43.32%. Simulation results further show that after treatment the pressure drop in the tracheal airway was significantly decreased, especially for low inspiratory and expiratory velocities. The CFD method can be applied to quantify the airway pressure alteration and to evaluate the treatment outcome of the vascular ring surgery under different respiratory velocities.

N2 - This study investigates pre-service computer science (CS) teachers’ perspectives on the factors affecting their programming abilities, concerns about their future professional lives, and pedagogical suggestions for effective programming teaching. The participants of the study were twenty-eight pre-service CS teachers studying at eighteen different universities in Türkiye. The data was gathered with a questionnaire consisting of open-ended questions. Results showed that inherent programming challenges, personal factors, and quality of undergraduate education affected pre-service CS teachers’ abilities in programming teaching. They were concerned about their professional lives relating to programming teaching, keeping up with technological innovations, pedagogical concerns, and teaching practice. They also suggested pedagogical approaches that could be used in programming teaching under two categories, namely basic programming teaching, and teaching principles and techniques. The study contributes to the development of programming teaching by shedding light on the current perspectives of pre-service CS teachers on programming education.

N2 - Depending on the characteristics of the cancer and the specific treatment required, each type of cancer comes with a unique set of challenges in the psychological wellbeing of women. This research work mainly focuses on Ovarian cancer since the it is one of the 5 leading cancers among women. As per the statistics of 2021, by the American Cancer Society, 21,410 women would be diagnosed with ovarian cancer and 13,770 women might die from ovarian cancer. Both physically and psychologically, ovarian cancer presents several challenges. To control the growth of the tumour, multiple treatments are required. The psychological issues in women with ovarian cancer is mainly due to “loss of femininity” that affects them while they proceed through the phases of diagnosis, treatment and recurrence. Psychological factors associated with both, having ovarian cancer and being at risk are considered in this study. In the proposed work, PHQ 9 and GAD 7 are the tools used to measure depression and anxiety among women who are undergoing treatment for ovarian cancer. The data, collected with the help of these tools, is analysed using the popular Machine Learning algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network etc. The results of Machine Learning algorithms are then compared with Mamdani and Sugeno fuzzy inference models. The Sugeno fuzzy inference system outperformed in comparison to all other models, with an accuracy of 96.2% for depression and 98.83% for anxiety, followed by Mamdani fuzzy inference system giving 94.3% accuracy for depression and 96.7% for anxiety. The performance is then compared with the linear SVM which obtained an accuracy of 91.52% for depression and 93.78% for anxiety. The analysed performance of the data using computational algorithms are compared with that of expert clinical psychologists. The severely affected women are advised to visit a psychiatrist.

N2 - Emergent phenomena—those that manifest bottom-up from the psychological characteristics, perceptions, and interactions among individuals—are a fundamental dynamic process in multilevel theory, but have been treated in a very limited way in the research literature. In particular, treatments are largely assumed (rather than observed directly), retrospective, and static. This paper describes a research paradigm designed to examine directly the dynamics of micro-meso—individual, dyad, and team—emergent phenomena. We identify, describe, and illustrate the sequence of theoretical, measurement, computational, data analytic, and systematic research activities that are necessary to operationalize and utilize the paradigm. We illustrate the paradigm development process using our research, focused on learning and team knowledge emergence, and highlight key design principles that can be applied to examine other emergent phenomena in teams. We conclude with a discussion of contributions, strengths and limitations, and generalization of the approach to other emergent phenomena in teams.

N2 - Different domains of software applications require that the project management’s development process be customized to its specific conditions and needs. One of the most widely used operation research is the development of a scientific software product. Numerous studies point to a wide gap among the various communities, processes, dynamics, etc., between the development of general software products and the development of computational scientific software products. This wide gap emphasizes the necessity for more suitable and more adjustable practices in project management and in the development of scientific software products. One of the most significant challenges in the development of scientific software is expressed in the different attitudes and expectations held by various stakeholders, in terms of the scope, objectives, and goals they envision for their software product. Although unique challenges in the development of scientific software arise at every stage of the process, we maintain that, by addressing the varying perspectives gap at the very outset of the project management process, one can reduce unwanted dynamics throughout the development process. A “project charter” is a critical formal statement that defines the scope, objectives and participants in a project in order to officially authorize the project and to ensure that everyone involved is aware of its purpose and objectives. Customization of the project charter can provide a response to the varying perspectives gap. This paper presents an approach to the generation of a customized project charter for scientific software products as an initial and essential step for the achievement of quality. We will demonstrate the implementation of the approach in one of our own scientific software development projects – a simulation software product used for the development of a fiber optic evanescent wave spectroscopy (FEWS) simulator.

N2 - We investigate a new approach for characterizing class separability based on topological measures for use with identifying flaw severity in plates. Multi-mode Lamb waves are propagated across a flat-bottom hole of varying depth. Lamb wave tomography reconstructions are first generated to locate and size the flaw at each depth. As the flaw depth increases, scattering and mode conversion effects dominate the raw time-domain signals, obscuring information about flaw severity. Pattern classification provides an alternate means for processing the ultrasonic waveforms to identify flaw severity. High-dimensional feature spaces are generated from the Lamb wave signals using the dynamic wavelet fingerprinting technique. In order to achieve high classification accuracy, an optimal feature space is required. An intelligent feature selection routine is explored here that identifies favorable class distributions in multidimensional feature spaces using computational homology theory. Betti numbers and formal classification accuracies are calculated for each feature space subset to establish a correlation between the topology of the class distribution and the corresponding classification accuracy.

N2 - Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill of 2010, a substantial body of research has focused on the development of computational tools and analytical frameworks for modeling oil spill events. Much of this work is dedicated to deepening our understanding of the interactions between oil, fragile ecosystems, and the environment, as well as the impacts of oil on human settlements which are vulnerable to spill events. These advances in oil spill modeling and associated analytics have not only increased the efficiency of spill interdiction and mitigation efforts, they have also helped to nurture proactive, versus reactive, response strategies and plans for local and regional stakeholders. The purpose of this paper is to provide a progress report on the wide range of computational tools, analytical frameworks, and emerging technologies which are necessary inputs for a complete oil spill modeling package. Specifically, we explore the use of relatively mature tools, such as dedicated spill modeling packages, geographic information systems (GIS), and remote sensing, as well emerging technologies such as aerial and aquatic drones and other in-situ sensing technologies. The integration of these technologies and the advantages associated with using a geographic lens for oil spill modeling are discussed.

N2 - Self-expanding stents made of Nitinol, a Nickel–Titanium shape memory alloy, are used in standard medical implants for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Despite the increasing success, clinical studies have reported stent failure after the deployment in the human body, thus undermining patient’s safety and life. This study aims to fill the gap of reliable assessment of the fatigue life of Nitinol stents. We propose a global computational design method for preclinical validation of Nitinol stents, which can be extended to patient-specific computations. The proposed methodology is composed of a mechanical finite element analysis and a fatigue analysis. The latter analysis is based on a novel multiaxial fatigue criterion of the Dang Van type, combining the shakedown response of the stent and the complexity of phase transformation taking place within the material. The method is implemented in the case of a carotid artery stent. The implant configuration as well as the applied cyclic loading are shown to affect material phase evolution as well as stent lifetime. The comparison with the results obtained by applying a strain-based constant-life diagram approach allows to critically discuss both fatigue criteria and to provide useful recommendations about their applicability.

N2 - The paper presents a review of existing literature in the field of coupling Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with Building Energy Simulations (BES) to better predict indoor environmental conditions and building energy implications. CFD is capable of providing a detailed analysis of airflow profile and temperature gradients in the space as well as better prediction of heat transfer involving convection and radiation. Whereas BES can provide dynamically changing boundary conditions to CFD to facilitate a precise transient analysis. Combining the two simulations provides a powerful framework to accurately predict building performance parameters. The review examines the variables exchanged between the two simulations and establishes that the Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient (CHTC) as the most important exchanged variable that can significantly improve the accuracy of energy simulations. Issues regarding the application of co-simulation mechanism are then discussed in terms of simulation discontinuities, along with strategies adopted by researchers to overcome the same. In the later sections, the review evaluates the applicability of co-simulation from the perspective of year-long building energy simulations and presents an overview of methods used in research to implement the same. Finally, the conclusions are discussed and the scope for future research in the field is presented. Practical implication: The review presents a critical analysis of essentially all major coupling strategies that can be used to perform a BES-CFD coupled analysis along with their strengths, limitations and possible application scenarios. Additionally, the problems associated with establishing the co-simulation are examined and various adopted solutions are presented along with methods implemented towards extending the practical applicability of such an analysis to encapsulate year-long simulations.

N2 - Humans make sense of the world through narratives. Therefore, adversaries often use conflict-sustaining narratives to maintain dominance and delegitimize the actions of the rivals. To better understand narratives’ role and influence in such intractable conflicts, a computational framework and methodology are introduced. The computational cognitive model and its underlying inference mechanism allow analysts to simulate and analyze narratives in relation to opposing narratives. The ability to simulate the interaction of adversarial stories with a set of micronarratives shared by members of a group opens new avenues to counter conflict-sustaining narratives. The methodology and its application to a concrete conflict scenario demonstrate how to conduct simulation-driven exploratory analysis over a complex adaptive narrative space to discern how narratives are matched to unfolding events and how they can be used to facilitate favorable change.
