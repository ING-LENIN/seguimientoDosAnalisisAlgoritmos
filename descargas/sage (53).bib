abstract = {Background According to the Committee on STEM Education, K-12 science students need access to learning experiences that promote collaboration and engagement. To fill that void, we need to develop activities that stimulate engaged learning and scaffold effective collaboration. K-12 teacher candidates see value in utilizing games for this purpose. Specifically, tabletop science games can help teachers engage students in science learning and scaffold collaboration. Aim For this study, we designed a collaborative, STEM-themed card game called MOUNTAIN RESCUE and explored its capacity to promote engaged learning and collaboration. Method Four groups of STEM campers (n = 14) in a suburban Mid-Atlantic region played MOUNTAIN RESCUE. All groups had a mix of boys and girls. Play-testers ranged from 10–13 years old. The tabletop game took approximately 30-minutes. During gameplay, players embodied unique STEM roles: physicist, chemist, structural engineer, and electrical engineer. They collaborated to solve challenges related to electricity, physics, chemistry, and engineering design. Discourse was audio-recorded throughout gameplay. Immediately after gameplay, self-report survey data were collected to assess flow and perceptions of collaborative learning. Results Findings demonstrated that the game promoted engagement and collaboration. Specifically, students had a flow-like experience and felt positively about the game’s value for collaborative learning. Utterances demonstrating active engagement and constructive thinking became more group-focused over time. Conclusion This study contributes to science education by demonstrating potential benefits of a well-designed, low-tech, science learning environment or—in other words—a tabletop game.}

abstract = {This article deals with a new approach to understand the magnetic-field-assisted nano-finishing process in which computational fluid dynamics is used to simulate the forces. A finite element method is used to evaluate the magnetic field intensity, mathematical modelling is applied to model the nano-finishing operation, and the experiments are conducted to compare the experimental results with the simulated results. A flexible polishing tool comprising a magnetorheological polishing medium is used for this process. The relative motion between the polishing medium and the workpiece surface provides the required finishing action. In the present work, a two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation of a magnetorheological polishing medium inside the workpiece fixture is performed to evaluate the axial and radial stresses developed owing to the flow of magnetically stiffened magnetorheological polishing medium. A finite element analysis is performed in order to find out the direction and the magnitude of the magnetic field. A microstructure of the mixture of magnetic and abrasive particles in the magnetorheological polishing medium is proposed in order to calculate forces acting on an active abrasive particle. Modelling of the surface finish is performed after analysing the surface roughness profile data. Further finishing experiments are conducted in order to compare the simulated surface roughness value with the experimental results and they are found to agree well.}

abstract = {The major issue in stainless steelmaking is the difficulty of oxidising carbon from molten steel without also oxidising large proportions of expensive chromium. This can, however, be achieved by reducing the partial pressure of the gaseous product of carbon oxidation, carbon monoxide, by dilution with argon. Modern stainless steelmaking is dominated by duplex processes which prepare a high carbon melt in an electric arc furnace, and then decarburise it in an argon–oxygen decarburisation (AOD) converter. In this work, the thermodynamic basis of preferential carbon oxidation by dilution of oxygen with argon is discussed, together with a review of AOD practice. The AOD process was simulated using computational thermodynamics software to illustrate the way in which it can achieve very low carbon levels in the molten steel bath without excessive co-oxidation of chromium. The slag reduction stage using ferrosilicon additions was also modelled and shown to be able to recover almost all oxidised chromium from the slag, limited only by the accompanying increase in the silicon content of the steel. The models, although simple and easy to develop, correctly predicted all trends in output variables as input parameters were changed and often matched plant data very well. The models provide a valuable learning tool for those interested in pyrometallurgical processing in general, and stainless steelmaking in particular.}

abstract = {One of the major limitations of reactivity controlled compression ignition is higher unburned hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions and lower thermal efficiency at part load operating conditions. In the present study, a combined numerical approach using a commercial three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics code CONVERGE along with artificial neural network and genetic algorithm is presented to address the above limitation. A production light-duty diesel engine is modified to run in reactivity controlled compression ignition by replacing an existing mechanical fuel injection system with a flexible electronic port fuel injection and common rail direct injection systems. The injection schedules of port fuel injection and direct injection injectors are controlled using National Instruments port and direct injection driver modules. Upon validation of combustion and emission parameters, parametric investigations are carried out to establish the effects of direct-injected diesel fuel timing start of injection (SOI), premixed fuel ratio and intake charge temperature on the engine performance and emissions in reactivity controlled compression ignition. The results obtained show that the start of injection timing and intake charge temperature significantly influence combustion phasing, while the premixed fuel ratio controls mixture reactivity and combustion quality. By utilizing the data generated with the validated computational fluid dynamics models, the artificial neural network models are trained to predict the engine exhaust emissions and efficiency. The artificial neural network models for gross indicated efficiency and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) are then coupled with genetic algorithm to maximize gross indicated efficiency while keeping the NOx and soot emissions within Euro VI emission limits. By optimizing the start of injection timing, premixed fuel ratio and intake charge temperature simultaneously using the artificial neural network models coupled with genetic algorithm, 19% improvement in gross indicated efficiency, 60% and 64% reduction in hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions, respectively, are obtained in reactivity controlled compression ignition compared to the baseline case.}

abstract = {Symbolic computational dynamic solvers are currently under development in order to provide new and powerful tools for modelling nonlinear dynamical systems. Such solvers consist of two parts; the core solver, which comprises an approximate analytical method based on perturbation, averaging, or harmonic balance, and a specialised term-tracker. A term-tracking approach has been introduced to provide a powerful new feature into computational approximate analytical solutions by highlighting the many mathematical connections that exist, but which are invariably lost through processing, between the physical model of the system, the solution procedure itself, and the final result which is usually expressed in equation form. This is achieved by a highly robust process of term-tracking, recording, and identification of all the symbolic mathematical information within the problem. In this paper, the novel source and evolution encoding method is introduced for the first time and an implementation in Mathematica is described through the development of a specialised algorithm.}

abstract = {Social information such as observing others can improve performance in decision making. In particular, social information has been shown to be useful when finding the best solution on one’s own is difficult, costly, or dangerous. However, past research suggests that when making decisions people do not always consider other people’s behaviour when it is at odds with their own experiences. Furthermore, the cognitive processes guiding the integration of social information with individual experiences are still under debate. Here, we conducted two experiments to test whether information about other persons’ behaviour influenced people’s decisions in a classification task. Furthermore, we examined how social information is integrated with individual learning experiences by testing different computational models. Our results show that social information had a small but reliable influence on people’s classifications. The best computational model suggests that in categorization people first make up their own mind based on the non-social information, which is then updated by the social information.}

abstract = {Visual aesthetics play a pivotal role in attracting and retaining customers in service environments. Building on theories of environmental psychology, this study introduces a novel and comprehensive aesthetic measure for evaluating servicescape design, which is called as the “visual aesthetic quotient” (VAQ). This measure is presented as the ratio of the dimensions of order and complexity in servicescape’s visual design, and it aims to provide an objective and holistic approach of servicescape design evaluation. In addition, we introduce and validate a pioneering method for quantifying order and complexity objectively using algorithmic models applied to servicescape images. We investigated and established the influence of the VAQ on the perceived attractiveness of servicescapes, developing its role further in this context. The entire approach was comprehensively and rigorously examined using four studies (social media analytics, eye-tracking, a field experiment, and an experimental design), contributing to conceptual advancement and empirical testing. This study provides a novel, computational, objective, and holistic aesthetic measure for effective servicescape design management by validating computational aesthetic measures and establishing their role in influencing servicescape attractiveness; testing the mediation of processing fluency and pleasure; and examining the moderating effects of service context.}

abstract = {Background Restrictive eating behaviors, widespread in humans and animals, are often conceptualized as maladaptive, but may serve adaptive purposes under specific circumstances. Aim To investigate the adaptive potential of restrictive eating behaviors. Methods Computational models explored the relationship between food availability, basal metabolic rate, and restrictive eating behaviors. The evolutionary conservation of genes associated with both basal metabolic rate and restrictive eating behaviors was evaluated. Results The propensity to engage in restrictive eating behaviors protected against negative energy balances at times of food volatility, implying ecological fitness potential. A high degree of conservation across species was observed in retrieved genes, implying selective evolutionary constraints. Conclusion Restrictive eating behaviors may represent a maladaptive outcome of evolutionary constraints on protective metabolic mechanisms. The higher prevalence of restrictive eating in women could stem from a greater reliance on protective strategies, highlighting the need for further exploration of sex-specific genetic and environmental interactions.}

The development of the model helps engineering students better understand the combined effects of chemical reactions, species transport, flow patterns and temperature distributions in the SI engine.
