abstract = {Similar to prior cycles of newsroom specialization, news organizations must integrate the expertise of data journalists. Based upon 18 in-depth interviews with data journalism leaders within American newspapers, this study examines how newsrooms are restructuring to accommodate data news work. More specifically, the research identifies four “critical junctures” by which newspapers expand data journalism operations. The interviews establish that expanding a paper’s commitment to data journalism requires reorganizing the newsroom with new layers of structural complexity.}

abstract = {Determining and understanding the performance characteristics of marine propellers by experiments is quite a complex and costly task. Numerical predictions using computational fluid dynamics simulations could be a valuable alternative provided that the laminar-to-turbulent transition flow effects are fundamentally understood with the suitable numerical models developed. Experience suggests that the use of classical turbulent flow models may lead to high discrepancies especially at low rotational speeds where the effects of fluid flow transition from the laminar to the turbulent state may influence the predicted propeller’s performance. This article proposes a complete and detailed procedure for the computational fluid dynamics simulation of non-cavitating flow over marine propellers using the “k–kl–ω” transition-sensitive turbulence model. Results are evaluated by “ANSYS FLUENT 16” for the “INSEAN E779A” propeller. Comparisons against the fully turbulent standard “k–ε” model and against experiments show improved agreement in way of flow transition zones at lower rotational speeds, that is, at low Reynolds numbers.}

abstract = {Marr proposed that human vision constructs “a true description of what is there”. He argued that to understand human vision one must discover the features of the world it recovers and the constraints it uses in the process. Bayesian decision theory (BDT) is used in modern vision research as a probabilistic framework for understanding human vision along the lines laid out by Marr. Marr’s contribution to vision research is substantial and justly influential. We propose, however, that evolution by natural selection does not, in general, favor perceptions that are true descriptions of the objective world. Instead, research with evolutionary games shows that perceptual systems tuned solely to fitness routinely outcompete those tuned to truth. Fitness functions depend not just on the true state of the world, but also on the organism, its state, and the type of action. Thus, fitness and truth are distinct. Natural selection depends only on expected fitness. It shapes perceptual systems to guide fitter behavior, not to estimate truth. To study perception in an evolutionary context, we introduce the framework of Computational Evolutionary Perception (CEP). We show that CEP subsumes BDT, and reinterprets BDT as evaluating expected fitness rather than estimating truth.}

abstract = {Multiple myeloma (MM)-induced bone disease is mortal for most MM patients. Bisphosphonates are first-line treatment for MM-induced bone disease, since it can inhibit osteoclast activity and the resultant bone resorption by suppressing the differentiation of osteoclast precursors into mature osteoclasts, promoting osteoclast apoptosis and disrupting osteoclast function. However, it is still unclear whether bisphosphonates have an anti-tumour effect. In our previous work, a computational model was built to simulate the pathology of MM-induced bone disease. This paper extends this proposed computational model to investigate the efficacy of bisphosphonates treatment and then clear the controversy of this therapy. The extended model is validated through the good agreement between simulation results and experimental data. The simulation results suggest that bisphosphonates indeed have an anti-tumour effect.}

abstract = {This paper describes the use of computational fluid dynamics in teaching graduate students who were in a four‐year B. Tech program. Many of these students did not have a good background in mathematics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and programming; however, most of them were good at computer‐aided design in ProE and were very interested in learning computational fluid dynamics as a design tool in industries. Solidworks flow simulator was chosen as the computational fluid dynamics software to teach students the entire computational fluid dynamics process in a single integrated software environment. Based on projects, computational fluid dynamics numerical methods and fundamentals of heat transfer and fluid flow were introduced to help students understand the computational fluid dynamics process, interpret, and validate simulation results. The computational fluid dynamics simulation of an orifice meter is given as the basic example for the students. Orifice meters are the most common equipment used for measuring fluid flow because of their simple mechanical structure, versatility, and low cost. In this paper, computational fluid dynamics simulation has been used to predict the orifice flow with better accuracy. Computational fluid dynamics simulations have been performed using solidworks flow simulator and validated with the data available in published literature. A new system has been proposed to accurately measure the flow using orifice metering systems.}

abstract = {The effects of hydrogen addition to internal combustion engines operated by natural gas/methane has been widely demonstrated experimentally in the literature. Already small hydrogen contents in the fuel show promising benefits with respect to increased engine efficiency, lower CO2 emissions, extended lean operating limits and a higher exhaust gas recirculation tolerance while maintaining the knock resistance of methane. In this article, the influence of hydrogen addition to methane on a spark ignited single cylinder engine is investigated. This article proposes a modelling approach to consider hydrogen addition within three-dimensional reactive computational fluid dynamics in order to establish a framework to gain further insights into the involved processes. Experiments have been performed on a single-cylinder spark-ignition engine situated at a test bed and cater as reference data for validating the proposed reactive computational fluid dynamics modelling approach based around the G-Equation combustion model. Within the course of the first part, crucial aspects relevant to the modelling of the mean engine cycle are highlighted. In this article, a simplified early combustion phase model which considers the transition towards a fully developed turbulent flame following ignition is introduced, along with a second submodel considering combined effects of the walls. The sensitivity of the combustion process towards the modelling approach is presented. The submodels were calibrated for a reference operating point, and a sweep in hydrogen content in the fuel as well as stoichiometric and lean operation has been considered. It is shown that the flame speed coefficient A appearing in the used turbulent flame speed closure, weighting the influence of the turbulent fluctuating speed , has to be adjusted for different hydrogen contents. The introduced submodels allowed for significant improvement of the in-cylinder pressure and heat release rate evolution throughout all considered operating conditions.}

abstract = {This article aims to present a two-dimensional parametric analysis of a modified Savonius wind turbine using computational fluid dynamics. The effects of three independent parameters of the rotor, namely, shape factor, overlap ratio, and tip speed ratio on turbine performance were studied and then optimized for maximum coefficient of performance using response surface methodology. The rotor performance was analyzed over specific domains of the parameters under study, and three-variable Box-Behnken design was used for design of experiment. The specific parametric combinations as per design of experiment were simulated using ANSYS Fluent®, and the response variable, coefficient of performance (Cp), was calculated. The sliding mesh model was utilized, and the flow was simulated using Shear Stress Transport (SST) k − ω model. The model was validated using past experimental results and found to predict parametric effects accurately. Minitab® and ReliaSoft DOE++® were used to develop regression equation and find the optimum combination of parameters for coefficient of performance over the specified parametric domains using response surface methodology.}

Do you follow the step-by-step tutorial, or do you dismiss it and tinker with the interface? Previous studies show that designing for both types of users yields a more gender-inclusive design. This paper explores the question: if those studies were based on participants born several technology-generations earlier, does this research need an update? Children now have greater access to smartphones and STEM outreach opportunities than before, which may have shifted girls’ technology learning preferences. This research found that most studies about gender and tinkering were conducted before 2006, revealing a research gap about younger generations. Future work could explore whether preferences to learn by process or by tinkering are still disproportionately represented in different genders. This work has implications for how human factors professionals design gender-inclusive products and training.}

abstract = {Background Nasal adhesions (NAs) are a known complication of nasal airway surgery. Even minor NAs can lead to significant postoperative nasal airway obstruction (NAO). Division of such NAs often provides much greater relief than anticipated. Objective We examine the impact of NAs at various anatomical sites on nasal airflow and mucosal cooling using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and multiple test subjects. Methods CT scans of healthy adult subjects were used to construct three-dimensional nasal airway computational models. A single virtual 2.5 mm diameter NA was placed at one of five sites commonly seen following NAO surgery within each nasal cavity bilaterally, resulting in 10 NA models and 1 NA-free control for each subject. CFD analysis was performed on each NA model and compared with the subject’s NA-free control model. Results 4 subjects were recruited to create 44 computational models. The NAs caused the airflow streamlines to separate, leading to a statistically significant increase in mucosal temperature immediately downstream to the NAs (wake region). Changes in the mucosal temperature in the wake region of the NAs were most prominent in anteriorly located NAs with a mean increase of 1.62 °C for the anterior inferior turbinate NAs (P < .001) and 0.63 °C for the internal valve NAs (P < .001). Conclusion NAs result in marked disruption to airflow patterns and reduced mucosal cooling on critical surfaces, particularly in the wake region. Reduced wake region mucosal cooling may be a contributing factor to the exaggerated perception of nasal obstruction experienced by patients with NAs.}
