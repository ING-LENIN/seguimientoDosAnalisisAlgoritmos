abstract = {We investigate a new approach for characterizing class separability based on topological measures for use with identifying flaw severity in plates. Multi-mode Lamb waves are propagated across a flat-bottom hole of varying depth. Lamb wave tomography reconstructions are first generated to locate and size the flaw at each depth. As the flaw depth increases, scattering and mode conversion effects dominate the raw time-domain signals, obscuring information about flaw severity. Pattern classification provides an alternate means for processing the ultrasonic waveforms to identify flaw severity. High-dimensional feature spaces are generated from the Lamb wave signals using the dynamic wavelet fingerprinting technique. In order to achieve high classification accuracy, an optimal feature space is required. An intelligent feature selection routine is explored here that identifies favorable class distributions in multidimensional feature spaces using computational homology theory. Betti numbers and formal classification accuracies are calculated for each feature space subset to establish a correlation between the topology of the class distribution and the corresponding classification accuracy.}

abstract = {Hybrid-driven underwater glider is a new kind of unmanned platform for water quality monitoring. It has advantages such as high controllability and maneuverability, low cost, easy operation, and ability to carry multiple sensors. This article develops a hybrid-driven underwater glider, PETRELII, and integrates a water quality monitoring sensor. Considering stability and economy, an optimal layout scheme is selected from four candidates by simulation using computational fluid dynamics method. Trials were carried out in Danjiangkou Reservoir—important headwaters of the Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project. In the trials, a monitoring strategy with polygonal mixed-motion was adopted to make full use of the advantages of the unmanned platform. The measuring data, including temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, turbidity, chlorophyll, and ammonia nitrogen, are obtained. These data validate the practicability of the theoretical layout obtained using computational fluid dynamics method and the practical performance of PETRELII with sensor.}

Calculations using density functional theory methods show that the lowest energy structures prefer protonation of the secondary amine. Formation of hydrogen bonds between the primary and secondary amine, and the secondary amine and carboxylic oxygen further stabilize the lowest energy structure. The infrared spectrum of the lowest energy structure originating with harmonic density functional theory has features that generally match the positions of the experimental spectra; however, the overall agreement with the experimental spectrum is poor. Molecular dynamics calculations were used to generate a gas-phase infrared spectrum. With these calculations a reasonable match with the experimental spectrum, especially in the high-energy region, was obtained.

A numerical and an analytical method are developed for the computation of mode shapes, natural frequencies and modal equations of continuous structures using the method of separation of variables. Time domain techniques are programmed in modular functions for structural analysis. The functions constitute a set of tools of the Structural Analysis Toolbox (SAT-Lab), developed recently for teaching modelling, analysis and design of structures and mechanical systems. Application examples of the computational tools are presented.}

abstract = {Objective SARS-CoV-2 coinfection with Streptococcus pyogenes and S pneumoniae increases disease severity, thus deserving more in-depth understanding. Methods The potential of garlic extract against the bacteria has been theoretically examined and extended to synergic predictions on SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron variants. Results Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry characterized five main components in the extract: benzeneacetaldehyde (A1; 5.65%), diallyl disulfide (A2; 19.27%), 1-allyl-3-methyltrisulfane (A3; 21.30%), methyl salicylate (A4; 7.49%), and diallyl trisulfide (A5; 39.26%). Bioassay-based inhibition zones were 8 ± 2 mm, and MIC values 64 mg·mL−1 (S pneumoniae) and 128 mg·mL−1 (S pyogenes). Density functional theory suggested the organosulfur components as the most promising inhibitors with electrophilic sites at their sulfur atoms. Molecular docking simulation agreed with their potential against S pneumoniae/S pyogenes luxS proteins and Delta/Omicron SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins, given by all docking score values being <−13 kcal·mol−1. QSARIS and ADMET predicted their bio- and pharma-favored properties. Conclusion The consistency of a variety of computational outputs justifies the dietary–supplemental potential of garlic essential oil based on its organosulfur ingredients.}

abstract = {The paper describes a computational model that we have implemented in an experimental dialogue system (DS). Communication in a natural language between two participants A and B is considered, where A has a communicative goal that his/her partner B will make a decision to perform an action D. A argues the usefulness, pleasantness, etc. of D (including its consequences), in order to guide B’s reasoning in a desirable direction. A computational model of argumentation is developed, which includes reasoning. Our model is based on the studies in the common-sense conception of how the human mind works in such situations. Theoretical considerations are followed by an analysis of Estonian spoken human–human dialogues. First, calls of clients to travel agencies are studied where a travel agent could use various arguments in order to persuade a client to book a trip. The analysis demonstrates that clients are primarily looking for information; argumentation occurs in a small number of dialogues. Secondly, calls of sales clerks of an educational company to different organisations are analysed where training courses are offered. The sales clerks, unlike the travel agents, try to persuade clients, stressing the usefulness of a course. Finally, face-to-face conversations are studied where one participant is arguing for an action by the partner. The corpus analysis shows that our model covers simple situations occurred in actual dialogues. Therefore, we have chosen a limited application of the model in a DS – communication trainer. The computer can optionally perform A’s or B’s role and the interaction with the user in Estonian follows norms and rules of human–human communication.}
