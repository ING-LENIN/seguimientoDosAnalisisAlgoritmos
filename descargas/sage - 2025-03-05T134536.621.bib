abstract = {This paper presents the results of comparison of experimental and CFD studies of slug flow in a vertical 90° bend using validated models. For the experimental part, Electrical Capacitance Tomography (ECT), Wire Mesh Tomography (WMS), and high-speed videos were used to monitor an air-silicone oil mixture flowing in a vertical 90o bend. The ECT probes were mounted before the bend whilst the WMS was positioned either immediately upstream or immediately downstream of the bend. The downstream pipe was maintained horizontal whilst the upstream pipe was maintained vertical. The bend (R/D = 2.3) was made of transparent acrylic resin. Parallel to the experiments, simulations were carried out for same experiment set-up using the commercial software package Star-CD and Star-CCM+. The condition was simulated with the Volume of Fluid (VOF) model. The simulation predictions were validated against the experimental data. A reasonably good agreement was observed for the results of the experiment and CFD.}

abstract = {Purpose Drawing on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), this sequential mixed-method study explored L2 learners’ challenges in seeking corrective feedback in an AI-assisted educational environment. Design/Approach/Methods The data was collected from 45 university students in a Computer Science program who were encouraged to seek corrective feedback from ChatGPT for their argumentative writing report. Self-reflection data were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. Findings Findings suggested that 45.9% of the AI-generated feedback was rejected by students, with a higher rejection rate observed for content-focused feedback (58.7%) compared to form-focused feedback (41.3%). AI-generated content-focused feedback was rejected due to misalignments between expected and received feedback, anticipated high workload to respond, mismatch between feedback from AI and external references, and impeding conditions for students to engage with the feedback. Meanwhile, the rejection of form-focused feedback was largely associated with the high level of expected effort. Originality/Value This study is one of the few existing studies on the L2 learners’ challenges in seeking corrective feedback from generative AI systems. Notably, the study differentiates between form-focused and content-focused feedback and identifies the distinct challenges and learning opportunities that impact students’ rejection of AI feedback.}

The approach has transformed itself from an academic inspired thinking about computing media to a more flexible model of design heuristics and search algorithms that finally start to produce new hybrid design workflows in the industry while also swimming against the industry trend of super-integration software. Only if computing is not exclusively defined through architectural design intent or purely computing logic, does computational design explore new design thinking.}

abstract = {Osteosynthesis for canine long bones is a complex process requiring knowledge of biology, surgical techniques and (bio)mechanical principles. Subject-specific finite element analysis constitutes a promising tool to evaluate the effect of surgical intervention on the global properties of a bone–implant construct, but suffers from a lack of validation. In this study, the biomechanical behavior of 10 canine humeri was compared before and after creation of a 10 mm bone defect stabilized with an eight-hole locking compression plate (Synthes®) and two locking screws on each fragment. The response under compression of both intact and plated samples was measured experimentally and reproduced with a finite element model. The experimental stiffness ratio between plated and intact bone was equal to 0.39 ± 0.06. A subject-specific finite element analysis including density-dependent elasto-plastic material properties for canine bone and automatic generation of orthopedic implants was then conducted to recover these experimental results. The stiffness of intact and plated samples could be predicted, with no significant differences with experimental data. The simulated stiffness ratio between plated and intact canine bone was equal to 0.43 ± 0.03. This study constitutes a first step toward the building of a virtual database of pre-computed cases, aiming at helping the veterinary surgeons to make decisions regarding the most suited orthopedic solution for a given dog and a given fracture.}

abstract = {Drawing upon the growing datafication of contemporary schooling, our purpose in this article is to use topological thinking as an analytical device to better understand the professionals and practices within emergent data infrastructures. We address this by attending to an influential national (and subnational) data infrastructure of school monitoring in the United States, managed by the federal Department of Education, known as EDFacts. Informed by policy documents relating to EDFacts, as well as by various related software platforms and portals, we explore the whom and how of datafication, and expose the increasing presence and influence of otherwise ‘hidden’ technology mediators, or ‘shadow professionals’. In particular, we argue that the increasing dependency of EDFacts on data has necessitated the introduction of new professional roles associated with optimising the flow of data, and thus stabilising and normalising the topological space of the infrastructure. We conclude by suggesting that EDFacts encourages teaching professionals and shadow professionals alike to engage in acts of data submission; that is, providing data to EDFacts and, at the same time, positioning themselves as wholly responsive to the infrastructure and its datafied renderings of schooling.}

abstract = {Game-Based Learning (GBL) and its subset, Board Game-Based Learning (bGBL), are dynamic pedagogical approaches leveraging the immersive power of games to enrich the learning experience. bGBL is distinguished by its tactile and social dimensions, fostering interactive exploration, collaboration, and strategic thinking; however, its adoption is limited due to lack of preparation by teachers and educators and of pedagogical and instructional frameworks in scientific literature. Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have the potential to automate or assist instructional design, but carry significant open questions, including bias, lack of context sensitivity, privacy issues, and limited evidence. This study investigates ChatGPT as a tool for selecting board games for educational purposes, testing its reliability, accuracy, and context-sensitivity through comparison with human experts evaluation. Results show high internal consistency, whereas correlation analyses reveal moderate to high agreement with expert ratings. Contextual factors are shown to influence rankings, emphasizing the need to better understand both bGBL expert decision-making processes and AI limitations. This research provides a novel approach to bGBL, provides empirical evidence of the benefits of integrating AI into instructional design, and highlights current challenges and limitations in both AI and bGBL theory, paving the way for more effective and personalized educational experiences.}

We approach the subject by answering three open problems touching on: firstly differing halting time considerations for machines with multiple as opposed to single heads, secondly space requirements, and lastly limit rules. We: 1) use admissibility theory, -codes and -reflection properties in the constructible hierarchy to classify the halting times of ITTMs with multiple independent heads; the same for Ordinal Turing Machines which have On length tapes; 2) determine which admissible lengths of tapes for transfinite time machines with long tapes allow the machine to address each of their cells – a question raised by B. Rin; 3) characterise exactly the strength and behaviour of transfinitely acting Blum–Shub–Smale machines using a Liminf rule on their registers – thereby establishing there is a universal such machine. This is in contradistinction to the machine using a ‘continuity’ rule which fails to be universal.}
