N2 - Motivated by the change of effective electrical properties grain or phase boundaries, a computational multiscale framework for continua with interfaces at the microscale is proposed. Cohesive-type interfaces are considered at the microscale, such that displacement and electrical potential jumps are accounted for. The governing equations for materials with interfaces under mechanical and electrical loads are provided. Based on these, a computational multiscale formulation is proposed. The coupling between the electrical and mechanical subproblem is established by the constitutive equations at the material interface. In order to investigate deformation-induced property changes at the microscale, the evolution of interface damage is elaborated. The proposed multiscale framework is further examined through various representative boundary value problems so as to identify its key properties.

N2 - Abstract Underbonnet simulations are proving to be crucially important within a vehicle development programme, reducing test work and time-to-market. While computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations of steady forced flows have been demonstrated to be reliable, studies of transient convective flows in engine compartments are not yet carried out owing to high computing demands and lack of validated work. The present work assesses the practical feasibility of applying the CFD tool at the initial stage of a vehicle development programme for investigating the thermally driven flow in an engine bay under thermal soak. A computation procedure that enables pseudo time-marching CFD simulations to be performed with significantly reduced central processing unit (CPU) time usage is proposed. The methodology was initially tested on simple geometries and then implemented for investigating a simplified half-scale underbonnet compartment. The numerical results are compared with experimental data taken with thermocouples and with particle image velocimetry (PIV). The novel computation methodology is successful in efficiently providing detailed and time-accurate time-dependent thermal and flow predictions. Its application will extend the use of the CFD tool for transient investigations, enabling improvements to the component packaging of engine bays and the refinement of thermal management strategies with reduced need for in-territory testing.

N2 - Genome-wide arrayed CRISPR screening is a powerful method for drug target identification as it enables exploration of the effect of individual gene perturbations using diverse highly multiplexed functional and phenotypic assays. Using high-content imaging, we can measure changes in biomarker expression, intracellular localization, and cell morphology. Here we present the computational pipeline we have developed to support the analysis and interpretation of arrayed CRISPR screens. This includes evaluating the quality of guide RNA libraries, performing image analysis, evaluating assay results quality, data processing, hit identification, ranking, visualization, and biological interpretation.

N2 - A computational approach is used to find new solitary solutions of some nonlinear partial differential equations of higher order. The usual starting point is a special transformation converting the equation under consideration in its two variables x and t into a nonlinear ordinary differential equation in the single variable ξ. When we consider the method of hyperbolic functions, new distinctive classes of solutions of physical relevance result. The new feature of this paper is the fact that we are able to calculate distinctive classes of solitary solutions which cannot be found in the literature. In other words using this method the solution manifold is augmented by further classes of solution functions. Simultaneously we stress the necessity of such sophisticated methods since a general theory of nonlinear partial differential equations does not exist. Otherwise this paper is a natural completion of our recent results using alternative approaches for calculating soliton-like solutions.

N2 - Replication is a critical element of the scientific process. This article is an effort to contribute to the slowly growing literature concerning the replication of agent-based computational models. We present a replication of Kollman, Miller, and Page’s model of Tiebout sorting. In that model, individual agents with heterogeneous preferences for government policies select among jurisdictions that offer the most satisfactory package of government services. This project makes three contributions to the literature. First, our successful replication provides the research community with a modernized version of that seminal model. Second, we confirm that earlier results with respect to the single jurisdiction setting are highly robust with respect to voter preferences, while the results for multiple jurisdiction settings are more sensitive. Finally, we demonstrate a technique for conducting sensitivity analyses that leverages a high-dimensional experimental design.

N2 - A sample-methods scales technique, analogous to Thomdike’s procedure for rating handwriting, was used to determine readability levels of eight randomly arrayed paragraphs selected from children’s literature covering the range from grades 1 through 6. Readability levels were arrived at by having judges match the randomly arrayed paragraphs either to a scale constructed for the study from paragraphs taken from children’s literature or to a scale of paragraphs taken from Spache’s Diagnostic Reading Scales. Validity of the technique was established by the chi-square finding that judged versus computed readability levels of the randomly arrayed paragraphs were not significantly different. Moreover, the average readability estimates for the 32 judges deviated less than an average of 1.0 grade levels from their computed readability levels. Comparisons with other simplified readability procedures revealed the technique was more valid than McLaughlin’s computational procedure and as valid as Fry’s graphed estimate for determining readability, but quicker, requiring approximately only two minutes per paragraph to estimate readability level. The paper concludes with discussion of a rationale for the technique’s effectiveness.

N2 - This study illuminates the varied emotional mechanisms underlying consumer response to ads paired with emotionally congruent versus incongruent content in different placement positions. This work expands the media planning literature that has narrowly focused on thematic (in)congruency. Focusing on music videos, Study 1 empirically tests the affect regulation effect on consumer response to ads paired with emotionally incongruent music videos and the affect priming effect in congruent pairings. Furthermore, this study incorporates affective computing algorithms to pair ads with music videos based on emotional (in)congruency to advance the emerging field of computational advertising. The results from two experimental studies demonstrate that consumers prefer the emotional flow from a negative to a positive state when the ad and media context are emotionally incongruent. In the emotional congruency condition, regardless of ad position, the positively valenced ad produces more favorable responses. Study 2 further illuminates the boundary conditions of emotional (in)congruency and ad valence, suggesting that consumers’ preference for positively valenced ads in the affect regulation and affect priming processes is more prominent when consumers are less involved. When involvement level is high, negative ads are rated as more persuasive than positive ones. Involvement level also reduces ad skipping, especially when the ad and the media program are emotionally incongruent.
