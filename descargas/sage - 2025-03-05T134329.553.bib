N2 - In the fields of architecture and urban design, there has always been a delay in the impact of industrial revolution technologies, and in the case of less industrialised countries, the delay has been even bigger. This article starts with a review of the history of computer-aided architectural design in Brazil and then describes the state of the field in some Latin American countries. Finally, we discuss the ‘ideal computer curriculum’ for architects in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

N2 - One feature that characterizes the organization and delivery of health care is its inherent complexity. All too often, with so much information and so many activities involved, it is difficult for decision-makers to determine in an objective fashion an appropriate course of action. It would appear that a holistic rather than a reductionist approach would be advantageous. The aim of this paper is to review how formal systems thinking can aid decision-making in complex situations. Consideration is given as to how the use of a number of systems modelling methodologies can help in gaining an understanding of a complex decision situation. This in turn can enhance the possibility of a decision being made in a more rational, explicit and transparent fashion. The arguments and approaches are illustrated using examples taken from the public health arena.

N2 - A conceptual model of the human haptic system in relation to object identification is presented. The model encompasses major architectural elements including representations of haptically accessible object properties and exploratory procedures (EPs)—dedicated movement patterns that are specialized to extract particular properties. These architectural units are related in processing-specific ways. Properties are associated with exploratory procedures in keeping with the extent to which a given procedure delivers information about a given property. The EPs are associated with one another in keeping with their compatibility, as determined by parameters of motor execution and interactions with the object and the workspace. The resulting architecture is treated as a system of constraints which guide the exploration of an object during the course of identification. The selection of the next step in a sequence of exploration requires that constraints be optimally satisfied. A network approach to constraint satisfaction is implemented and shown to account for a number of previous empirical results concerning the time course of exploration, object classification speed, and incidental learning about object properties. This system has potential applications for robotic haptic exploration.

N2 - With the continuous development of physical education technology, more modern technologies and diversified teaching concepts are being introduced into football teaching. In response to the issue of interactive football teaching puzzle games, this study designs an interactive technology that integrates Virtual Reality. A technical framework containing multiple information processing modules is constructed, and the Two Stream algorithm is used as the main body of the network framework. Action information collection and analysis are utilized to generate interactive instructions. In the analysis of training speed, the loss value of the research method decreased rapidly and reached its lowest value at the 58th iteration; in the cache data generation test, the research method did not exceed 376Mb of cache data at the 12th minute of operation. When analyzing the accuracy of interactive action recognition, the research method achieved the highest accuracy of around 0.87 in open outdoor and indoor scenes when the action duration reached 1500 ms. The research method has higher interaction quality and efficiency, which can provide technical support for information-based physical education teaching and game interaction, and provide more diversified technical means for football teaching.

N2 - Comminution and classification are the two major unit operations involved in the processing of pure minerals from its ore rocks. In the current paper, an assessment is made on different numerical models used for the prediction of fluid and solid flow properties in tumbling mill, hydrocyclone and dense medium cyclone (DMC). A detailed discussion on the selection of suitable turbulence and multiphase models for the accurate prediction of flow field in hydrocyclone is made by comparing the predictions among and against experimental data. The additional requirements for accurate performance predictions at high feed solid content is elaborated. The drawbacks of DPM model and the usage of CFD-DEM coupling technique to predict the coal partition curve in DMC’s has been elucidated. The discrepancies between DEM, CFD, one way and two way coupled CFD-DEM predicted mean flow field and particle dynamics against experimental measurements in tumbling mills also made in detail.

N2 - Background: The most important hallmark in the neuropathology of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the formation of amyloid-β (Aβ) fibrils due to the misfolding/aggregation of the Aβ peptide. Preventing or reverting the aggregation process has been an active area of research. Naturally occurring products are a potential source of molecules that may be able to inhibit Aβ42 peptide aggregation. Recently, we and others reported the anti-aggregating properties of curcumin and some of its derivatives in vitro, presenting an important therapeutic avenue by enhancing these properties. Objective: To computationally assess the interaction between Aβ peptide and a set of curcumin derivatives previously explored in experimental assays. Methods: The interactions of ten ligands with Aβ monomers were studied by combining molecular dynamics and molecular docking simulations. We present the in silico evaluation of the interaction between these derivatives and the Aβ42 peptide, both in the monomeric and fibril forms. Results: The results show that a single substitution in curcumin could significantly enhance the interaction between the derivatives and the Aβ42 monomers when compared to a double substitution. In addition, the molecular docking simulations showed that the interaction between the curcumin derivatives and the Aβ42 monomers occur in a region critical for peptide aggregation. Conclusion: Results showed that a single substitution in curcumin improved the interaction of the ligands with the Aβ monomer more so than a double substitution. Our molecular docking studies thus provide important insights for further developing/validating novel curcumin-derived molecules with high therapeutic potential for AD.

N2 - Through the recent technological developments within the fourth industrial revolution, artificial intelligence (AI) studies have had a huge impact on various disciplines such as social sciences, information communication technologies (ICTs), architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC). Regarding decision-making and forecasting systems in particular, AI and machine learning (ML) technologies have provided an opportunity to improve the mutual relationships between machines and humans. When the connection between ML and architecture is considered, it is possible to claim that there is no parallel acceleration as in other disciplines. In this study, and considering the latest breakthroughs, we focus on revealing what ML and architecture have in common. Our focal point is to reveal common points by classifying and analyzing current literature through describing the potential of ML in architecture. Studies conducted using ML techniques and subsets of AI technologies were used in this paper, and the resulting data were interpreted using the bibliometric analysis method. In order to discuss the state-of-the-art research articles which have been published between 2014 and 2020, main subjects, subsets, and keywords were refined through the search engines. The statistical figures were demonstrated as huge datasets, and the results were clearly delineated through Sankey diagrams. Thanks to bibliometric analyses of the current literature of WOS (Web of Science), CUMINCAD (Cumulative Index about publications in Computer Aided Architectural Design supported by the sibling associations ACADIA, CAADRIA, eCAADe, SIGraDi, ASCAAD, and CAAD futures), predictable data have been presented allowing recommendations for possible future studies for researchers.
