N2 - Carefully engineered playable games can serve as vehicles for students and practitioners to learn and explore the programming of advanced computer architectures to execute applications, such as high performance computing (HPC) and complex, inter-networked, distributed systems. The article presents families of playable games that are grounded in the concurrent, parallel, and distributed manipulations and processing of sequences. Some examples of such manipulations are games that involve pattern matching, recognition, alignment, transformation, and evolution of sequences.

N2 - The present research assessed the structural validity of The Ross Test of Higher Cognitive Processes, a recently developed instrument designed to assess the higher-level thinking skills of analysis, synthesis and evaluation as outlined in Bloom’s Taxonomy. Confirmatory factor analysis, analysis of variance and trend analysis were used to test the correspondence between Bloom’s Taxonomy and the Ross Test, and to study the developmental nature of critical thinking. Subjects were 154 gifted third through sixth graders. Confirmatory factor analysis of individual test items and of the eight Ross subtests provided empirical evidence for the structural validity of this instrument, and normative data on gifted students’ performance on the test was presented. This investigation of the Ross Test yielded findings relevant to the use and interpretation of this measure of critical thinking in the gifted and regular classroom.

N2 - Heart failure is a major health risk, and with limited availability of donor organs, there is an increasing need for developing cardiac assist devices (CADs). Mock circulatory loops (MCL) are an important in-vitro test platform for CAD’s performance assessment and optimisation. The MCL is a lumped parameter model constructed out of hydraulic and mechanical components aiming to simulate the native cardiovascular system (CVS) as closely as possible. Further development merged MCLs and numerical circulatory models to improve flexibility and accuracy of the system; commonly known as hybrid MCLs. A total of 128 MCLs were identified in a literature research until 25 September 2020. It was found that the complexity of the MCLs rose over the years, recent MCLs are not only capable of mimicking the healthy and pathological conditions, but also implemented cerebral, renal and coronary circulations and autoregulatory responses. Moreover, the development of anatomical models made flow visualisation studies possible. Mechanical MCLs showed excellent controllability and repeatability, however, often the CVS was overly simplified or lacked autoregulatory responses. In numerical MCLs the CVS is represented with a higher order of lumped parameters compared to mechanical test rigs, however, complex physiological aspects are often simplified. In hybrid MCLs complex physiological aspects are implemented in the hydraulic part of the system, whilst the numerical model represents parts of the CVS that are too difficult to represent by mechanical components per se. This review aims to describe the advances, limitations and future directions of the three types of MCLs.

N2 - The work described is part of a programme exploring the utility of digital signal-processing techniques for studying certain aspects of the behaviour of water-waves. When such studies are undertaken in a closed wave-tank reflections from the boundaries can be troublesome. To this end a cepstral analysis has been attempted on wave-height measurements to locate and assess these reflections. The auto-regressive power-spectral estimate has been used to obtain the cepstrum with some success and the results are compared with those obtained by more conventional data processing methods.

N2 - Credit default has always been one of the critical factors in the development of personal credit business. By establishing a default identification model, default can be avoided effectively. There are some existing methods to identify credit default. However, these methods have some problems: Problem (1): It is different to deal the non-linear data, Problem (2): The local stagnation results in the high error rate, and Problem (3): The premature convergence leads to the low classification rate. In this paper, the sinhTSA-MLP default risk identification model is proposed to solve these problems. In this model, the proposed sinhTSA method can effectively avoid the problems of falling into local optimum and premature convergence. And the benchmark test results demonstrate sinhTSA is superior to other methods. According to the two experiments, the classification rate reaches 77.35% and 96.48%. Therefore, the sinhTSA-MLP default identification model has some particular advantages in identifying credit problems The feasibility of the sinhTSA-MLP default identification model has been proved through helping to manage credit default more consciously.

N2 - A micro-electro-mechanical model of the behavior of piezoelectric ceramics including thermal effects is presented and compared to experimental data. Results include analytical and numerical investigations of the behavior of piezoelectric ceramics. The model is based on physical mechanisms and includes elastic, dielectric, and piezoelectric anisotropy. Moreover, the model is based on an internal energy approach so that work-energy relations may be directly applied. Results from the model give insight into material behavior.

N2 - It is generally expected that the hydrogen bond strength in a D–H•••A adduct is predicted by the difference between the proton affinities (ΔPA) of D and A, measured by the adduct stabilization, and demonstrated by the infrared (IR) redshift of the D–H bond stretching vibrational frequency. These criteria do not always yield consistent predictions, as illustrated by the hydrogen bonds formed by the E and Z OH groups of protonated carboxylic acids. The ΔPA and the stabilization of a series of hydrogen bonded adducts indicate that the E OH group forms the stronger hydrogen bonds, whereas the bond length changes and the redshift favor the Z OH group, matching the results of NBO and AIM calculations. This reflects that the thermochemistry of adduct formation is not a good measure of the hydrogen bond strength in charged adducts, and that the ionic interactions in the E and Z adducts of protonated carboxylic acids are different. The OH bond length and IR redshift afford the better measure of hydrogen bond strength.

N2 - In this study, the corrosion behavior of biodegradable composites is modeled. These composites are made of Poly-Lactic acid and Magnesium with different volume fractions. The scanning electron microscopy images of these composites were taken, and statistical reconstruction of the composite based on scanning electron microscopy images was done by the phase recovery algorithm, the three-dimensional structure of this composite was extracted with this reconstruction, then a three-dimensional cellular automata model was developed to predict the corrosion of this composite. Results of experiments for the composite with 10% of Magnesium volume fraction were used to calibrate the parameters of the cellular automata model, and with these parameters, the results for the composite with 5% of Magnesium volume fraction was obtained, and with comparing these data with the results of the experiment, our model was validated. In the end, we estimated the mechanical properties of these composites and analyzed the results.

N2 - Experimental characterization of time-dependent properties for rectangular hollowcored, continuous fiber reinforced, commingled recycled plastic extruded forms under long-term (creep) flexural loading has been presented in this paper. Finite element based computer models have been developed to predict the effects of damage progression in such reinforced extruded plastic forms. In the long-term (creep) tests, reinforced and unreinforced extrusions with varying compositions were used as specimens. These extruded specimens were submerged in heated water and subjected to different loads. Experimental results indicate that fiber micro-buckling and fiber–matrix interface failure occur during the creep loading environment. The fiber micro-buckling occurs over time, compared with similar but dramatic damage that occurs in a short-period of time during short-term (static) loading, as discussed in Part I of this work. Experimental data also shows that these damage modes significantly reduce the long-term (life cycle) flexural properties, and the specimens with a coupling agent demonstrated much better performance. “Damage dependent” finite element models were developed using different material property types to represent the glass-fiber roving, fiber–matrix interface and plastic matrix respectively. Material nonlinearity of the plastic matrix has been incorporated along with stress-based failure criteria to account for fiber–matrix interfacial shear failure and local fiber micro-buckling. A user-defined material model has been incorporated into an industrial standard finite element software package to accommodate damage progression. The developed finite element based model(s) have correlated well with the long-term (creep) test results, and can provide a valuable tool in designing reinforced plastics for long-term loading conditions.
