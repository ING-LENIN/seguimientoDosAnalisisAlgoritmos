abstract = {It has been noted by many researchers that young bilingual children pass through a stage of early mixing which extends approximately until the age of 2;6 and ends abruptly. Research on bilingual first language acquisition has clearly excluded the possibility to explain mixed utterances as the result of a fused lexical or grammatical system. However, the actual debate on the reasons for early mixing still continues. Two main approaches have dominated the field of language mixing in adults: One assumes that adult’s codeswitching is constrained by grammatical principles, suggesting that a third grammar is responsible for the grammaticality of mixed utterances (e.g., the Equivalence Constraint formulated by Poplack (1980), or the Functional Head Constraint formulated by Belazi, Rubin & Toribio (1994) among others). Since child grammar is supposed to be organized differently from adult grammar, the grammatical “ingredients” of the principles which constrain codeswitching are absent in early child language (Köppe & Meisel, 1995). It therefore follows that early mixing in young bilingual children is not to be considered as constrained by any grammatical principles. The other approach argues that codeswitching in adults is not regulated by external grammatical principles, but that the only constraints which govern codeswitching are those required by the two languages involved (MacSwan, 2000). We will show that this assumption holds for child language as well. Our analysis of mixing opens the perspective that child grammar can be considered to be organized in the same way as adult grammar. Furthermore, we will argue that early mixing is related to developing performance abilities, in the present paper to the readiness on the bilingual child’s part to speak the language(s).}

abstract = {In this article we consider the problem of task-directed information gathering. We first develop a decision-theo retic model of task-directed sensing in which sensors are modeled as noise-contaminated, uncertain measurement systems, and sensing tasks are inodeled by a transforma tion describing the type of information required by the task, a utility function describing sensitivity to error, and a cost function describing time or resource constraints on the system. This description allows us to develop a standard condi tional Bayes decision-making model where the value of information, or payoff, of an estimate is defined as the average utility (the expected value of some function of decision or estimation error) relative to the current proba bility distribution and the best estimate is that which max imizes payoff. The optimal sensor viewing strategy is that which maximizes the net payoff (decision value minus observation costs) of the final estimate. The advantage of this solution is generality—it does not assume a particular sensing modality or sensing task. However, solutions to this updating problem do not exist in closed form. This motivates the development of an approximation to the optimal solution based on a grid-based implementation of Bayes’ theorem. We describe this algorithm, analyze its error properties. and indicate how it can be made robust to errors in the description of sensors and discrepancies between geomet ric models and sensed objects. We also present the results of this fusion technique applied to several different infor mation gathering tasks in simulated situations and in a distributed sensing system we have constructed.}

abstract = {Skin deformation caused by contact with an object is transduced into nerve signals by tactile mechanoreceptors, allowing humans to perceive tactile information. Previous research has revealed that the mechanical state associated with finger skin deformation at mechanoreceptor locations in a finite element model is correlated with the experimentally measured responses of slowly adapting type I mechanoreceptors. However, these findings were obtained under static contact conditions. Therefore, in this study, we calculated the von Mises stress at slowly adapting type I and rapidly adapting type I mechanoreceptor locations during dynamic scanning of a textured surface using a finite element model of the human finger. We then estimated the hypothetical responses of the mechanoreceptors and compared the estimated results with the nerve firing of the receptors in previous neurophysiological experiments. These comparisons demonstrated that the temporal history of von Mises stress at mechanoreceptor locations was more strongly correlated with the “number of” impulses (R2 = 0.93 for slowly adapting type I and R2 = 0.90 for rapidly adapting type I) than the impulse “rate” (R2 = 0.58 for slowly adapting type I and R2 = 0.53 for rapidly adapting type I). Our findings suggest that the temporal history of von Mises stress can be used to roughly estimate the number of impulses of mechanoreceptors during scanning of a textured surface.}

abstract = {The quality of intradisciplinary thinking during research design is crucial not only for alleviating multifaceted problems – such as global environmental change – but potentially to avoid worsening them. This article builds on the emphasis placed on research framing by human, physical and critical physical geographers by drawing from ideas on iterative framing in transdisciplinarity studies – as related to collaboration between geography’s internal subdisciplines – as well as from Gilles Deleuze, especially in Difference and Repetition (Deleuze, 1994 (1968)). Here, research reframing is based on a critical engagement with the contrasts in subdisciplinary foci and research methodologies, which I argue is achieved through a consideration of contrasting axiologies and facilitated by subdisciplinary encounter. I explore this approach to intradisciplinary thinking using examples from the literature in geography and beyond. Given that collaboration across research methodologies is challenging, I demonstrate one example practical approach to such intradisciplinary thinking: mapping. Different map-making and map-using activities can reflect contrasting forms of data and understandings from the field, and can therefore act as a shared space of encounter for geographers of all kinds.}

abstract = {In my research I meander through various disciplines, using fragments of AI that I regard as relevant, willing to learn from anyone whose ideas contribute. This makes me unfit to write the history of European collaboration on some area of AI research as originally intended for this collection. However, by interpreting the topic rather loosely, I can regard some European philosophers who were interested in Philosophy of mathematics as early AI researchers from whom I learnt much, such as Kant and Frege. Hume’s work is also relevant. Moreover, more recent work by Annette Karmiloff-Smith, begun in Geneva with Piaget then developed independently, helps to identify important challenges for AI (and theoretical neuroscience), that also connect with philosophy of mathematics and the future, rather than the history, of robotics. So this paper presents an idiosyncratic survey of a subset of AI stretching back in time, and deep into other disciplines, including philosophy, psychology and biology, and possibly also deep into the future.}

abstract = {Pair programming is a collaborative learning mode to foster novice learners’ computer programming. Previous empirical research has reported contrasting conclusions about the effect of pair programming on student learning. To further understand students’ pair programming, this study uses a mixed method to analyze three contrasting pairs’ collaborative behaviors, discourses, and perceptions from a multi-dimensional perspective. The analysis results show that the high-ranked student pair is characterized as the interactive, socially-supportive, and goal-oriented pair; the middle-ranked student pair is characterized as the highly-interactive, socially-supportive, and process-oriented pair; and the low-ranked student pair is characterized as the lowly-interactive, socially-unsupportive, and programming-distracted pair. The research reveals complex relations between collaborative behaviors, discourses, and performances, which have critical influences on students’ pair programming quality. Based on the results, this research proposes pedagogical, analytical, and theoretical implications for future instructional design, learning analytics, and empirical research of collaborative programming.}

abstract = {In this article, mode I interlaminar fracture toughness (GIC) of Vectran-stitched laminated composite is determined experimentally and computa- tionally. Critical strain energy release rates are measured by performing double can- tilever beam test on composites stitched with Vectran as stitch fiber, and are found to increase with increasing stitch thread thickness and stitch density. It is also revealed that the relationship between GIC and stitch density or stitch thread volume fraction appears to be linear. Interlaminar tension test is conducted to identify important fracture behavior of a single Vectran stitch fiber thread. The finite-element (FE) model of the stitched composite incorporates the novel four-step stitch fracture pro- cess, namely, interfacial debonding, slack absorption, fiber breakage, and pullout friction. The FE predictions of load-displacement curves and critical mode I strain energy release rates show good agreement with the experimental results. The differ- ences in interdependent stitch mechanisms between moderately stitched and densely stitched composites are discussed.}

abstract = {The mathematical problem of converting a normal spectrum into the corresponding first- and second-derivative spectra is formulated as an integral equation of the first kind. Tikhonov regularization is then applied to solve the spectral conversion problem. The end result is a set of linear algebraic equations that takes in as input the original spectrum and produces as output the second-derivative spectrum, which is then integrated to yield the first-derivative spectrum. Noise amplification is kept under control by adjusting the regularization parameter (guided by generalized cross-validation) in the algebraic equations. The performance of this procedure is demonstrated by applying it to different types of spectral data taken from the literature.}
