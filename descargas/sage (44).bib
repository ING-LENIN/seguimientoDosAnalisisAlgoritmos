abstract = {This article proposes a methodological approach that integrates quantitative analysis into ethnographic studies of online communities. By considering traces of interactions in digital environments, it demonstrates the potential benefits of computational analysis in enhancing online ethnography. The application of quantitative methods, which may be unconventional in the field of ethnography, effectively complements qualitative understanding. Computational analysis of digital traces provides a valuable framework for observations within online ethnography. Through a case study of a Russian-speaking sociological online community, this article highlights the points where research questions intersect, fostering a dialogue between computational analysis of digital traces and online ethnography. It describes the implementation of methods such as content analysis, network analysis, and topic modeling, while also reflecting on their analytical capabilities within the context of online ethnography.}

abstract = {A robust approach to computational kinematics intended to cope with algorithmic singularities is introduced in this article. The approach is based on the reduction of the original system of equations to a subsystem of bivariate equations, as opposed to the multivariate polynomial reduction leading to the characteristic univariate polynomial. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated for the exact function-generation synthesis of planar, spherical, and spatial four-bar linkages. Some numerical examples are provided for the case of the spherical four-bar function generator with six precision points to show the benefits of the proposed method with respect to methods reported in the literature.}

abstract = {Purpose Stenosis in a vascular access circuit is the predominant cause of access dysfunction. Hemodynamic significance of a stenosis identified by angiography in an access circuit is uncertain. This study utilizes computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to model flow through arteriovenous fistula to predict the functional significance of stenosis in vascular access circuits. Methods Three-dimensional models of fistulas were created with a range of clinically relevant stenoses using SolidWorks. Stenoses diameters ranged from 1.0 to 3.0 mm and lengths from 5 to 60 mm within a fistula diameter of 7 mm. CFD analyses were performed using a blood model over a range of blood pressures. Eight patient-specific stenoses were also modeled and analyzed with CFD and the resulting blood flow calculations were validated by comparison with brachial artery flow measured by duplex ultrasound. Results Predicted flow rates were derived from CFD analysis of a range of stenoses. These stenoses were modeled by CFD and correlated with the ultrasound measured flow rate through the fistula of eight patients. The calculated flow rate using CFD correlated within 20% of ultrasound measured flow for five of eight patients. The mean difference was 17.2% (ranged from 1.3% to 30.1%). Conclusions CFD analysis-generated flow rate tables provide valuable information to assess the functional significance of stenosis detected during imaging studies. The CFD study can help in determining the clinical relevance of a stenosis in access dysfunction and guide the need for intervention.}

abstract = {Detailed information of transient exhaled air dispersion and recirculation in the breathing zone can be obtained using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to generate detailed numerical models and obtain the necessary information. In this study, interaction of free convection flow around human body with respiration flow of breathing and vertical personalized flow from personalized ventilation (PV) system was simulated using a commercial CFD package. Impact of breathing process on personal exposure effectiveness εp was evaluated for different operating and environmental conditions. Re-inhaled exposure index εRI for exhaled CO2 was used to assess the amount of exhaled air re-inhaled due to the interaction between personalized and exhaled airflows. Another objective of this study was to consider the risk of airborne infection transmission, caused by undesirable transport and dispersion of exhaled pathogens to surrounding air when infected individual uses PV. Results show that calculation of personal exposure effectiveness would be sufficiently accurate to give proper information about the protection of occupant with a PV system also without the breathing simulation included. The operating mode of a PV proved as the main factor for dispersion of exhaled air and its transport to the background room air, resulting in an increased risk of airborne infection transmission.}

abstract = {False positive findings are a growing problem in many research literatures. We argue that excessive false positives often stem from model uncertainty. There are many plausible ways of specifying a regression model, but researchers typically report only a few preferred estimates. This raises the concern that such research reveals only a small fraction of the possible results and may easily lead to nonrobust, false positive conclusions. It is often unclear how much the results are driven by model specification and how much the results would change if a different plausible model were used. Computational model robustness analysis addresses this challenge by estimating all possible models from a theoretically informed model space. We use large-scale random noise simulations to show (1) the problem of excess false positive errors under model uncertainty and (2) that computational robustness analysis can identify and eliminate false positives caused by model uncertainty. We also draw on a series of empirical applications to further illustrate issues of model uncertainty and estimate instability. Computational robustness analysis offers a method for relaxing modeling assumptions and improving the transparency of applied research.}

abstract = {Digital fabrication and its cultivated spaces promise to break disciplinary boundaries and enable access to its technologies and computation for the broader public. This paper examines the trope of “access” in digital fabrication, design, and craft, and illustrates how it unfolds in these spaces and practices. An equitable future is one that builds on and creates space for multiple bodies, knowledges, and skills; allows perceptual interaction and corporeal engagement with people, materials, and tools; and employs technologies accessible to broad groups of society. By conducting comparative and transnational ethnographic studies at digital fabrication and crafting sites, and performing craft-centered computational design studies, we offer a critical description of what access looks like in an equitable future that includes digital fabrication. The study highlights the need to examine universal conceptions and study how they are operationalized in broader narratives and design pedagogy traditions.}

abstract = {Suicide, a leading cause of death, is a complex and a hard-to-predict human tragedy. In this article, we introduce a comprehensive outlook on the emerging movement to integrate computational linguistics (CL) in suicide prevention research and practice. Focusing mainly on the state-of-the-art deep neural network models, in this “travel guide” article, we describe, in a relatively plain language, how CL methodologies could facilitate early detection of suicide risk. Major potential contributions of CL methodologies (e.g., word embeddings, interpretational frameworks) for deepening that theoretical understanding of suicide behaviors and promoting the personalized approach in psychological assessment are presented as well. We also discuss principal ethical and methodological obstacles in CL suicide prevention, such as the difficulty to maintain people’s privacy/safety or interpret the “black box” of prediction algorithms. Ethical guidelines and practical methodological recommendations addressing these obstacles are provided for future researchers and clinicians.}

abstract = {Designing integrated systems of humans and automation involves envisioning how work will be performed, how it is affected by technological capabilities, and what will be helpful to support system performance. This is challenging as interactions and dynamics can create emergent effects that are difficult to predict. This demonstration aims to demonstrate the power of computational simulation in designing, verifying, and validating integrated systems of humans and automation. The demo will include an introduction to the simulation framework Work Models that Compute (WMC) used for our ongoing research, how to develop a work model in WMC, a demo of the simulation, and a demo of postprocessing visualization to analyze the simulation results. The approach can be applied in all stages of system design. With an example in aviation, we show how we use computational modeling and simulation to evaluate the robustness of envisioned operations of humans working with automated systems.}

It is argued that CBDTE provides plausible answers to central explanatory challenges posed by emotional experience, including: the phenomenal quality, intensity and object-directedness of emotional experience, the function of emotional experience and its relation to cognition and motivation, and the relation between emotional experience and emotion. In addition, CBDTE avoids most objections that have been raised against cognitive theories of emotion. A remaining objection, that beliefs are not necessary for the emotions covered by CBDTE, is rejected as empirically unsupported.}

The widespread examination of UCs across different disciplines leads to a variety of terms and constructs and thus a missing clarity about the discussed topics. With this computational scoping review, we uncovered six relevant, overarching topics and their development in the field. Due to the combination of an automatic text analysis via structural topic modeling and a qualitative evaluation, we were able to describe the current state of UC research and found an inherently interdisciplinary body of literature. We observed an inter- and intradisciplinary fragmentation and call for a systematization of the used terms, constructs, and examined topics.}
