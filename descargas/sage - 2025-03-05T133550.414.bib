abstract = {Four leading theories for high-energy rearranging collisions of nuclei with atomic targets are critically reviewed. The focus is on the central aspects of charge exchange, ionisation and detachment in scatterings of fast protons with atomic hydrogen, helium and negative hydrogen ions. The methods used include the impulse approximation (IA), reformulated impulse approximation (RIA), exact boundary corrected second Born (CB2 or B2B) approximation and continuum distorted wave (CDW) approximation. Regarding three-body problems, the most comprehensive computations to date are carried out on both differential (dQ/dΩ) and total (Q) cross sections for proton–hydrogen charge exchange at impact energies ranging from 25 keV to 7.5 MeV. Throughout this energy range, for which the measured results exist, the quantitative agreement between the RIA and the available experimental data is found to be systematically excellent. Moreover, the RIA consistently outperforms the IA, CB2 and CDW approximations. As to four-body problems, the analysis is centered on single electron capture and transfer ionisation as well as on one-electron detachment involving two-electron atoms and ions. For single charge exchange and transfer ionisation in proton–helium collisions, emergence of dynamic electron correlations is evidenced due to their progressively rising importance with increasing incident energies. Static electron correlations are found to be crucial for accurate quantitative predictions on electron detachment in collisions of protons with negative hydrogen ions. Above all, the major role in detachment is attributed to consistency between perturbation potentials and the corresponding scattering wavefunctions. Usefulness of perturbative distorted-wave collision theories critically depends upon a judicious intertwining of a powerful set of analytical tools from mathematical physics with highly accurate and efficient computational methods. The presently employed analytical methods deal with two- and three-center bound-free atomic form factors evaluated with the Cauchy complex contour integration technique followed by the Feynman-Dalitz-Lewis integrals. The final numerical task is reduced to evaluation of integrals of dimensions ranging from one to thirteen (1D–13D). For higher dimensions (6D–13D) that are encountered in this work, stochastic method are employed and especially the adaptive and iterative exact Monte Carlo code VEGAS proves to be remarkably useful. For lower dimensions (1D–5D), deterministic quadrature rules are advantageously used and particularly the plurivariate fast Padé transform (FPT) is established as a well suited and robust method for benchmark computations. The FPT remarkably accelerates slowly converging Riemann partial sums of varying length from the trapezoidal quadrature rule by using the Padé approximant. This method is operationally implemented through the Wynn recursive epsilon algorithm with the benefits of having a stable, efficient and low storage computational method of unprecedented accuracy.}

This computational study compares fuel impingement from a simulated air-assisted spray with that of a simulated spray from a swirl atomizer. Impingement occurs on a flat plate in a low ambient pressure case that approximates an early-injection condition and in a high ambient pressure case that approximates a late-injection condition.

abstract = {Background: Redox active metal cations, such as Cu2 +, have been related to induce amyloid plaques formation and oxidative stress, which are two of the key events in the development of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and others metal promoted neurodegenerative diseases. In these oxidative events, standard reduction potential (SRP) is an important property especially relevant in the reactive oxygen species formation. Objective: The SRP is not usually considered for the selection of drug candidates in anti-AD treatments. In this work, we present a computational protocol for the selection of multifunctional ligands with suitable metal chelating, pharmacokinetics, and redox properties. Methods: The filtering process is based on quantum chemical calculations and the use of in silico tools. Calculations of SRP were performed by using the M06-2X density functional and the isodesmic approach. Then, a virtual screening technique (VS) was used for similar structure search. Results: Protocol application allowed the assessment of chelating, drug likeness, and redox properties of copper ligands. Those molecules showing the best features were selected as molecular scaffolds for a VS procedure in order to obtain related compounds. After applying this process, we present a list of candidates with suitable properties to prevent the redox reactions mediated by copper(II) ion. Conclusion: The protocol incorporates SRP in the filtering stage and can be effectively used to obtain a set of potential drug candidates for AD treatments.}

abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the theoretical foundation and implementation of two alternative instructional courses that aimed to support the development of elementary school students’ early algebraic thinking. Both courses approached three basic algebra content strands: generalized arithmetic, functional thinking and modelling languages. The courses differed according to the characteristics of the tasks that were used. The first course involved ‘pure mathematical guided investigations’ emphasizing scaffolding steps in pure mathematics contexts. The second course focused on ‘applied open explorations’ underlining more open questions in applied everyday contexts. The courses were compared in respect to students’ learning outcomes. The findings, yielded from the analysis of pre-test and post-test data, indicated that the second course had better learning outcomes compared to the first.}

abstract = {The original definition of P systems calls for rules to be applied in a maximally parallel fashion. However, in some cases a sequential model may be a more reasonable assumption. Here we study the computational power of different variants of sequential P systems. Initially we look at cooperative systems operating on symbol objects and without prioritized rules, but which allow membrane dissolution and bounded creation rules. We show that they are equivalent to vector addition systems and, hence, nonuniversal. When these systems are used as language acceptors, they are equivalent to communicating P systems which, in turn, are equivalent to partially blind multicounter machines. In contrast, if such cooperative systems are allowed to create an unbounded number of new membranes (i.e., with unbounded membrane creation rules) during the course of the computation, then they become universal. We then consider systems with prioritized rules operating on symbol objects. We show two types of results: there are sequential P systems that are universal and sequential P systems that are nonuniversal. In particular, both communicating and cooperative P systems are universal, even if restricted to 1-deterministic systems with one membrane. However, the reachability problem for multi-membrane catalytic P systems with prioritized rules is NP-complete and, hence, these systems are nonuniversal.}

abstract = {Contemporary artificial intelligence and algorithmic processes address deep-seated existential challenges and modes of desire. In so doing, they produce computational systems of imagination, an “algorithmic as if” that enables the expression, transformation, and seeming overcoming of existential limitations via technological means. This article elaborates the character of the “algorithmic as if” by focusing on Deep Nostalgia, an online tool that turns personal photographs of the deceased into looped animations which smile, blink, and move, promising to overcome mortality by technologically “resurrecting the dead.” Performing a close-reading of Deep Nostalgia’s technological processes and the public discourse around its 2021 launch, the article highlights its combination of computational learning, forms of visual representation (photography, video, and animation), and distinctive realignments of temporal experience. Together, these frame the “algorithmic as if” as a magical and affective space for realizing impossible longings that are also reflexive encounters with the “limit-situation” of human mortality.}

abstract = {The use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques enables performance predictions of bearing designs to be made when the usual operating assumptions of the Reynolds equation Jail to hold. This paper addresses the application of a full three-dimensional thermohydrodynamic CFD approach to journal bearings. The journal/shaft may extend beyond the bearing length and the rotation effect is accounted for in the thermal transport process. A circumferentially uniform shaft surface temperature is not assumed. Cavitation modelling is based on averaged lubricant/vapour properties and does not set pressures directly, allowing sub-ambient pressures to be predicted. Lubricant inlet grooves are incorporated with conservation of mass and the possibility of backflow. The modelling is validated against published experimental work on fully circumferential, single inlet and two-inlet circular bore bearings. The predicted and experimental results are in general agreement, although the predicted cyclic variation of journal surface temperature is less than the experimental value. However, an assumption in the predictions was of a non-orbiting journal. The techniques developed may, in principle, be extended to the orbiting journal case providing a dynamic cavitation model can be formulated.}
