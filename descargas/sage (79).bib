abstract = {Metamodels can be used to reduce the computational burden associated with computationally demanding analyses of simulation models, although applications within health economics are still scarce. Besides a lack of awareness of their potential within health economics, the absence of guidance on the conceivably complex and time-consuming process of developing and validating metamodels may contribute to their limited uptake. To address these issues, this article introduces metamodeling to the wider health economic audience and presents a process for applying metamodeling in this context, including suitable methods and directions for their selection and use. General (i.e., non–health economic specific) metamodeling literature, clinical prediction modeling literature, and a previously published literature review were exploited to consolidate a process and to identify candidate metamodeling methods. Methods were considered applicable to health economics if they are able to account for mixed (i.e., continuous and discrete) input parameters and continuous outcomes. Six steps were identified as relevant for applying metamodeling methods within health economics: 1) the identification of a suitable metamodeling technique, 2) simulation of data sets according to a design of experiments, 3) fitting of the metamodel, 4) assessment of metamodel performance, 5) conducting the required analysis using the metamodel, and 6) verification of the results. Different methods are discussed to support each step, including their characteristics, directions for use, key references, and relevant R and Python packages. To address challenges regarding metamodeling methods selection, a first guide was developed toward using metamodels to reduce the computational burden of analyses of health economic models. This guidance may increase applications of metamodeling in health economics, enabling increased use of state-of-the-art analyses (e.g., value of information analysis) with computationally burdensome simulation models.}

New numerical techniques were integrated in the proposed multiple representative interactive flamelets model in order to speed up the central processing unit time in integrating chemistry and the β-probability density function of the chemical species to compute composition in the computational fluid dynamics domain. A parallel validation was performed both with constant-volume and heavy-duty diesel engine experiments, selecting similar operating conditions. In such way, both flame structure and heat release rate predictions are analyzed and the model capabilities with respect to its setup and mesh structure are assessed.}

abstract = {In associative models of simple conditioning, conductive connections (associations, Hebbian synapses) are strengthened by the repetitive temporal pairing of stimuli. The associations cause the animal to behave more adaptively, but they do not encode information about objectively specifiable properties of the conditioning experience. In information processing (computational) models, the temporal intervals in that experience are timed and the results recorded in memory for later use in computations that determine the decisions whether and when to respond to the conditioned stimulus. The predictions of these latter models depend on the ratios of remembered and currently experienced temporal intervals; hence, they are time-scale invariant. Two examples of empirical time-scale invariance are described: Neither the delay of reinforcement nor the ratio of reinforced to unreinforced presentations of the conditioned stimulus affects rates of acquisition and extinction. Time-scale invariance has far-reaching implications for models of the processes that underlie conditioning, for example, models of Hebbian synapses.}

abstract = {Abstract In this study, a theoretical analysis of a heating and cooling cycle during sterilization of a three-dimensional pouch filled with carrot-orange soup was presented and analysed. Transient temperature, the shape of the slowest heating zone (SHZ) during heating and the slowest cooling zone (SCZ) during cooling were presented and studied. The simulation covered the whole heating and cooling cycles of 3600s and 1200s durations, respectively. The computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code PHOENICS was used for this purpose. Saturated steam at 121°C and water at 20°C were assumed to be the heating and cooling media, respectively. The partial differential equations describing the conservation of mass, momentum, and energy were solved numerically using the finite volume method. The liquid food used in the simulation has a temperature-dependent viscosity and density. At the end of heating, the SHZ was found to have settled into a region within 30–40 per cent of the pouch height above the bottom and at a distance approximately 20–30 per cent of the pouch length from its deepest end. In the cooling cycle, the slowest cooling zone (SCZ) was found to develop in the core of the pouch and gradually migrate toward the widest end. The vertical location of this slowest cooling zone was about 60–70 per cent of the pouch height. Experimental validation has been performed by measuring the temperature distribution in the pouch during heating and cooling, using thermocouples fixed at different locations. The predicted results were in good agreement with those obtained from the experiments.}

abstract = {The aim of this article is to develop a three-dimensional computational model to simulate the traveling process of inlet distortion in fan and compressor with low calculated costs. The model is established based on the body force model in the framework of modern Computational Fluid Dynamics technology. The flow is assumed to be axisymmetric in each meridional blade passage. The impact of the solid blade shapes on airflow is modeled with blade blockage factor and blade body force. The relationships between blade body force and blade inlet Mach number together with attack angle are established with the deviation angle model and loss model. Meanwhile, the effect of the turbulent mixing is also taken into consideration. This developed computational code is then applied to the investigation of a transonic fan rotor and of a four-stage low-speed axial compressor under clean and distorted inlet condition. The predicted performance of both the fan rotor and the four-stage compressor with clean inlet are in line with the experimental results. A quantitative comparison is made between the computational results and the measurement data of the fan rotor with inlet distortion. Additionally, the transfer behavior of inlet distortion in the four-stage compressor is simulated by the model. All results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the model.}

abstract = {This paper describes computer simulations of the wind flow over the University of Calgary campus undertaken to assess the likely regions for siting wind turbines and photovoltaic modules. The importation and cleaning of the building geometries is discussed along with the requirements for modeling adjacent buildings on the accurate simulation over one building in particular. The effect of the terrain and the many trees on the campus is shown to be significant for the wind resource over the roof of a six-storey building. It is shown that the choice of turbulence model is not critical if the purpose of the simulation is to identify regions for further exploration via wind speed measurements.}

abstract = {Societies differ in susceptibility to social influence and in the social network structure through which individuals influence each other. What implications might these cultural differences have for changes in cultural norms over time? Using parameters informed by empirical evidence, we computationally modeled these cross-cultural differences to predict two forms of cultural change: consolidation of opinion majorities into stronger majorities, and the spread of initially unpopular beliefs. Results obtained from more than 300,000 computer simulations showed that in populations characterized by greater susceptibility to social influence, there was more rapid consolidation of majority opinion and also more successful spread of initially unpopular beliefs. Initially unpopular beliefs also spread more readily in populations characterized by less densely connected social networks. These computational outputs highlight the value of computational modeling methods as a means to specify hypotheses about specific ways in which cross-cultural differences may have long-term consequences for cultural stability and cultural change.}
