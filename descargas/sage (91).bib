abstract = {Bruner, Goodnow, and Austin’s (1956) research on concept development is re-examined from a connectionist perspective. A neural network was constructed which associates positive and negative instances of a concept with their corresponding attribute values. Two methods were used to help preserve the ecological validity of the input: 1) closely mapping the input to the actual visual stimuli; and 2) structuring the output layer based on Gagne’s (1962, 1985) work on human concept learning. This resulted in the addition of output units referred to as attribute context constraints. These units required the network to demonstrate the identification of attributes both relevant and irrelevant to the task of classification. Results suggest that the simultaneous learning of attributes guided the network in constructing a faster and more generalizable representation than when attribute constraints were absent. Results are discussed with respect to the advantages of computational approaches to studying learning.}

The radial distribution of axial velocity at the design flowrate is calculated when an empirical radial distribution of circulation is given. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling of the overall performance and the detailed flow field is performed using TASCflow software.

abstract = {Human-machine teams (HMTs) in complex work domains need to be able to adapt to variable and uncertain work demands. Computational modeling and simulation can provide novel approaches to the evaluation of HMTs performing complex joint activities, affording large-scale, quantitative analysis of team characteristics (such as system architecture and governance protocols) and their effects on resilience. Drawing from literature in resilience engineering, human-automation interaction, and cognitive systems engineering, this paper provides a theoretical exploration of the use of computational modeling and simulation to analyze resilience in HMTs. Findings from literature are summarized in a set of requirements that highlight key aspects of resilience in HMTs that need to be accounted for in future modeling and evaluation efforts. These requirements include a need to model HMTs as joint cognitive systems, the need to account for the interdependent nature of activity, the temporal dynamics of work, and the need to support formative exploration and inquiry. We provide a brief overview of existing modeling and simulation approaches to evaluating HMTs and discuss further steps for operationalizing the identified requirements.}

abstract = {Infrared radiation signatures of gas turbine engine exhaust are suppressed markedly when equipped with a serpentine nozzle compared to an axisymmetric nozzle. The aim of this paper is to research more detailed flow characteristics of the serpentine nozzle, and to this end a double serpentine nozzle cold fluid test was conducted in this paper, static pressures on the nozzle walls surface were measured, and schlieren flow visualizations downstream of the nozzle exit were observed. Then numerical simulations of the experimental model were carried out using CFD software with k-ɛ turbulence model adopted. And the effects of geometric design parameters (the length ratio of first S length to second S length and the centerline distributions) on serpentine nozzle performance were investigated numerically. Detailed flow characteristics were presented including the distributions of static pressure, Ma number (streamlines), wall shear stress (limited streamlines), and the total pressure. Results show good agreement between the experimental data and computation. Static pressure distributions on the upper and down walls surface of double serpentine nozzle are completely different compared to the traditional axisymmetric nozzle. The rapid turning and steep passage slope of the serpentine nozzle would result in high friction loss and strong secondary flow loss, hence the value of the length ratio of first S passage to second S passage is recommended to be chosen from 2:5 to 2:3. The centerline distributions are crucial to the nozzle design for its influence on air acceleration inside the nozzle. The centerlines with a rapid turning at the exit would result in a high Ma number, which brings on high friction loss and secondary loss at the turnings. For maximum efficiency of centerline distributions, it is recommended that curves with a gentle turning at each serpentine passage exit should be chosen.}
