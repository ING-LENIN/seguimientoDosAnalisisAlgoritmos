N2 - In this work, experimental and theoretical analyses of the power losses in an industrial planetary speed reducer were performed in order to define the weight of the different types of power losses in the global efficiency as well as to understand the appropriateness and the effectiveness of the models and tools available in the literature for the prediction of these power losses. From this investigation, it has emerged that even if for all the kinds of power losses improvements are in principle possible, those for which, at the same time, more improvements seem possible and effective models are lacking are the load-independent power losses. For this reason, a computational fluid dynamics methodology able to evaluate load-independent gear power losses in planetary gearboxes is proposed. The other types of power losses were determined by means of analytical models available in the literature and, together with the calculated load-independent gear power losses, compared with the experimentally determined power losses showing the effectiveness of the adopted calculation models.

N2 - A numerical model based on computational fluid dynamics is developed to analyze fluid flow and thermal aspects in grinding. The model uses multiphase fluid flow with heat transfer based on the volume-of-fluid method, convection, conduction in solids and a multiple reference frame model of the porous grinding zone. Fluid velocity vectors, useful flow rate, grinding temperatures and energy partition are predicted using the model. In lieu of direct measurements of these quantities, the verification relies on the indirect assessment of surface integrity. The simulation results provide adequate agreement with the measured residual stress, depth of heat-affected zone and full width at half maximum profile with respect to the grinding temperatures.

N2 - Computational design of small molecule putative inhibitors of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is presented. Plk1, which regulates the cell cycle, is often over expressed in cancers. Down regulation of Plk1 has been shown to inhibit tumor progression. Most kinase inhibitors interact with the ATP binding site on Plk1, which is highly conserved. This makes the development of Plk1-specific inhibitors challenging, since different kinases have similar ATP sites. However, Plk1 also contains a unique region called the polo-box domain (PBD), which is absent from other kinases. In this study, the PBD site was used as a target for designed Plk1 putative inhibitors. Common structural features of several experimentally known Plk1 ligands were first identified. The findings were used to design small molecules that specifically bonded Plk1. Drug likeness and possible toxicities of the molecules were investigated. Molecules with no implied toxicities and optimal drug likeness values were used for docking studies. Several molecules were identified that made stable complexes only with Plk1 and LYN kinases, but not with other kinases. One molecule was found to bind exclusively the PBD site of Plk1. Possible utilization of the designed molecules in drugs against cancers with over expressed Plk1 is discussed.

N2 - Recital 33 GDPR has often been interpreted as referring to ‘broad consent’. This version of informed consent was intended to allow data subjects to provide their consent for certain areas of research, or parts of research projects, conditional to the research being in line with ‘recognised ethical standards’. In this article, we argue that broad consent is applicable in the emerging field of Computational Social Science (CSS), which lies at the intersection of data science and social science. However, the lack of recognised ethical standards specific to CSS poses a practical barrier to the use of broad consent in this field and other fields that lack recognised ethical standards. Upon examining existing research ethics standards in social science and data science, we argue that they are insufficient for CSS. We further contend that the fragmentation of European Union (EU) law and research ethics sources makes it challenging to establish universally recognised ethical standards for scientific research. As a result, CSS researchers and other researchers in emerging fields that lack recognised ethical standards are left without sufficient guidance on the use of broad consent as provided for in the GDPR. We conclude that responsible EU bodies should provide additional guidance to facilitate the use of broad consent in CSS research.

N2 - With the current shift of increasing the computational power of a processor by including multiple cores instead of increasing the clock frequency, consideration of computational efficiency is gaining increased importance for computational fluid dynamics codes. This is especially critical for applications that require high throughput. For example, applying computational fluid dynamics simulations to multi-disciplinary design optimization requires a large number of similar simulations with different input parameters. Therefore, a reduction in the runtime of the code can lead to large reduction in the design process. In our case study, a two-dimensional, block-structured computational fluid dynamics code was optimized for performance on machines with hierarchical memory systems. This paper illustrates the techniques applied to transform an initial version of the code to an optimized version that yielded performance improvements of 10% for very small cases to about 50% for large test cases that did not fit into the cache memory of the target processor. A detailed performance analysis of the code starting at the global level down to subroutines and data structures is presented in this paper. The performance improvements can be explained through a reduction of cache misses in all levels of the memory hierarchy. The L1 cache misses were reduced by about 50%, the L2 cache misses by about 80% and the translation lookaside buffer misses by about 90% for the optimized version of the code. The code performance was also evaluated for multi-core processors, where efficiency is especially important when several instances of an application are running simultaneously. In this case, the most optimized version, a blocked version of the optimized code, more effectively maintained efficiency as more cores were activated compared to the unblocked version. This illustrates that optimizing cache performance may be increasingly important as the number of cores per processor continues to rise.

N2 - Today’s world allows people to connect over larger distances and in shorter intervals than ever before, widely monitored by massive online data sources. Ongoing worldwide computerization has led to completely new opportunities for social scientists to conceive human interactions and relations in unknown precision and quantities. However, the large data sets require techniques that are more likely to be found in computer and natural sciences than in the established fields of social relations. In order to facilitate the participation of social scientists in an emerging interdisciplinary research branch of “computational social science,” we propose in this article the usage of the Python programming language. First, we carve out its capacity to handle “Big Data” in suitable formats. Second, we introduce programming libraries to analyze large networks and big text corpora, conduct simulations, and compare their performance to their counterparts in the R environment. Furthermore, we highlight practical tools implemented in Python for operational tasks like preparing presentations. Finally, we discuss how the process of writing code may help to exemplify theoretical concepts and could lead to empirical applications that gain a better understanding of the social processes initiated by the truly global connections of the Internet era.

N2 - This paper is an introduction to the computational complexity theory. I believe that the standard courses in complexity theory make some things much more important than they really are, while things which I find extremely interesting are marginalized. Thus, it can be seen as my subjective view on what is important and interesting in computational complexity, and what is not. We state the basic facts from computational complexity theory using the blackboard computations (one-dimensional cellular automata) as the standard computation model; we argue the benefits of such approach. This article is somewhat based on my series of talks from Warsztaty Logiczne 2014 in Białka Tatrzańska, although these talks covered more topics, such as NL=coNL, and links between BPP and the polynomial hierarchy.

N2 - Presentation of data is a major component to academic research. However, programming languages, computational tools, and methods for exploring and analyzing data can be time consuming and frustrating to learn and finding help with these stages of the broader research process can be daunting. In this work, we highlight the impacts that computational research support programs housed in library contexts can have for fulfilling gaps in student, staff, and faculty research needs. The archival history of one such organization, Software and Services for Data Science (SSDS) in the Stanford University Cecil H. Green Library, is used to outline challenges faced by social sciences and humanities researchers from the 1980s to the present day. To compliment this history, participation metrics from consulting services (1999–2021) and workshops (2000–2021) are presented along with updated workshop participant feedback forms (n = 99) and further illustrate the profound impacts that these services can have for helping researchers succeed. Consulting and workshop metrics indicate that SSDS has supported at least 27,031 researchers between 1999 and 2021 (average of more than 1175 per year). A t-test on the feedback form data indicates that participant knowledge in workshops statistically significantly increased more than one scale point from workshop start to completion. Results also indicate that despite our successes, many past challenges continue to present barriers regardless of exponential advances in computing, teaching, and learning—specifically around learning to access data and learning the software and tools to use it. We hope that our story helps other institutions understand how indispensable computational research support is within the library.

N2 - Despite the growing popularity of digital narratives, research on digital storytelling and its spread through social media interactions remains limited. Inspired by the social contagion theory, we introduce the concept of narrative contagion—where a story shared by a person or organization prompts others to share their stories—and investigate its process and outcome in online cancer communities. Utilizing a large dataset of 849 Facebook posts, 47,291 comments, and 14,466 replies, our artificial intelligence (AI)-based computational analysis provides evidence for narrative contagion among individual users in organization-hosted cancer communities on Facebook. It also reveals different organizational message characteristics, such as emotional arousal, post topic, and request for storytelling, that affect user storytelling and emotional support in comments and replies. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of digital storytelling and its collective dynamics in online communities.
