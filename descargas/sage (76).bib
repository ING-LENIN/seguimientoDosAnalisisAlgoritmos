abstract = {This paper introduces the design of an agent-based leadership support system exploiting a computational model for development of individuals or groups. It is to be used, for example, as a basis for systems to support a group leader in the development of individual group members or a group as a whole. Using a computational model for Situational Leadership Theory and model-based reasoning techniques, the system monitors and analyzes the development level over time and provides support to the group leader by proposing for different points in time the most effective leadership behavior according to Situational Leadership Theory. The support model has been formally designed and, within a dedicated software environment, simulation experiments have been performed.}

abstract = {Our work with the Argus Prime (Schoelles & Gray, 2001) simulated task environment has uncovered a variety of strategies that subjects use, at least sometimes, during target acquisition. However, it is difficult to determine how well subjects implement these strategies and, if implemented, how much these strategies contribute to overall performance. Recently, we have adopted Byrne and Kirlik’s (2002) cognitive-ecological approach to determine what strategies work best in different task environments. In the work reported here, we took one computational cognitive model and, holding all else constant, swapped in and out alternative strategies for target acquisition. We then ran each of these simulated human users ten times through each of four interface conditions.}

abstract = {A computational fluid dynamics simulation method based on large eddy simulation is presented and applied to compute the sunroof buffeting of a sport utility vehicle. The simulation result, i.e. the buffeting level curve, coincides well with the road test. The simulation method is then employed to investigate the sunroof buffeting of a vehicle during the development process in the range of 30 km/h–90 km/h. The results show that the most severe sunroof buffeting occurs at 70 km/h, which corresponds to the resonant frequency of the cabin. Flow field visualizations reveal that strong pressure fluctuations are generated inside the cabin due to vortex shedding from the leading edge and impinging onto the trailing edge of the sunroof opening, which explains the mechanism of sunroof buffeting. A new deflector with a gap and a notched upper edge is designed to replace the original castle type deflector. The simulation results show that the newly designed deflector can reduce the buffeting level to 97.9 dB; that is, the sunroof buffeting is completely eliminated. Moreover, the phenomenon of sunroof buffeting reduction is explained by comparing and analyzing the flow field between the newly designed deflector and the original deflector.}

abstract = {Background: Recent studies on lateral knee anatomy have reported the presence of a true ligament structure, the anterolateral ligament (ALL), in the anterolateral region of the knee joint. However, its biomechanical effects have not been fully elucidated. Purpose: To investigate, by using computer simulation, the association between the ALL and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) under dynamic loading conditions. Study Design: Descriptive laboratory study; Level of evidence, 5. Methods: The authors combined medical imaging from 5 healthy participants with motion capture to create participant-specific knee models that simulated the entire 12 degrees of freedom of tibiofemoral (TF) and patellofemoral (PF) joint behaviors. These dynamic computational models were validated using electromyographic data, muscle activation data, and data from previous experimental studies. Forces exerted on the ALL with ACL deficiency and on the ACL with ALL deficiency, as well as TF and PF contact forces with deficiencies of the ACL, ALL, and the entire ligament structure, were evaluated under gait and squat loading. A single gait cycle and squat cycle were divided into 11 time points (periods 0.0-1.0). Simulated ligament forces and contact forces were compared using nonparametric repeated-measures Friedman tests. Results: Force exerted on the ALL significantly increased with ACL deficiency under both gait- and squat-loading conditions. With ACL deficiency, the mean force on the ALL increased by 129.7% under gait loading in the 0.4 period (P < .05) and increased by 189% under high flexion during the entire cycle of squat loading (P < .05). A similar trend of significantly increased force on the ACL was observed with ALL deficiency. Contact forces on the TF and PF joints with deficiencies of the ACL, ALL, and entire ligament structure showed a complicated pattern. However, contact force exerted on TF and PF joints with respect to deficiencies of ACL and ALL significantly increased under both gait- and squat-loading conditions. Conclusion: The results of this computer simulation study indicate that the ACL and the ALL of the lateral knee joint act as secondary stabilizers to each other under dynamic load conditions.}

abstract = {The direct-injection-premixed charge compression ignition–based combustion process with a high exhaust gas recirculation ratio and early injection timing is simulated using a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes–based commercial computational fluid dynamics code with a nonhomogeneous mixture auto-ignition combustion model. In addition, the formation processes of nitrogen oxide (NO), carbon monoxide (CO), and unburnt hydrocarbon are calculated. The calculation results are compared with the experimental data. According to the calculation results, the formation processes of NO, CO, and hydrocarbon are discussed in relation to the spray development and ignition point. Furthermore, the combustion process of two-stage injection is also calculated. The result shows that the combustion process is described well by this model except in the case where auto-ignition occurs in the squish area. Additionally, the relationship between the combustion process and the mixture distribution is clarified. The main origins of the unburnt hydrocarbon and CO emissions are located in the center region of the combustion chamber, where the mixture becomes excessively lean and low in temperature.}

abstract = {Robotics Education (RE) is viewed as a tool to narrow the gender gap in STEM fields, especially for promoting girls’ learning. As an emerging and potential model in RE, Pair Learning (PL) is different from Individual Learning (IL), which is impacted by many factors. Among them, social factors need to be further explored. Therefore, this study emphasized gender as a key social factor and focused on girls’ learning performance in different learning models (IL and PL) and gender pairing patterns (boy-girl and girl-girl), as well as exploring the effective pedagogy for enhancing girls’ learning performance in RE. To this end, we conducted a comparison experiment in two classes from the fifth grade in a Chinese primary school. Results indicated that: (a) PL outperforms IL in enhancing girls’ learning engagement; (b) PL and IL have the same effect on the girls’ learning attitude and robotics works; (c) Mixed-gender pairing is more beneficial for girls to complete robotics works than single-gender pairing; and (d) Mixed-gender pairing and single-gender pairing have the same effects on girls’ learning attitudes and engagement. The key findings, possible reasons, and implications for practice are also discussed.}

abstract = {As scientists, we create and disseminate knowledge. Resources from various benefactors open the doors of discovery. Likewise, we are obliged to disseminate our finding where they will have an impact. We want our thoughts and words to be heard. Yet, neither creation nor dissemination of newfound knowledge is easy. Some facts are more stubborn than others; prying them loose and describing them takes effort and discipline. In the 1980’s some of challenges to dissemination were reduced when open-access journals emerged. While the hallowed peer-review process remained, these journals provided access to knowledge without financial, legal or technical constraints to the reader. They provided an innovative venue to disseminate findings by using the world wide web as the main source of distribution.1 The impact of these journals is growing. In 2000 there were 740 open-access journals that produced 19,500 articles. In 2009, this grew to 4769 journals and 191,850 articles; this represents 20% of scholarly publications.2 In the open access world, the journal increasingly assumes the distribution role formerly undertaken by institutional libraries, while maintaining essential editorial quality. Intuitively, the increased accessibility of open access journals ought to lead to a greater number of citations. Numerous studies have verified this.3 Multiple studies have shown that articles published in an open access journal are referenced more frequently than those published elsewhere.3,4 I acknowledge that other factors influence whether a paper is cited aside from its publication in an open access journal: it must be widely accessible through the channels that researchers employ and–-at the risk of making a trite argument–-the paper must have sufficient merit to justify being cited. All of this supports the emerging importance of Biomedical Informatics Insights as a vehicle for disseminating scientific findings. In this special issue we present a second series of conference proceedings. The first, Sentiment Analysis of Suicide Notes: A Shared Task,5 produced over 20 manuscripts and was published soon after the conference. This issue reviews the scientific productivity of the first Computational Semantics in Clinical Text conference. This conference, chaired by Drs. Stephen Wu, Nigam Shah, and Kevin Bretonnel Cohen is described elsewhere, but it is an honor for Biomedical Informatics Insights to be the repository of the proceedings.}

abstract = {Climate change has the potential to displace large populations in many parts of the developed and developing world. Understanding why, how, and when environmental migrants decide to move is critical to successful strategic planning within organizations tasked with helping the affected groups, and mitigating their systemic impacts. One way to support planning is through the employment of computational modeling techniques. Models can provide a window into possible futures, allowing planners and decision makers to test different scenarios in order to understand what might happen. While modeling is a powerful tool, it presents both opportunities and challenges. This paper builds a foundation for the broader community of model consumers and developers by: providing an overview of pertinent climate-induced migration research, describing some different types of models and how to select the most relevant one(s), highlighting three perspectives on obtaining data to use in said model(s), and the consequences associated with each. It concludes with two case studies based on recent research that illustrate what can happen when ambitious modeling efforts are undertaken without sufficient planning, oversight, and interdisciplinary collaboration. We hope that the broader community can learn from our experiences and apply this knowledge to their own modeling research efforts.}

abstract = {In-cylinder water injection is a promising approach for reducing NOx and soot emissions from internal combustion engines. It allows one to use a higher compression ratio by reducing engine knock; hence, higher fuel economy and power output can be achieved. However, water injection can also affect engine combustion and emission characteristics if water injection and injector parameters are not properly set. Majority of the previous studies on the water injection are done through experiments. Therefore, subtle aspects of water injection such as in-cylinder interaction of water sprays, spatial distribution of water vapor, and effect on flame propagation are not clearly understood and rarely reported in literature due to experimental limitations. Thus, in the present article, a computational fluid dynamics investigation is carried out to analyze the effects of direct water injection under various injector configurations on water evaporation, combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of a gasoline direct injection engine. The emphasis is given to analyze in-cylinder water spray interactions, flame propagation, water spray droplet size distribution, and water vapor spatial distribution inside the engine cylinder. For the study, the water-to-fuel ratio is varied from 0 to 1. Various water injector configurations using nozzle hole diameters of 0.14, 0.179, and 0.205 mm, along with nozzle holes of 4, 5, 6, and 7, are considered for comparison in addition to the case of no_water. Computational fluid dynamics models used in this study are validated with the available data in literature. From the results, it is found that the emission and performance characteristics of the engine are highly dependent on water evaporation characteristics. Also, the water-to-fuel ratio of 0.6 with 6 number of nozzle holes and the nozzle diameter of 0.14 mm results in the highest indicated mean effective pressure and the lowest NOx, soot, and CO emissions compared to other cases considered.}
