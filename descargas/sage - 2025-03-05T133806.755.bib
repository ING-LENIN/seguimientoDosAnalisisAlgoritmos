N2 - This article highlights the ‘synergistic’ use of experimental fluid dynamics (EFD) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), where the two sets of simulations are performed concurrently and by the same researcher. In particular, examples from the area of ground effect aerodynamics are discussed, where the major facility used was also designed through a combination of CFD and EFD. Three examples are than outlined, to demonstrate the insight that can be obtained from the integration of CFD and EFD studies. The case studies are the study of dimple flow (to enhance aerodynamic performance), the analysis of a Formula-style front wing and wheel, and the study of compressible flow ground effect aerodynamics. In many instances, CFD has been used to not only provide complementary information to an experimental study, but to design the experiments. Laser-based, non-intrusive experimental techniques were used to provide an excellent complement to CFD. The large datasets found from both experimental and numerical simulations have required a new methodology to correlate the information; a new post-processing method has been developed, making use of the kriging and co-kriging estimators, to develop correlations between the often disparate data types.

N2 - We demonstrate a set of software tools designed to facilitate computational cognitive modeling of multitasking performance. The Modifiable Multitasking Environment (ModME) offers a flexible, browser-based platform for creating multitasking experiments. Simplified Interfacing for Modeling Cognition–JavaScript (SIMCog-JS) provides communication between the browser-based experiments in ModME and the Java implementation of the ACT-R cognitive architecture. The baseline configuration of these software packages enables an ACT-R model to perform pilot-like multitasking in the modified Multi-Attribute Task Battery, which is implemented as the baseline task available in ModME. We show how this combination facilitates the development of models for assessing multitasking workload. In this demonstration, we will explain the software packages and allow attendees to interact with system elements, particularly the ModME graphical user interfaces. All software is available open source for attendees to try themselves.

N2 - Kinship is a fundamental feature and basis of human societies. We describe a set of computational tools and services, and the logic that underlies these, developed to improve how we understand both the fundamental facts of kinship and how people use kinship as a resource in their lives. Mathematical formalism applied to cultural concepts is more than an exercise in model building, as it provides a way to represent and explore their logical consistency and implications. Not surprisingly, kinship terminologies are particularly amenable to formal representation. Researchers throughout the history of kinship studies have noted the logicality of kinship terminology systems. The logic is explored here through the kin term computations made by users of a terminology when computing the kinship relation one person has to another by referring to a third person for whom each has a kin term relationship. Kinship Algebra Modeler provides a set of tools, services, and an architecture to explore kinship terminologies and their properties in an accessible manner.

N2 - The practical feasibility is demonstrated of a traffic assignment method, dubbed area-spread assignment, that incorporates information on the spatial relationships between nodes, links, and zone boundaries. Tests of area-spread assignment were performed on networks from Fredericton, New Brunswick, and Racine, Wisconsin. To eliminate the effect of errors from other model steps in the tests, comparisons were made with a detailed network in Fredericton that contained all streets in the city and extremely small zones. The tests indicated that there is a substantial difference between area-spread assignment and a traditional assignment using centroid connectors. Area-spread assignment did a better job of replicating volumes on the detailed network, although computation times were much longer.

N2 - An 18% scale semispan model is used as a platform for examining the efficacy of microphone array processing using synthetic data from numerical simulations. Two hybrid Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes/Large-Eddy-Simulation (RANS/LES) codes coupled with Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings solvers are used to calculate 97 microphone signals at the locations of an array employed in the NASA Langley Research Center 14 × 22 tunnel. Conventional, DAMAS, and CLEAN-SC array processing is applied in an identical fashion to the experimental and computational results for three different configurations involving deploying and retracting the main landing gear and a part-span flap. Despite the short time records of the numerical signals, the beamform maps are able to isolate the noise sources, and the appearance of the DAMAS synthetic array maps is generally better than those from the experimental data. The experimental CLEAN-SC maps are similar in quality to those from the simulations indicating that CLEAN-SC may have less sensitivity to background noise. The spectrum obtained from DAMAS processing of synthetic array data is nearly identical to the spectrum of the center microphone of the array, indicating that for this problem array processing of synthetic data does not improve spectral comparisons with experiment. However, the beamform maps do provide an additional means of comparison that can reveal differences that cannot be ascertained from spectra alone.

N2 - Visual illusions and perceptual grouping phenomena offer an invaluable tool for probing the computational mechanism of low-level visual processing. Some illusions, like the Kanizsa figure, reveal illusory contours that form edges collinear with the inducing stimulus. This kind of illusory contour has been modeled by neural network models by way of cells equipped with elongated spatial receptive fields designed to detect and complete the collinear alignment. There are, however, other illusory groupings which are not so easy to account for in neural network terms. The Ehrenstein illusion exhibits an illusory contour that forms a contour orthogonal to the stimulus instead of collinear with it. Other perceptual grouping effects reveal illusory contours that exhibit a sharp corner or vertex, and still others take the form of vertices defined by the intersection of three, four, or more illusory contours that meet at a point. A direct extension of the collinear completion models to account for these phenomena tends towards a combinatorial explosion, because it would suggest cells with specialized receptive fields configured to perform each of those completion types, each of which would have to be replicated at every location and every orientation across the visual field. These phenomena therefore challenge the adequacy of the neural network approach to account for these diverse perceptual phenomena. I have proposed elsewhere an alternative paradigm of neurocomputation in the harmonic resonance theory (Lehar 1999, see website), whereby pattern recognition and completion are performed by spatial standing waves across the neural substrate. The standing waves perform a computational function analogous to that of the spatial receptive fields of the neural network approach, except that, unlike that paradigm, a single resonance mechanism performs a function equivalent to a whole array of spatial receptive fields of different spatial configurations and of different orientations, and thereby avoids the combinatorial explosion inherent in the older paradigm. The present paper presents the directional harmonic model, a more specific development of the harmonic resonance theory, designed to account for specific perceptual grouping phenomena. Computer simulations of the directional harmonic model show that it can account for collinear contours as observed in the Kanizsa figure, orthogonal contours as seen in the Ehrenstein illusion, and a number of illusory vertex percepts composed of two, three, or more illusory contours that meet in a variety of configurations.

N2 - The purpose of this study is to analyse the differences in the combustion process, and pollutants formation (especially soot) due to top-hat and boot injection-rate shapes at one specific high-load point of a single-cylinder small-bore diesel engine using multidimensional engine simulations. The simulations are performed using a response interactive flamelet model with detailed chemical kinetics. A detailed chemistry-based soot model is used for the prediction of soot emissions. The heights of the first and second stages of the boot shape are varied to observe the effect of the injected fuel mass distribution. In addition, results of boot shapes are compared with a trapezoidal (top-hat) shape. A detailed analysis of soot formation and oxidation is also presented for some selected rate shapes. Through computational analysis it is shown that the boot shapes have the potential to decrease combustion-generated noise and to lower emissions at the investigated load point compared to the top-hat shape. Variations in the temporal distribution of the injected fuel mass show that a lower height of the first stage and a higher height of the second stage of the boot shape result in a relatively slower rise of heat release (lower combustion-generated noise) in the early part of combustion and enhanced soot oxidation as a result of higher spray momentum near the end of injection.
