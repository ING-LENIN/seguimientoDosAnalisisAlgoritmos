abstract = {Background Expert elicitation (EE) has been used across disciplines to estimate input parameters for computational modeling research when information is sparse or conflictual. Objectives We conducted a systematic review to compare EE methods used to generate model input parameters in health research. Data Sources PubMed and Web of Science. Study Eligibility Modeling studies that reported the use of EE as the source for model input probabilities were included if they were published in English before June 2021 and reported health outcomes. Data Abstraction and Synthesis Studies were classified as “formal” EE methods if they explicitly reported details of their elicitation process. Those that stated use of expert opinion but provided limited information were classified as “indeterminate” methods. In both groups, we abstracted citation details, study design, modeling methodology, a description of elicited parameters, and elicitation methods. Comparisons were made between elicitation methods. Study Appraisal Studies that conducted a formal EE were appraised on the reporting quality of the EE. Quality appraisal was not conducted for studies of indeterminate methods. Results The search identified 1520 articles, of which 152 were included. Of the included studies, 40 were classified as formal EE and 112 as indeterminate methods. Most studies were cost-effectiveness analyses (77.6%). Forty-seven indeterminate method studies provided no information on methods for generating estimates. Among formal EEs, the average reporting quality score was 9 out of 16. Limitations Elicitations on nonhealth topics and those reported in the gray literature were not included. Conclusions We found poor reporting of EE methods used in modeling studies, making it difficult to discern meaningful differences in approaches. Improved quality standards for EEs would improve the validity and replicability of computational models. Highlights We find extensive use of expert elicitation for the development of model input parameters, but most studies do not provide adequate details of their elicitation methods. Lack of reporting hinders greater discussion of the merits and challenges of using expert elicitation for model input parameter development. There is a need to establish expert elicitation best practices and reporting guidelines.}

Starting from a project at Columbia University in 2012, I discussed the challenges and advancements in studying online interactions between Chinese local governments and citizens. Examining existing publications about Chinese Internets, I highlight several key shifts in research topics, the adoption of computational methods ranging from content analysis to the application of Large Language Models, pinpoint several underexplored areas including leveraging video as data and longitudinal designs, and look ahead to future directions in computational methods, including the role of artificial intelligence and the importance of integrating computational studies of Chinese Internet with fieldwork and historical analysis.}

abstract = {We characterize the computational complexity of a family of approximation multimodal logics in which interdependent modal connectives are part of the language. Those logics have been designed to reason in presence of incomplete information in the sense of rough set theory. More precisely, we show that all the logics have a PSPACE-complete satisfiability problem and we define a family of tolerance approximation multimodal logics whose satisfiability is EXPTIME-complete. This illustrates that the PSPACE upper bound for this kind of multimodal logics is a very special feature of such logics. The PSPACE upper bounds are established by adequately designing Ladner-style tableaux-based procedures whereas the EXPTIME lower bound is established by reduction from the global satisfiability problem for the standard modal logic B.}

abstract = {Facebook remains the most important platform where social media editors package and try to ‘sell’ media outlets’ online news articles to audiences. In one of the first studies of its kind, we assess how this practice was effectuated during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. We use computational analysis to determine the polarity, subjectivity and use of some linguistics features in the status messages of 140,359 Facebook posts of 17 mainstream and alternative news titles from Flanders (Belgium) between March 2020 and 2021. Among other things, we find that status messages score considerably higher than headlines in terms of polarity and subjectivity, and that they, along with the use of question and interrogation marks, peaked in the first months of the pandemic. We contextualise our findings within existing scholarship and wider trends in increasingly digitised and globalised media societies.}

abstract = {The wind flow field constitutes an important input parameter for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations that are used in architectural design for the design and analysis of natural ventilation strategies.  Despite indications that the wind flow field may vary between places, CFD simulations that do not adequately account for this potential variation are still commonplace. This may significantly compromise the integrity and accuracy of the CFD simulations. This study was a two-pronged investigation with the ultimate objective of contributing towards efforts aimed at improving the accuracy of the CFD simulations. Firstly, a framework for integrated meso-scale and micro-scale CFD simulations was developed. Secondly, the newly developed framework was then implemented by deploying it to study the variation of the wind flow field between a reference meteorological station, and a selected local building site. The findings confirmed the indications that the wind flow field might vary spatially. The integrated multi-scale framework that was developed as part of the study was not only able to capture the wind flow field variation, but it also provided a way to quantify it, ultimately, leading to the generation of a more accurate wind flow field characterization representative of the local conditions. Through its ability to integrate multiple spatial scales that typically influence one another, this framework can help to enhance the accuracy and integrity of the CFD simulations that are used for natural ventilation design. Practical application: The findings from this study can be particularly useful when undertaking spatially integrated CFD simulations to design and analyse natural ventilation strategies in the building design process.}

abstract = {Public administration is struggling to contend with a substantial shift in practice fueled by the accelerating adoption of information technology. New skills, competencies and pedagogies are required by the field to help overcome the data-skills gap. As a means to address these deficiencies, we introduce the Data Science Literacy Framework, a heuristic for incorporating data science principles into public administration programs. The framework suggests that data literacy is the dominant principle underlying a shift in professional practice, accentuated by an understanding of computational science, statistical methodology, and data-adjacent domain knowledge. A combination of new and existing skills meshed into public administration curriculums help implement these principles and advance public administration education.}

abstract = {It is widely recognised among educational theorists, educators and policy makers alike, that critical thinking should claim a superordinate place in our system of educational objectives. In the philosophical literature on this topic, critical thinking is often conceptualised as the educational cognate of rationality, which in turn is analysed as being comprised of the relevant skills and abilities to assess reasons and evidence, together with the intellectual dispositions to actively use these proficiencies in practice. The resulting picture is in many respects normative and idealised, following the style of philosophical theorising commonplace in the tradition of analytic philosophy of education. In contrast, certain recent empirical findings related to the rational performance of actual human beings seem to cast doubts on the extent to which we can expect people to fulfil these idealised normative standards of rationality. After introducing the relevant philosophical theories and psychological results, I ruminate on the implications these ideas have on our pedagogical views pertaining to critical thinking education.}

abstract = {Background Today Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used for simulating flow in many applications. The quality of the results, however, depends on various factors, like grid quality, boundary conditions and the computational model of the fluid. For this reason, it is important to validate the performed computation with experimental results. In this work, a comparison of numerical simulation with the oil film method was performed for two cardiovascular applications. Methods The investigations were conducted at various geometries, such as a bended cannula tubing, an impeller of a magnetically levitated rotary blood pump and tips of inflow cannulas. The oil film for the experimental validation was composed of black oil color and varnish. In the numerical simulation, color abrasion was displayed with a special post-processing tool by means of wall-attached pathlines. Results With the proper choice of numerical parameters, the computer simulations and the oil film method demonstrated good correlation. Improper generation of the simulation grid did lead to divergent results between the numerical simulation and the experiment. For the pump impeller as well as for the inflow cannulas, the calculation and the experiment showed similar flow patterns with backflow and stall zones. Conclusion The oil film method represents a fast and simple approach to help validate numerical simulations of fluid flow. The experimentally generated near wall flow patterns can be easily compared with the solution of the CFD analysis.}

abstract = {Information and communications technology (ICT) is crucial in any contemporary society, especially if its online presence is to be widely significant, but, in a national context, it is important to investigate whether there is a compelling ICT ‘politic’ in the education sector in Turkey. This study specifically focuses on the ICT for Educational Development (ICT4ED) (Fatih) project, valued at US$8 billion, which is an embodiment of future educational reform in centralist Turkey. The study investigates the level of policy-making capacity within the scope of the Fatih project, which promises to fully integrate ICT into education in order to solve many educational issues, such as establishing entrepreneurialism in education, improving ICT sectors, exporting educational services to other nations for profit, and, ultimately, meeting the overarching purpose of Turkey becoming a competitive nation. The discourse of the government is to explore technological opportunities within education in order to create new ‘profitable’ avenues that conceive education as a ‘commodity’ and a ‘private good’, which is another feature of fragmented centralisation through public-private partnership(s) for both covert and overt privatisations. While the Fatih project defines the future as having new, ‘fully integrated ICT in education’, this study presents three main normative arguments — with regard to the project’s political execution, technical development and philosophical conception — to refute its objectives and highlight that it is destined to fail, and to suggest what urgent matters the ICT4ED politic should highlight in future education.}
