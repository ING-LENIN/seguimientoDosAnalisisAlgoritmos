abstract = {Background Expert elicitation (EE) has been used across disciplines to estimate input parameters for computational modeling research when information is sparse or conflictual. Objectives We conducted a systematic review to compare EE methods used to generate model input parameters in health research. Data Sources PubMed and Web of Science. Study Eligibility Modeling studies that reported the use of EE as the source for model input probabilities were included if they were published in English before June 2021 and reported health outcomes. Data Abstraction and Synthesis Studies were classified as “formal” EE methods if they explicitly reported details of their elicitation process. Those that stated use of expert opinion but provided limited information were classified as “indeterminate” methods. In both groups, we abstracted citation details, study design, modeling methodology, a description of elicited parameters, and elicitation methods. Comparisons were made between elicitation methods. Study Appraisal Studies that conducted a formal EE were appraised on the reporting quality of the EE. Quality appraisal was not conducted for studies of indeterminate methods. Results The search identified 1520 articles, of which 152 were included. Of the included studies, 40 were classified as formal EE and 112 as indeterminate methods. Most studies were cost-effectiveness analyses (77.6%). Forty-seven indeterminate method studies provided no information on methods for generating estimates. Among formal EEs, the average reporting quality score was 9 out of 16. Limitations Elicitations on nonhealth topics and those reported in the gray literature were not included. Conclusions We found poor reporting of EE methods used in modeling studies, making it difficult to discern meaningful differences in approaches. Improved quality standards for EEs would improve the validity and replicability of computational models. Highlights We find extensive use of expert elicitation for the development of model input parameters, but most studies do not provide adequate details of their elicitation methods. Lack of reporting hinders greater discussion of the merits and challenges of using expert elicitation for model input parameter development. There is a need to establish expert elicitation best practices and reporting guidelines.}

abstract = {A method for the solution of the three-dimensional structural dynamics equations with large strains using a finite volume technique is presented. The proposed solution procedure is second order accurate in space and employs a second-order accurate dual time-stepping scheme. The momentum conservation equations are written in terms of the Piola-Kirchhoff stresses. The stress tensor is related to the Lagrangian strain tensor through the St. Venant-Kirchhoff constitutive relationship. The structural solver presented is verified through two test cases. The first test case is a three-dimensional cantilever beam subject to a gravitational load that is verified using theory and two-dimensional simulations reported in literature. The second test case is a three-dimensional highly deformable cantilever plate subject to a gravitational load. The results of this case are verified through a comparison with the modal response calculated by commercially available software. The focus of the current effort is the development and verification of the structural dynamics portion of a future fully coupled monolithic fluid-thermal-structure interaction code package.}

abstract = {The evolving digital world requires scientifically literate citizens who are able to critically evaluate Internet sources of varying credibility. Instruction on evidence evaluation in postsecondary education often focuses on peer-review as a singular indicator of credibility. With increased access to web-based scientific information, students must also learn to think critically in real-time about the dimensions of credibility. This study describes the integration of sInvestigator, a computational evidence-based scientific reasoning tool, with a class of 32 students in an undergraduate honors course focused on socio-scientific issues. A cross-disciplinary team of researchers with expertise in science education, scientific literacy, and evidence evaluation developed and implemented an online questionnaire to measure students’ development of digital scientific literacy. After using sInvestigator to evaluate sources of scientific evidence based on publisher reputation, author competence, and author objectivity, students were better able to assess the credibility of online information. Results of this study also confirm the potential to authentically assess students’ use of author and publisher information to evaluate digital scientific sources. The need for further research on the operationalization and measurement of digital scientific literacy is discussed.}

abstract = {Computational cognitive models typically focus on individual behavior in isolation. Models frequently employ closed-form solutions in which a state of the system can be computed if all parameters and functions are known. However, closed-form models are challenged when used to predict behaviors for dynamic, adaptive, and heterogeneous agents. Such systems are complex and typically cannot be predicted or explained by analytical solutions without application of significant simplifications. In addressing this problem, cognitive and social psychological sciences may profitably use agent-based models, which are widely employed to simulate complex systems. We show that these models can be used to explore how cognitive models scale in social networks to calibrate model parameters, to validate model predictions, and to engender model development. Agent-based models allow for controlled experiments of complex systems and can explore how changes in low-level parameters impact the behavior at a whole-system level. They can test predictions of cognitive models and may function as a bridge between individually and socially oriented models.}

abstract = {Continuous requirements for more efficient aircrafts lead to the design and analysis of novel propulsion configurations, with an example being the boundary layer ingestion. The complexity and integration challenges in such aircraft synergistic propulsion system characterize the research in this field, driven by the potential benefits. The aim of this article is to investigate the effects of boundary layer ingestion on the aerodynamics of a transonic wing, together with the quality of the flow ingested by the propulsion system. A two-dimensional computational model of a transonic airfoil with boundary layer ingesting propulsion system is developed in order to assess boundary layer ingestion for a commercial air transport at cruise conditions and highlight the complex integration issues arising from such configuration. A parametric analysis of the effects of flight conditions, nacelle geometry and engine operating point, on lift, pressure recovery, distortion, total pressure and velocity distribution at the intake, comes to enhance understanding of the performance of this configuration. The pressure distribution around the airfoil and the boundary layer growth are both substantially affected by the engine operating condition, which is represented by the mass flow ratio, with a direct impact on pressure recovery and lift. Mach number and angle of attack influences on lift and drag ingested are also investigated. Intake size and position on the airfoil appear to have significant effects on lift and losses ingested. In general, the results of this study include several aspects related to wing aerodynamics and ingested flow quality, which may facilitate design and integration of the boundary layer ingestion propulsion system for future commercial aircraft.}

New skills, competencies and pedagogies are required by the field to help overcome the data-skills gap. As a means to address these deficiencies, we introduce the Data Science Literacy Framework, a heuristic for incorporating data science principles into public administration programs. The framework suggests that data literacy is the dominant principle underlying a shift in professional practice, accentuated by an understanding of computational science, statistical methodology, and data-adjacent domain knowledge. A combination of new and existing skills meshed into public administration curriculums help implement these principles and advance public administration education.}

abstract = {Coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that targets the lower respiratory tract in human species. Since the target receptor molecule is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is highly expressed on the cell lining of the respiratory tract, the virus is responsible for causing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Computational tools such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning-based platforms are used for drug repurposing, identification, and selection of target molecules that can be used for vaccine development and antiviral drug production. Computer-aided drug designing, molecular docking and homology modelling are some of the most widely used in silico models for drug discovery against COVID-19. It is important to take preventive measures to control the spread of the virus. The present review focuses on the computational tools used for recognising the target molecules for vaccine production, the transmission networks of COVID-19 and the long-term strategies to prevent future pandemics such as COVID-19.}

abstract = {A computational study was conducted to determine the most stable configuration geometry, and to evaluate the stabilization energy in the interaction between different test aromatic compounds. Dimers of benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, and, one trimer comprised of two benzene molecules and one molecule of naphthalene, were the subjects of the study. Gaussian 09 quantum chemistry suite ab initio calculations were performed by using MP2 method and the basis set G-311G**. The exponent for the polarized d orbital of carbon α d(C) was given the value 0.8200. Such value was obtained from the benzene dimer optimization with very similar results as those reported from the CCSD(T) method. This methodology was implemented for evaluating the stabilization energy trend with increasing number of aromatic rings in the interacting molecules. Among all the cases studied the energy minimum was obtained for the one having the conformation of displaced parallel molecules. This result seems to indicate that it is also possibly to obtain such stable conformation in the case of more complex aromatic systems of the same sort as the one considered here.}

abstract = {Background Today Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used for simulating flow in many applications. The quality of the results, however, depends on various factors, like grid quality, boundary conditions and the computational model of the fluid. For this reason, it is important to validate the performed computation with experimental results. In this work, a comparison of numerical simulation with the oil film method was performed for two cardiovascular applications. Methods The investigations were conducted at various geometries, such as a bended cannula tubing, an impeller of a magnetically levitated rotary blood pump and tips of inflow cannulas. The oil film for the experimental validation was composed of black oil color and varnish. In the numerical simulation, color abrasion was displayed with a special post-processing tool by means of wall-attached pathlines. Results With the proper choice of numerical parameters, the computer simulations and the oil film method demonstrated good correlation. Improper generation of the simulation grid did lead to divergent results between the numerical simulation and the experiment. For the pump impeller as well as for the inflow cannulas, the calculation and the experiment showed similar flow patterns with backflow and stall zones. Conclusion The oil film method represents a fast and simple approach to help validate numerical simulations of fluid flow. The experimentally generated near wall flow patterns can be easily compared with the solution of the CFD analysis.}

abstract = {The three-dimensional time-domain computational fluid dynamics approach is employed to calculate and analyze the sound attenuation behavior of water-filled perforated pipe silencers. Transmission loss predictions from the time-domain computational fluid dynamics approach and the frequency-domain finite element method agree well with each other for the straight-through and cross-flow perforated pipe silencers without flow. Then, the time-domain computational fluid dynamics approach is used to investigate the effects of flow velocity, diameter, and porosity of orifices on the sound attenuation behavior of the silencers. The numerical predictions demonstrate that the flow increases the transmission loss, especially at high frequencies. Based on the above analysis, partially plugged straight-through perforated pipe silencer is proposed to improve the sound attenuation performance by increasing the flow velocity through the orifices. In order to eliminate the pass frequency of the perforated pipe silencers and improve the sound attenuation performance in mid- to high-frequency range, a folded straight-through perforated pipe silencer is designed and its sound attenuation behavior is analyzed numerically using the time-domain computational fluid dynamics approach.}
