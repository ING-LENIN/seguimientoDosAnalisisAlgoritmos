N2 - There has been significant recent interest in Agent Based Modeling in many social sciences including economics, sociology, anthropology, political science, and game theory. This article describes three problems that need to be addressed in order for such models to become effective tools for formulating new social theory and informing policy debates and suggests approaches to meeting them. These issues are computational epistemology, research methodology, and software technology. These innovations augment Agent Based Modeling to create an effective new tool base to help better understand complex social systems.

N2 - This commentary draws on a decade’s experience of teaching data journalism within a variety of contexts to describe the lessons learned regarding different pedagogical techniques and choices about the aspects of data journalism to teach. What emerges is a difference between classes aimed at a general audience, who might be sceptical and/or ignorant of the diversity of data journalism practice and those aimed at a more specialist audience aiming to go into the increasing numbers of roles dedicated to data-driven techniques.

N2 - The space layout problem encompasses challenges that rely on a diverse range of contexts regarding urban planning and architectural design, during the traditional design phases which require immense effort and time for the evaluation of the spatial elements’ characteristic needs. In order to eliminate the burden of considering all multidimensional design aspects at the same time, this research presents a three-bodied computational method for locating the spaces of the given architectural design program in a project site, according to the defined list of design objectives and criteria. Besides the determination of the layout according to the requirements of the spatial elements, this research proposes an integration of the space syntax theory’s analytical compounds in terms of Justified Graph Analysis and Integration Values as the fitness criteria for the multi-objective evolutionary optimization in the computational model. To satisfy the integrity levels of each various characterized element within site organization, that are implied inherently by the architectural design program and generate a sustainable space network layout for the project site.

N2 - Abstract Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) probably plays a greater part in the aerodynamic design of turbomachinery than it does in any other engineering application. For many years the design of a modern turbine or compressor has been unthinkable without the help of CFD and this dependence has increased as more of the flow becomes amenable to numerical prediction. The benefits of CFD range from shorter design cycles to better performance and reduced costs and weight. This paper presents a review of the main CFD methods in use, discusses their advantages and limitations and points out where further developments are required. The paper is concerned with the application of CFD and does not describe the numerical methods or turbulence modelling in any detail.

N2 - The need to partition or discretize numeric value ranges arises in machine learning and data mining algorithms. This subtask is a potential time-consumption bottleneck, since the number of candidate partitions is exponential in the number of possible cut points in the range. Thus, many heuristic algorithms have been proposed for this task. Recently, the efficiency of optimal multisplitting has improved dramatically, due to the introduction of linear-time algorithms for training error minimization and quadratic-time generic algorithms. Whether these efficient algorithms are the best obtainable, is not yet known. In this paper, we probe the inherent complexity of the multisplitting problem. We reflect results obtained for similar problems in computational geometry and string matching to the multisplitting task. Subquadratic optimization algorithms in computational geometry rely on the monotonicity of the optimized function. We show by counterexamples that the widely used evaluation functions Training Set Error and Average Class Entropy do not satisfy the kind of monotonicity that facilitates subquadratic-time optimization. However, we also show that the Training Set Error function can be decomposed into monotonic subproblems, one per class, which explains its linear time optimization. Finally, we review recently developed techniques for speeding up optimal multisplitting.

N2 - Parallel advances in communication and visualization technologies have enabled the study and visualization of human behavior at a scale and level of detail never before possible. Nowhere are these advances more evident than within the emerging field of computational social science. Using Adamic and Glance’s image of the political blogosphere as an example and social representations theory as a guiding framework, we explore how computational social science visualizations may aid and complicate public understanding of this new science. We conclude with a discussion of best practices for the production and reuse of computational social science images for public consumption.

N2 - Objective: We developed a computational model of the effects of sleep deprivation on the vigilance decrement by employing the methods of system dynamics modeling. Background: Situations that require sustained attention for a prolonged duration can cause a decline in cognitive performance, the so-called vigilance decrement. One factor that should influence the vigilance decrement is fatigue in the form of sleep deprivation. Method: We employed the methods of system dynamics modeling (numerical-integration techniques for modeling complex feedback systems) to create a computational model of the vigilance decrement. We then simulated the computational effects of sleep deprivation on the behavior of that model, using empirical data obtained from the literature for calibrating such effects. Results: Sleep deprivation of 2 hr over a 14-day period should produce an additional decline of 9% in detection performance over that found with the typical vigilance decrement, whereas 4 hr of sleep deprivation over 14 days should produce an additional decline of 14% in detection performance. Conclusion: With respect to dual-process theory, it is through its deleterious effects on analytical cognition that sleep deprivation should impact the vigilance decrement. Application: Such computational modeling may be advantageous for human-machine teaming by theoretically allowing a future autonomous software agent to anticipate the decline of human performance and compensate accordingly.

N2 - Digital trace data and computational methods are increasingly being used by researchers to study mental health phenomena (i.e. psychopathology and well-being) in social media. Computer-assisted mental health research is not simply a continuation of previous studies, but rather raises ethical, conceptual and methodological issues that are critical to behavioural science but have not yet been systematically explored. Based on a systematic review of n = 147 studies, we reveal a multidisciplinary field of research that has grown immensely since 2010, spanning the humanities, social sciences, and engineering. We find that a substantial majority of studies in our sample lack a standardized form of ethical consideration, focus on specific constructs and have a rather narrow focus on specific social media platforms. Based on our findings, we discuss how computational elements have influenced mental health research, highlight academic gaps and suggest promising directions for future studies.

N2 - Stress is a major problem in our society today and poses major concerns for the future. It is important to gain an objective understanding of how average individuals respond to events they observe in typical environments they encounter. We developed a computational model of stress based on objective human responses collected from human observers of environments. In the process, we investigated whether a computational model can be developed to recognize observer stress in abstract virtual environments (text), virtual environments (films) and real environments (real-life settings) using physiological and physical response sensor signals. Our work proposes an architecture for a computational observer stress model. The architecture was used it to implement models for the different types of environments. Sensors appropriate to the different types of environment were investigated where the aims were to achieve unobtrusive methods for stress response signal collection, reduce encumbrance and hence, enhance methods to capture natural observer behaviors and produce stress models that recognized stress more robustly. We discuss the motivations for each investigation and detail the experiments we conducted to collect stress data sets for observers of the different types of environments. We describe individual-independent artificial neural network and support vector machine based model classifiers that were developed to recognize stress patterns from observer response signals. The classifiers were extended to include a genetic algorithm which was used to select features that were better for stress recognition and reduce the use of redundant features. The outcomes of this research provide a possible future extension on managing stress objectively.

N2 - Background. Learning programming is a cognitively demanding field of study accompanied with various difficulties. Although there is a high demand in the market for programmers, software analysts and engineers, a high dropout rate is recorded in relevant fields of study. Serious games are a promising means of engaging students in learning programming by giving them more incentives and making the process of learning programming concepts and languages more entertaining. Aim. This article introduces a new serious game called PY-RATE ADVENTURES, which aims to assist young students in their introduction to the basic programming concepts using Python. The game does not have any prerequisites and is suitable for players with no previous knowledge of programming. This article aims to present important information regarding the analysis, design and pilot evaluation of PY-RATE ADVENTURES. Method. The game was evaluated by 31 people that had recently graduated or were students of an Interdepartmental Programme of Postgraduate Studies in Information Systems. The participants voluntarily played the game and answered a questionnaire based on the MEEGA+ model, after their hands on experience with the game. This questionnaire’s purpose was to evaluate PY-RATE ADVENTURES in terms of perceived player experience and short-term learning. Results. The participants positively evaluated the game almost in all the elements of player experience. Furthermore, the majority of the users consider that the game helped them to learn basic programming concepts in Python and stated that they would prefer to learn programming with this game rather than other teaching methods. Conclusion. The positive results of the pilot evaluation give us the motivation to proceed and evaluate the game with students in secondary education, in order to extract stronger and generalisable conclusions regarding the impact of the game as an educational tool for learning programming concepts.
