abstract = {Some of the most influential theories in organizational sciences explicitly describe a dynamic, multilevel process. Yet the inherent complexity of such theories makes them difficult to test. These theories often describe multiple subprocesses that interact reciprocally over time at different levels of analysis and over different time scales. Computational (i.e., mathematical) modeling is increasingly advocated as a method for developing and testing theories of this type. In organizational sciences, however, efforts that have been made to test models empirically are often indirect. We argue that the full potential of computational modeling as a tool for testing dynamic, multilevel theory is yet to be realized. In this article, we demonstrate an approach to testing dynamic, multilevel theory using computational modeling. The approach uses simulations to generate model predictions and Bayesian parameter estimation to fit models to empirical data and facilitate model comparisons. This approach enables a direct integration between theory, model, and data that we believe enables a more rigorous test of theory.}

abstract = {Anxiety is a pervasive emotional state that tends to arise in situations involving uncertainty due partly to social and contextual issues including competition, economic disparity, and social insecurity. Thus, distribution of aggregate emotions, such as in anxiety, may reveal an important picture of otherwise invisible social processes in which individuals interact with local and global opportunities, constraints, and potential threats. The aim of this study is to present a computational approach to the dynamic distribution of anxiety extracted from natural language expressions of users of Twitter, a popular global social media platform. We develop an unsupervised machine learning procedure based on a naive Bayes model to classify contents of anxiety, estimate the degree of anxiety, and construct a geographic map of spatiotemporal distribution of anxiety. To validate our mapping results, a multilevel statistical analysis was performed to examine how anxiety distribution is correlated with other district-level sociodemographic statistics such as rates of birth and early divorce. Implications for further research and extension are discussed.}

abstract = {Background. Educational games are nowadays used for facilitating the teaching and learning process of various subjects. History is one of the subjects that simulations and games are used for promoting active learning and supporting students in comprehending various history-related subjects. Aim. This article reports on a new educational game on Greek mythology, called MYTH TROUBLES, designed and developed from scratch with the aim of supporting primary school students in studying Greek mythology and raising their interest on the subject of history. Method. The article presents the educational rationale and design of MYTH TROUBLES in the context of an educational games design model proposed in the literature. Since the game was implemented with the platform of Scratch and it is available online both for students (or anyone interested in Greek Mythology) and game developers, some information for its implementation is also provided. The results of a pilot evaluation of MYTH TROUBLES with the help of 21 experienced school teachers are presented, along with proposals for improvement and extension of the game. Results. Teachers evaluated positively MYTH TROUBLES in terms of acceptability, usability, utility as an educational tool, as well as its interface and game play and expressed their willingness to use it in the classroom. Conclusions. MYTH TROUBLES is considered appropriate by teachers for supporting the teaching and learning of Greek mythology and assessing its educational value in class is the next step. Scratch is appropriate for implementing such educational games and sharing them with interested players and game developers.}

abstract = {The goal of the present work was to explore student perspectives about a course module designed with cognitivist and constructivist learning theories, the cognitive apprenticeship instructional model, and a T-shaped design, specifically the first module of a Computational Fluid Mechanics curricular unit within a Master of Computational Mechanics program. This module was redesigned accordingly after the professor participated in a faculty development course, Engineering Education Theory and Practice, at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto. Student perspectives on the efficacy of the redesigned course were solicited, along with those from students who had previously taken the course. Students who participated in the revised course module reported higher levels of satisfaction than students from the previous iteration of the course and were more likely to recognize the value of specific instructional activities. This paper describes the revision of the course module and a comparison of the student feedback before and after those revisions.}

The uniqueness of this article stems from the inclusion of comprehensive information on computational progress in the field of fusion-based, sintering-based, and mechanical deformation-based AM. A computational model’s role in determining the process framework for the desired outcome of the set properties of the AM components is recognised while presenting the process-microstructure maps, thereby appraising computational ability towards the qualification of products. The inclusion of a detailed discussion on the bi-directional coupling of machine learning and physics-based computational models provides a futuristic roadmap for the digital twin of metal-based AM.}
