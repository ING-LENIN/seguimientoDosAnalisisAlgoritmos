N2 - Abstract An overview over flamelet modelling for turbulent non-premixed combustion is given. A short review of previous contributions to simulations of direct injection (DI) diesel engine combustion using the representative interactive flamelet concept is presented. A surrogate fuel consisting of 70 per cent (liquid volume) n-decane and 30 per cent α-methyl-naphthalene is experimentally compared to real diesel fuel. The resemblance of their physical and chemical properties is shown to result in very similar combustion and pollutant formation for both fuels. In order to account for variations of the scalar dissipation rate within the computational domain, a method using multiple flamelets, called the Eulerian particle flamelet model, is used. A strategy is described for subdividing the computational domain and assigning the resulting subdomains to different flamelet histories represented by Eulerian marker particles. Experiments conducted with an Audi DI diesel engine and diesel fuel are compared to simulations using the surrogate fuel. The use of multiple flamelets, each having a different history, significantly improves the description of the ignition phase, leading to a better prediction of pressure, heat release and exhaust emissions of soot and NOx. The effect of the number of flamelet particles on the predictions is discussed.

N2 - The effects of different loading programs on the elasto-/viscoplastic behavior of rate-sensitive materials are analyzed with specific numerical examples. An appropriate solution scheme and a consistent tangent operator are applied which are capable of being adopted for general computational procedures. Numerical computations and results are reported which illustrate the rate-dependence of the elasto-/viscoplastic constitutive model in use. In the numerical analysis the loading is applied by increasing the pressure and accordingly a nondimensional loading program parameter is introduced. In the numerical results the significance of the loading program is thus emphasized with reference to the nonlinear response of the elasto-/viscoplastic material behavior of solids.

N2 - Two experiments were run to determine how presentation modality and duration influence children’s arithmetic performance and strategy selection. Third and fourth graders were asked to find estimates for two-digit addition problems (e.g., 52 + 39). Children were tested in three conditions: (1) time-unlimited visual, (2) time-limited visual, or (3) time-limited auditory conditions. Moreover, we assessed children’s working-memory updating and arithmetic fluency. Children were told which strategy to use on each problem to assess arithmetic performance while executing strategies, in Experiment 1, and were asked to choose the best strategy of three available strategies to assess strategy selection, in Experiment 2. Presentation modality influenced strategy execution (i.e., children were faster and more accurate in problems under visual than auditory conditions) but only in children with low updating abilities. In contrast, presentation modality had no effect on children’s strategy selection. Presentation duration had an effect on both strategy execution and strategy selection with time-limited presentation leading to a decline in children’s performance. Interestingly, specifically in children with low updating abilities, time-limited presentation led to poorer performance. Hence, efficient updating seemed to compensate for detrimental effects of auditory in comparison to visual and time-limited in comparison to time-unlimited presentation. These findings have important implications for determining conditions under which children execute strategies most efficiently and select the best strategy on each problem most often, as well as for understanding mechanisms underlying strategic behaviour.

N2 - This article analyses collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), complex securities that were at the heart of the recent financial crisis. The difficulties of analysing these securities are considered, and it is argued that the increasing complexity of CDOs that repackaged mortgage-backed securities outpaced the returns available to investors, and therefore the resources available to pay for the analysis required to value the securities adequately within the timeframe available. CDOs therefore faced the problem of computational intractability. Such an outcome was, the article argues, inevitable in financial innovation that sought to create ever-higher returns from the fixed returns on a pool of assets. CDOs created what the article labels a lemon-squeezing problem. Implications for regulatory responses to the crisis are briefly explored.

N2 - Reliable and robust computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers are nowadays commonly utilized in the design and analyses of various engineering systems, such as aircraft, turbomachinery, ships, and automotives. Although this has resulted in a drastic decrease of the number of prototype and experimental testing, the use of CFD in the design automation process is still limited. In practice, the geometry parameters that ensure satisfaction of assumed performance requirements are often obtained by repetitive CFD simulations guided by engineering experience. This is a tedious process which does not guarantee optimal results. On the other hand, straightforward automation attempts by employing the CFD solvers directly in the optimization loop are typically impractical, even when using adjoint sensitivity information, because high-fidelity CFD simulations tend to be computationally very expensive. In this paper, we describe a surrogate-based design optimization methodology that shifts the computational burden from the accurate and expensive high-fidelity CFD model to its fast and yet reasonably accurate surrogate. As the surrogate models are computationally much cheaper than the high-fidelity ones, the cost of the design process is greatly reduced. Here, the surrogates are constructed using low-fidelity CFD models and response correction techniques. Application examples, involving the design of axisymmetric hulls in subsonic flow, and airfoils in both subsonic and transonic flows, are presented.

N2 - Ongoing technological developments have made it easier than ever before for scientists to share their data, materials, and analysis code. Sharing data and analysis code makes it easier for other researchers to reuse or check published research. However, these benefits will emerge only if researchers can reproduce the analyses reported in published articles and if data are annotated well enough so that it is clear what all variable and value labels mean. Because most researchers are not trained in computational reproducibility, it is important to evaluate current practices to identify those that can be improved. We examined data and code sharing for Registered Reports published in the psychological literature from 2014 to 2018 and attempted to independently computationally reproduce the main results in each article. Of the 62 articles that met our inclusion criteria, 41 had data available, and 37 had analysis scripts available. Both data and code for 36 of the articles were shared. We could run the scripts for 31 analyses, and we reproduced the main results for 21 articles. Although the percentage of articles for which both data and code were shared (36 out of 62, or 58%) and the percentage of articles for which main results could be computationally reproduced (21 out of 36, or 58%) were relatively high compared with the percentages found in other studies, there is clear room for improvement. We provide practical recommendations based on our observations and cite examples of good research practices in the studies whose main results we reproduced.

N2 - Abstract A three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics modelling was carried out to investigate effects of variable valve timing (VVT) and variable valve actuation (VVA) on gas exchange and fuel-air mixing processes in a diesel homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine with early fuel injection. Four VVT or VVA strategies were conducted for this study: first, a negative valve overlap (NVO) strategy with fixed exhaust-valve-opening (EVO) and intake-valve-closing (IVC) timings but variable valve lifts, referred to as the NVO strategy; second, the NVO strategy with fixed valve profiles but variable EVO and IVC timings, referred to as the EVO strategy; third, the NVO strategy with fixed valve lifts and fixed EVO and IVC timings but variable exhaust-valve-closing (EVC) and intake-valve-opening timings, referred to as the EVC strategy; fourth, VVA with just variable valve lifts, referred to as the VMAX strategy. The results indicate that suitable NVO settings will enhance in-cylinder tumble and then increase turbulence intensity before compression end, although the increased NVO has a negative contribution to swirl ratio. It was found that reducing valve lifts alone is not an efficient way to retain the residual gas, but the function of reduced valve lifts will become significantly obvious by combining it with increasing NVO. For the effect of NVO on in-cylinder temperature, longer NVO not only will increase in-cylinder temperature because of the higher residual gas rate but also will improve the in-cylinder temperature homogeneity. On lowering the maximum valve lift or increasing the NVO, the unmixed region of the in-cylinder charge shrinks. The fuel-rich region expands because of the high intake velocity and enhanced turbulence intensity. This is beneficial to the forming of a global homogeneous charge. It has been noted from the current study that, as the droplet distribution may be influenced more by the in-cylinder air motion caused by NVO when the average droplet size is smaller, it is recommended that future studies explore the effects of VVT and VVA on diesel HCCI mixing and combustion with various advanced fuel injection strategies.

N2 - In the Institute of Thermal Turbomachinery (ITSM) at Stuttgart University, a three-stage model steam turbine was used to study the complex steam flow through the last stages of low pressure steam turbines. The conditions in this test rig were such that condensation occurred after the first stage, so that wet steam was prevalent in the last stage. In order to determine the inlet conditions for the last stage and for the validation of results of a numerical simulation of the condensing steam flow through the model turbine, both steam quality and the droplet size spectrum were measured in front of the stator of the last stage using a miniature combined optical/pneumatic probe. However, while the measured steam quality matched the numerical results quite well, there were considerable differences between the computed and the measured droplet size spectrum. The latter showed considerably larger droplets than predicted by computational fluid dynamics. In this paper, the measurement principle (light extinction) is presented and the inherent limitations for the determination of very small droplets with diameters of less than 0.2 µm are discussed. Issues related to this challenge are the availability of UV-wavelengths and the optical length used for the measurements. The reliability of the inversion algorithm used to analyse the light extinction data is shown by comparison with data from experiments using polystyrene suspensions with known particle size and concentration. Thereafter, the validity of the measurement results is reassessed based on numerical results and data from repeated measurements. It can be shown that the experimental results are reliable, implying that the numerical results suffer from inaccuracies. Apart from modelling issues, one reason for this could be that the inherent unsteadiness in turbine flows is neglected in steady computational fluid dynamics computations.

N2 - Fully three-dimensional computational fluid dynamic simulations with detailed combustion chemistry of a turbulent jet ignition system installed in a rapid compression machine are presented. The turbulent jet ignition system is a prechamber-initiated combustion system intended to allow lean-burn combustion in spark ignition internal-combustion engines. In the presented configuration, the turbulent jet ignition prechamber has a volume that is 2% of the volume of the main combustion chamber in the rapid compression machine and is separated from the main chamber by a nozzle containing a single orifice. Four simulations with orifice diameters of 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, 2.0 mm, and 3.0 mm respectively are presented in order to demonstrate the effect of the orifice diameter on the combustion behavior of the turbulent jet ignition process. Data generated by the simulations is shown including combustion chamber pressures, temperature fields, jet velocities and mass fraction burn durations. From the combustion pressure trace, the jet velocity, and other field data, five distinct phases of the turbulent jet ignition process are identified. These phases are called the compression phase, the prechamber combustion initiation phase, the cold jet phase, the hot jet phase, and the flow reversal phase. The four simulations show that the orifice diameter of 1.5 mm provides the fastest ignition and the fastest overall combustion as reflected in the 0–10% and 10–90% mass fraction burn duration data generated. Meanwhile, the simulation for the orifice diameter of 1.0 mm produces the highest jet velocity and has the shortest delay between the spark and the exit of a jet of hot gases into the main chamber but produces a slower burn duration than the simulation for the larger orifice diameter of 1.5 mm. The simulations for orifice diameters of 2.0 mm and 3.0 mm demonstrate that the combustion speed is reduced as the orifice diameter increases above 1.5 mm. Finally, a discussion is given which examines the implications that the results generated have in regard to implementation of the turbulent jet ignition system in an internal-combustion engine.
