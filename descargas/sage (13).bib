N2 - This article examines the articulation of computational journalism, focusing on how the meaning of the computational is discursively constructed and mobilized as a specific constellation of intelligibility within news organizations. Relying on the concept of articulation developed in cultural studies, the article asks what, exactly, is meant by the computational in the context of journalism? Drawing on interviews with key managerial staff, editors and developers at Scandinavian news organizations, three broad claims about the linkage between the computational and journalism emerged. These articulations include the notion that machines don’t have instincts, that democracy can never be personalized and finally that the computational is something to think with, rather than simulate. The argument is made that what can and cannot be calculated is not merely a technical question, it is also a deeply social, cultural, political and economic one. Thus, the computational emerges as an important organising framework and discursive order for thinking and talking about journalism in the digital age.

N2 - The sports statistics community is rapidly evolving. R is an open-source software in constant development that has gained a lot of popularity within statistical communities and sports analytics. This work presents a systematic review of the available R CRAN sport packages following PRISMA guidelines. We consider all packages active as of 18 February 2021. A total of 81 sport R packages created since 2006 were detected. Of these, 35.9% were authored by an American national, 69.1% include a dataset, 43.2% provide vignettes, and 65.4% have been updated at least once. The sport with the highest representation is basketball (n = 14, 17.3%), followed by soccer (n = 12, 14.8%) and packages related to physical activity (n = 11, 13.6%). There are no sports packages directed solely for the female gender, while 59.3% of packages are focused on professional athletes. Fifty packages (61.7%) are related to the sports performance analysis category, and web scraping (n = 43, 53.1%) was the main functionality in the collected packages. The creation of new R packages in the area of sports could help solve questions and tasks that still remain a challenge in this field, while continuing to help to improve the level of statistical education and computational thinking skills.

N2 - This study explored how Australian music technology courses teach employability skills. A curriculum mapping of 63 undergraduate courses was conducted with course learning outcomes aligned against two benchmarks. The first benchmark was the Ten Skills for the Future Workforce which identifies key employability skills graduates will require in the coming decade. The second benchmark was the Australian Qualifications Framework Specification for the Bachelor Degree which defines the generic skills graduates must obtain through Australian Bachelor Degrees. This curriculum mapping reveals that Australian music technology courses teach Novel and Adaptive Thinking, Computational Thinking, New Media Literacy, and Design Mindsets universally. However, this curriculum mapping also reveals a deficit in employability skills related to Cross-Cultural Competency, Transdisciplinarity, Virtual Collaboration, and Collaboration more generally. The implications of this mapping is that Australian music technology educators seem to be prioritizing specific technical and creative skills over higher-order applications of skills and knowledge which are contextualized in their broader social and cultural contexts. Finally, this article shows how curriculum mapping can be implemented to embed employability skills progressively across a program sequence using a case study from the School of Music, University of Queensland.

N2 - Reintroducing computer science (CS) education in K–12 schools to promote computational thinking (CT) has attracted significant attention among scholars and educators. Among the several essential components included in CS and CT education, program debugging is an indispensable skill. However, debugging teaching has often been overlooked in K–12 contexts, and relevant empirical studies are lacking in the literature. Moreover, novices generally have poor performance in domain knowledge and strategic knowledge concerning debugging. They also consistently experience a high cognitive burden in debugging learning. To address these gaps, we developed a flipped systematic debugging approach combined with a systematic debugging process (SDP) and the modeling method. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to explore the effectiveness of this flipped systematic debugging approach, in which 83 fifth-grade students attended the flipped debugging training lessons with the SDP–modeling method, and 75 fifth-grade students attended the unassisted flipped debugging training lessons without the SDP–modeling method. The results indicated that flipped debugging training using the SDP–modeling method improved students’ debugging skills. The results from the questionnaire showed that the proposed teaching approach increased the students’ investment in germane cognitive load by promoting schema construction. It also helped reduce students’ intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load in learning.

N2 - This article investigates a rapidly expanding branch of journalism innovation in online news media. The umbrella term computational exploration in journalism (CEJ), embraces the multifaceted development of algorithms, data, and social science methods in reporting and storytelling. CEJ typically involves the journalistic co-creation of quantitative news projects that transcend geographical, disciplinary, and linguistic boundaries. Drawing on extensive empirical data, this article provides a conceptual overview of the field by identifying three main pathways of computational exploration in journalism: the newsroom approach, the academic approach, and the entrepreneurial approach. Implications for changing journalistic practice are discussed, and the theorizing is summed up in a triplex proposition about changing mindset processes coming out of CEJ. The study indicates that the computational exploration not only leads to innovative uses of the technology, but also to innovative ways for journalists to think and behave; journalism innovation leads to innovation journalism.

N2 - Libraries as social spaces are bound to evolve based on a society’s level of civilisation and information media. This paper argues that the emergence of smart libraries have changed the paradigms of library by acknowledging the potential benefits and transformation smart library brings to library operations and services. It notes that analytical and computational thinking, data literacy, information literacy, social intelligence, programs and project management, cross-cultural competency, transliteracy, transdisciplinary, design thinking and mindset, virtual collaboration and cognitive load management are skills to be possessed by smart librarians. It highlights cloud computing, big data, 3D printing, IoT, Artificial Intelligence, RFID, drones etc., as the emerging technologies used for smart libraries and further discusses smart services, smart people, smart places and smart governance as the dimensions of smart library. Revelations are further made that smart libraries aid space saving, expansion of library working hours and services and promotes access to information, while remarks are made that lack of technological know-how, technophobia, data privacy and security, etc., are the challenges of smart library. It concludes that the emergence of smart library have facilitated the redefinition of library services and operations and recommends amongst others that librarians should continuously update their skills so that they can meet up with competitions that may arise from the challenges of globalisation of the information landscape.

N2 - The combination of the quantitative turn in linguistics and the emergence of text analytics has created a demand for new methodological skills among linguists and data scientists. This paper introduces KNIME as a low-code programming platform for linguists interested in learning text analytic methods, while highlighting the considerations necessary from a linguistics standpoint for data scientists. Examples from an Open Educational Resource created for the DiMPAH project are used to demonstrate KNIME’s value as a low-code option for text analysis, using sentiment analysis and topic modelling as examples. The paper provides detailed step-by-step descriptions of the workflows for both methods, showcasing how these methods can be applied without writing code. The results suggest that visual or low-code programming tools are useful as an introduction for linguists and humanities scholars who wish to gain an understanding of text analytic workflows and computational thinking. However, as with more traditional programming, caution must be exercised when using methods without fully understanding them. In conclusion, KNIME is a potential avenue for innovative research and teaching computational methods to humanities scholars.

N2 - Set in English Language Arts, this article takes up recent trends in literacy toward investigating ontological notions of digital texts. Two teacher educators recently implemented a series of readings and activities in their methods courses designed to help preservice teachers sophisticate their conceptions of texts beyond autonomous, neutral collections of information by considering digital age ideas such as software theory, textual ideology, and the algorithmic bias of the Internet. The authors review recent scholarship surrounding the integration of computational thinking and the humanities before illustrating a theoretical framework that combines software-driven interpretation and critical media literacy. Descriptions and applications of course texts and exercises precede a discussion on typological methodology. Through the analysis of semester-long writing reflections and course interactions, a typology of preservice teachers is then presented, illustrating three archetypes: Strategists, Hawkeyes, and Improvers. These archetypes are taken up to analyze the ways in which a range of teacher candidates considered ontological notions of digital texts to analyze instructional techniques, to sharpen their critical lenses, or to gain greater understanding of ELA as a discipline (or some combination of all three). This work demonstrates that as teacher educators and teacher candidates increasingly consider software-powered literacies, interrogations of who we are, who we are becoming, and what it all means requires attention to, and explicit practice with, the dark side of digital texts.

N2 - Deeper learning (DL) is firmly rooted in learning science and computer science. However, a dearth of review studies has probed its trajectory in DL in foreign languages(DLFL). Utilizing SSCI from the Web of Science Core Collection, we employ Citespace and Vosviewer to analyze the scientific knowledge graph of DLFL literature. Our analysis elucidates its geographical spread over time, highlights critical areas for further research, and identifies current trends in its evolution. The results show that DLFL research advances with the United States, China, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Australia ranking in the top five in terms of the number of articles published; the research hotspots focus on factors influencing DLFL, learners’ cognitive processes through language acquisition and information technology intervention in DLFL. The field of DLFL pertains to learning science, which is dedicated to enhancing learners’ performance, while computer science emphasizes utilizing advanced educational technologies as intervention tools. From learning science to computer science, both fields have followed distinct paths in their respective developments with a trend of integration, and the latter provided the former with a continuous supply of technology-mediated educational tools, including the future uses of computational thinking and ChatGPTs. As for future research directions, the development trajectory of DLFL will focus on natural language processing, cognitive neuroscience, and artificial intelligence. The findings will offer insights for future research on DLFL by enhancing the informational and computational literacy of both instructors and learners, empowering them to navigate and leverage the transformative potential of DLFL.
