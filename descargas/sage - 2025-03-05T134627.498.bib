N2 - Lime stabilization is a common technique used to improve the engineering properties of clayey soils. The process of lime stabilization can be split into two parts. First, the mobilization and crowding of ions or molecules from hydrated lime at net negative surface charge sites on expansive clay colloids. Second, the formation of pozzolanic products including calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) because of reactions within lime-soil mixtures. The pozzolanic reaction is generally considered to be more durable, while the adsorption has been associated with more easily reversible consistency changes. This study offers a protocol to assess whether the stabilization process is dominated by durable C-S-H (pozzolanic) reactions or a combination of cation exchange and pozzolanic reactions. Expansive clays with plasticity indices >45% from a major highway project in Texas are the focus of lime treatment in this study. The protocol consists of subjecting lime-soil mixtures to a reasonable curing period followed by a rigorous but realistic durability test and investigating the quality and quantity of the pozzolanic reaction product. Mineralogical analyses using quantitative X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) indicates the formation of different forms of C-S-H. In addition, geochemical modeling is used to simulate the lime-soil reactions and evaluate the effect of pH on the stability of C-S-H. The results indicate C-S-H with Ca/Si ratio of 0.66 as most the stable form of C-S-H among other forms with Ca/Si ratio ranging from 0.66 to 2.25. The effect of reducing equilibrium pH on C-S-H is also evaluated. A reduction in pH favored dissolution of all forms of C-S-H indicating the need to maintain a pH ≥ 10.

N2 - SARS-CoV-2 has been highly susceptible to mutations since its emergence in Wuhan, China, and its subsequent propagation due to containing an RNA as its genome. The emergence of variants with improved transmissibility still poses a grave threat to global health. The spike protein mutation is mainly responsible for higher transmissibility and risk severity. This study retrieved SARS-CoV-2 variants structural and nonstructural proteins (NSPs) sequences from several geographic locations, including Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and North and South America. First, multiple sequence alignments with BioEdit and protein homology modeling were performed using the SWISS Model. Then the structure visualization and structural analysis were performed by superimposing against the Wuhan sequence by Pymol to retrieve the RMSD values. Sequence alignment revealed familiar, uncommon regional among variants and, interestingly, a few unique mutations in Beta, Delta, and Omicron. Structural analysis of such unique mutations revealed that they caused structural deviations in Beta, Delta, and Omicron spike proteins. In addition, these variants were more severe in terms of hospitalization, sickness, and higher mortality, which have a substantial relationship with the structural deviations because of those unique mutations. Such evidence provides insight into the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein vulnerability toward mutation and their structural and functional deviations, particularly in Beta, Delta, and Omicron, which might be the cause of their broader coverage. This knowledge can help us with regional vaccine strain selection, virus pathogenicity testing, diagnosis, and treatment with more specific vaccines.

N2 - Interdisciplinarity is becoming increasingly important in education. With the rapidly evolving job market, an interdisciplinary education can prepare students for the flexibility and broad knowledge base required to adapt. At the University of Pisa, we recognized the value of an interdisciplinary educational environment during our participation in the European project EINFOSE, where we harmonized the entry requirements for master programs in Information Science. Prior to this project, we had been building study programs in Digital Humanities and Data Science, whose intersection organically nurtured a diverse learning space. Through this lens, we will reflect on the obstacles constituted by disciplinary barriers and stress the importance of a flexible and open ‘ecosystem’ for education. These conclusions will be supported by data analysis on the careers of our students over the last eight years.

N2 - In the context of recent debates about the ‘data deluge’ and the future of empirical sociology, this article turns attention to current activities aimed at achieving far-reaching transformations to the World Wide Web. The emergent ‘Semantic Web’ has received little attention in sociology, despite its potentially profound consequences for data. In response to more general recent calls for a critical politics of data we focus our enquiry as follows: first, we explore how sociological analysis of the artefacts and tools that are currently being developed to build a Semantic Web helps us to uncover the potential effects of this ‘next generation’ web on knowledge, data and expertise; and second we consider what a Semantic Web might offer to sociological research. We conclude by considering some implications of multidisciplinary engagement with the Web for the future of sociology.

N2 - In this research, a novel nanocomposite bone scaffold made up of Gelatin and Polypyrrole biopolymers and Akermanite and Magnetite bioceramics was fabricated utilizing the freeze-drying method. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and X-ray Diffraction (XRD) analysis were employed. The existing functional groups and crystalline phases were identified. Microscopic images were taken, and the mean pore cell size was 165.62 µm. According to the results of the liquid displacement method, the porosity was 68% ± 3%. The fabricated scaffolds showed maximum swelling of 1012% during 140 h. The bioactivity was monitored, and the formed Apatite layers were seen in microscopic images. The MTT assay was conducted by Osteoblast cells culture, and after 3 days, 100% cell viability was recorded. 2-D porous multiphase Representative Volume Elements (RVEs) were generated employing the modified Random Sequential Adsorption (mRSA) algorithm. Afterward, we imposed periodic boundary conditions on the boundaries of the RVEs. The homogenized elastic modulus along the X-axis was 14.81 kPa in biaxial compression. In this loading state, homogenized Young’s modulus along the Y-axis was 13.7 kPa. Homogenized Young’s modulus along Y-axis direction under uniaxial loading was 12.54 kPa. According to the micromechanical modeling results, non-isotropic behavior from such scaffolds was seen.

N2 - This study presents an inclusive K-12 AI curriculum for elementary schools, focusing on six design principles to address gender disparities. The curriculum, designed by the researchers and an elementary teacher, uses tangible tools, and emphasizes collaboration in solving daily problems. The MANOVA results revealed initial gender differences in AI knowledge. Following MANCOVA analysis showed significant improvements in AI knowledge, as well as perceptions and behavioral intentions toward AI, effectively bridging the observed knowledge gaps without any significant differences attributed to gender or initial knowledge levels. This evidence underscores the success of tangible and collaborative AI interventions in uniformly enhancing AI knowledge and positively changing perceptions and behavioral intentions among all participants, regardless of gender. Both female and non-binary students felt increased engagement and reduced anxiety toward AI, with improved comprehension and a preference for collaborative learning. This study contributes to the design of inclusive AI interventions, highlighting gender differences and including non-binary students as an essential part of the analysis.

N2 - Presenting oneself visually is an essential part of online behaviors on social networking sites (SNSs), and this is also the case for organizational accounts. Examining organizational self-presentation on their SNS accounts can show the key instruments through which organizations communicate online with the public. Thus, taking startups’ Instagram accounts as examples, this study aims to explore what and how organizations present visually on the photos uploaded to their Instagram accounts. The photos were analyzed in terms of their content, texts in photos, and facial and pixel-level characteristics. Photos and accounts were clustered respectively and resulting clusters were compared as well. The results suggest that text and people are the major objects represented in startups’ Instagram photos. The text presented in the photos was mainly about startups’ efforts to realize social values that can benefit communities by aiding people to do something in a timely manner. Two photo clusters were found: one mainly represented people and people-related words and the other mainly presented texts. Two account clusters were also found: one mainly consists of IT companies that presented texts in their photos and the other mainly consists of human-related services that presented people in their photos. This study can contribute to the body of literature by identifying the visual characteristics of organizational SNS photos and expanding self-presentation research to organizational SNS accounts.

N2 - Understanding differences in the genetic architecture of complex traits between the two sexes has significant implications for evolutionary studies and clinical diagnosis. However, our knowledge about sex-specific genetic architecture is limited largely because of a lack of analytical models that can detect and quantify the effects of sex on the complexity of quantitative genetic variation. Here, we derived a statistical model for mapping DNA sequence variants that contribute to sex-specific differences in allele frequencies, linkage disequilibria, and additive and dominance genetic effects due to haplotype diversity. This model allows a genome-wide search for functional haplotypes and the estimation and test of haplotype by sex interactions and sex-specific heritability. The model, validated by simulation studies, was used to detect sex-specific functional haplotypes that encode a pain sensitivity trait in humans. The model could have important implications for mapping complex trait genes and studying the detailed genetic architecture of sex-specific differences.
