abstract = {Abstract This paper demonstrates the suitability of using computational fluid dynamics software for solving steady state hydrodynamic lubrication problems pertaining to slider bearings, step bearings, journal bearings and squeeze-film dampers under conditions of constant unidirectional or rotating loading. The relevance of the inertia and viscous terms which are neglected in the derivation of the Reynolds equation are briefly investigated for the above bearing and damper configurations and it is shown that the neglected viscous terms have negligible effect whereas the inertia effect predictions agree reasonably well with those reported in the literature.}

abstract = {Anxiety is a pervasive emotional state that tends to arise in situations involving uncertainty due partly to social and contextual issues including competition, economic disparity, and social insecurity. Thus, distribution of aggregate emotions, such as in anxiety, may reveal an important picture of otherwise invisible social processes in which individuals interact with local and global opportunities, constraints, and potential threats. The aim of this study is to present a computational approach to the dynamic distribution of anxiety extracted from natural language expressions of users of Twitter, a popular global social media platform. We develop an unsupervised machine learning procedure based on a naive Bayes model to classify contents of anxiety, estimate the degree of anxiety, and construct a geographic map of spatiotemporal distribution of anxiety. To validate our mapping results, a multilevel statistical analysis was performed to examine how anxiety distribution is correlated with other district-level sociodemographic statistics such as rates of birth and early divorce. Implications for further research and extension are discussed.}

abstract = {The never-ending computational demand from simulations of turbulence makes computational fluid dynamics (CFD) a prime application use case for current and future exascale systems. High-order finite element methods, such as the spectral element method, have been gaining traction as they offer high performance on both multicore CPUs and modern GPU-based accelerators. In this work, we assess how high-fidelity CFD using the spectral element method can exploit the modular supercomputing architecture at scale through domain partitioning, where the computational domain is split between a Booster module powered by GPUs and a Cluster module with conventional CPU nodes. We investigate several different flow cases and computer systems based on the Modular Supercomputing Architecture (MSA). We observe that for our simulations, the communication overhead and load balancing issues incurred by incorporating different computing architectures are seldom worthwhile, especially when I/O is also considered, but when the simulation at hand requires more than the combined global memory on the GPUs, utilizing additional CPUs to increase the available memory can be fruitful. We support our results with a simple performance model to assess when running across modules might be beneficial. As MSA is becoming more widespread and efforts to increase system utilization are growing more important our results give insight into when and how a monolithic application can utilize and spread out to more than one module and obtain a faster time to solution.}

However, most of these studies are based on closed-ended survey research, which does not allow researchers to gain a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon. This study integrated survey analysis conducted within the United States with computational text analysis to reveal factors previously obscured by traditional survey methodologies. Even after controlling for political ideology‚Äîwhich has been the most significant explanatory factor in determining trust in science within a survey framework‚Äîwe found those with concerns over boundary-crossing (i.e. concerns or perceptions that science overlaps with politics, the government, and funding) were less likely to trust science than their counterparts.}

abstract = {Aerodynamics research in cycling has underpinned innovative bicycle design, new refined riding positions and optimised rider apparel. There has been a rise in the level of aerodynamics research focused on cycling since the turn of the millennium, enabled by significant increases in computational power and the availability of software/hardware. However, cycling research has not yet fully embraced para-cycling, with limited studies conducted on the aerodynamic performance of hand-cyclists and other para-cyclists. Wind tunnel experiments and computational fluid dynamics simulations were conducted in this research for the analysis of hand-cycling aerodynamics, focused on competitive H1‚ÄìH4 category hand-cyclists. A quarter-scale representative geometry of a hand-cyclist was used in high-speed wind tunnel experiments. The accuracy of the simulations performed with the three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier‚ÄìStokes equations was found to be dependent on the turbulence model choice and near-wall grid resolution. Computational fluid dynamics simulations predicted the magnitude of the drag and lateral forces to an accuracy of 2.5% using the shear stress transport turbulence model. This study also presents the impact of wheel diameter and disc wheels on hand-cycling aerodynamics via computational fluid dynamics simulations, providing a deeper understanding of the aerodynamic characteristics unique to the hand-cycling discipline in the sport of competitive cycling. Drag reductions of up to 8.9% were found when utilising 20-inch diameter spoked wheels, opposed to the 26-inch wheels. Variations in wheel diameter between the front and rear wheels were found to have a significant impact on the CDA in part through altering the pitch angle of the hand-cycle.}

abstract = {Many creative activities take place in a group context, whether in short-term meetings, work teams, or by means of electronic interaction. The group creative process necessarily involves the exchange of ideas or information. Recent models of group creativity have focused on the cognitive underpinnings of this type of group creative process, primarily based on the group brainstorming literature. The authors describe an elaborated computational version of their cognitive model of group creativity and related computational models, and highlight some plausible neural bases for various involved processes. The major findings and theoretical perspectives in this literature are summarized and some potentially fruitful empirical and theoretical directions are highlighted. It is hoped that this comprehensive treatment can be a basis for integrating the present literature and providing useful predictions for further research on this topic.}

One way to overcome this restriction is to implement computational intelligence to support and extend the search and exploration process.

abstract = {For over a decade, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) has been engaged in the applied research, development, and evaluation of computational toxicology methods used to support the safety evaluation of a diverse set of regulated products. The basis for evaluating computational toxicology methods is multi-factorial, including the potential for increased efficiency, reduction in the numbers of animals used, lower costs, and the need to explore emerging technologies that support the goals of the US FDA‚Äôs Critical Path Initiative (e.g. to make decision support information available early in the drug review process). The US FDA‚Äôs efforts have been facilitated by agency-approved data-sharing agreements between government and commercial software developers. This commentary review describes former and current scientific initiatives at the agency, in the area of computational toxicology methods. In particular, toxicology-based QSAR models, ToxML databases and knowledgebases will be addressed. Notably, many of the computational toxicology tools available are commercial products ‚Äî however, several are emerging as non-commercial products, which are freely-available to the public, and which will facilitate the understanding of how these programs work and avoid the ‚Äúblack box‚Äù paradigm. Through productive collaborations, the US FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, and the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition, have worked together to evaluate, develop and apply these methods to chemical toxicity endpoints of regulatory interest.}
