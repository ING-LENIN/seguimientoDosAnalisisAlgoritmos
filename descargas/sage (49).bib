N2 - Abstract A computational investigation of the interaction of the vectored primary jet from the main engine with the subsonic flow around a tailless unmanned air vehicle (UAV) configuration, with a cropped diamond wing planform, has been carried out. An initial study has been completed using Reynolds-averaged Navier—Stokes methods in conjunction with the shear-stress transport k—ω model. Various sets of simulations were performed on the basis of quantifying the thrust vectoring (TV) jet entrainment effects by means of aerodynamic forces and moments when key factors are combined, such as angles of thrust velocity deflection at different jet Mach number and angles of attack. It was found that reaction forces induced by the modified pressure on the integrated boundary of the body results in an enhancement of the TV effectiveness in producing the forces and moments required for the flight vehicle trim and manoeuvring. Those reaction forces were found to be independent of the angle of attack.

N2 - A combined experimental-computational approach is used for the analysis of hygrothermal performance of a brick wall provided with interior thermal insulation system. A 2D laboratory experiment is performed to determine temperature and moisture fields in a characteristic segment of the envelope over a sufficiently long period including cold winter months. Then, a computational model of moisture and heat transport is developed, using an integral two-phase balance equation capable of distinguishing between the particular phases of water and an enthalpy-based heat balance equation. A 2D computational representation of the experiment is used for model calibration and identification of unknown parameters, resulting in a very good agreement of experimental and calculated fields, with R2 between 0.9687 and 0.9888. The calibrated model is subsequently used for a long-term hygrothermal assessment of the studied detail to demonstrate the functionality of the interior thermal insulation system, as well as the applicability of the developed model.

N2 - Introduction A radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the best choice for achieving vascular access (VA) for hemodialysis, but this AVF has high rates of early failure due to juxta-anastomotic stenosis, making it impossible to use for dialysis. Low hemodynamic shear stress contributes to the pathophysiology of VA failure due to secondary thrombosis, stenosis, and re-occlusion after percutaneous intervention. Methods We used a computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) approach to evaluate the shear stress distribution and minimize its effects under various conditions including changes in the anastomosis angle. A three-dimensional computational domain was designed for arteriovenous end-to-side anastomosis based on anastomosis angles of 45°, 90° and including 135° angle of an obtuse anastomosis using three-dimensional design software. COMSOL Multiphysics® simulation software was used to identify the hemodynamic factors influencing wall shear stress at the anastomosis site using a low Reynolds number k-ε turbulence model that included non-Newtonian blood flow characteristics, the complete cardiac pulse cycle, and distention of blood vessels. In preliminary clinical study, all 201 patients who received a radiocephalic wrist AVF from January 2009 to February 2014 were divided into classic and obtuse angle groups. Results The CFD results showed that the largest anastomosis angle (135°) resulted in lower shear stress, which would help reduce AVF failures. This obtuse angle was preferred, as it minimized the development of anastomotic stenosis and tended to favor primary and primary-assisted patency in clinical study. Conclusions An obtuse radiocephalic wrist AVF shows more favorable patency compared to a classic radiocephalic AVF. Surgeons establishing a radiocephalic wrist AVF would be better to consider an AVF with an obtuse anastomosis.

N2 - There has been a continued expansion of the uses of computer-based tools and techniques in public sector endeavors: from traditional notions of data collection and management (bean counting) to the processing of data into information that supports managerial activities. Advances in technology based on emerging work in decision theory, information science, and cognitive science will allow for use of these computational models in more expansive “advisory” roles to decision makers of all types. To what degree can public sector decision makers use computational models to support or advise decision making? As these new technologies become a routine part of the policy process, will a belief in computer omnipotence tempt public sector decision makers to abdicate personal responsibility for poor choices? The authors explore the choice-related implications associated with the increased use of computer-based models, define possible computer-based decision support models (CBDSMs), and present a typology of credible uses of CBDSMs.

N2 - Any hydraulic reaction turbine is installed with a draft tube that impacts widely the entire turbine performance, on which its functions are as follows: drive the flux in appropriate manner after it releases its energy to the runner; recover the suction head by a suction effect; and improve the dynamic energy in the runner outlet. All these functions are strongly linked to the geometric definition of the draft tube. This article proposes a geometric parametrization and analysis of a Francis turbine draft tube. Based on the parametric definition, geometric changes in the draft tube are proposed and the turbine performance is modeled by computational fluid dynamics; the boundary conditions are set by measurements performed in a hydroelectric power plant. This modeling allows us to see the influence of the draft tube shape on the entire turbine performance. The numerical analysis is based on the steady-state solution of the turbine component flows for different guide vanes opening and multiple modified draft tubes. The computational fluid dynamics predictions are validated using hydroelectric plant measurements. The prediction of the turbine performance is successful and it is linked to the draft tube geometric features; therefore, it is possible to obtain a draft tube parameter value that results in a desired turbine performance.

N2 - Objective This study develops a computational model to predict drivers’ response time and understand the underlying cognitive mechanism for freeway exiting takeovers in conditionally automated vehicles (AVs). Background Previous research has modeled drivers’ takeover response time in emergency scenarios that demand a quick response. However, existing models may not be applicable for scheduled, non-time-critical takeovers as drivers take longer to resume control when there is no time pressure. A model of driver response time in non-time-critical takeovers is lacking. Method A computational cognitive model of driver takeover response time is developed based on Queuing Network-Model Human Processor (QN-MHP) architecture. The model quantifies gaze redirection in response to takeover request (ToR), task prioritization, driver situation awareness, and driver trust to address the complexities of drivers’ takeover strategies when sufficient time budget exists. Results Experimental data of a preliminary driving simulator study were used to validate the model. The model accounted for 97% of the experimental takeover response time for freeway exiting. Conclusion The current model can successfully predict drivers’ response time for scheduled, non-time-critical freeway exiting takeovers in conditionally AVs. Application This model can be applied to the human-machine interface design with respect to ToR lead time for enhancing safe freeway exiting takeovers in conditionally AVs. It also provides a foundation for future modeling work towards an integrated driver model of freeway exiting takeover performance.

N2 - Hydrodynamic effects of mussel farms have attracted increased research attentions in recent years. The understanding of the hydrodynamic impacts is essential for predicting the sustainability of mussel farms. A large mussel farm includes thousands of mussel droppers, and the combined drag on the mussel droppers is sufficient to possibly affect the longevity of the entire long-lines. This article intends to study the drag and wake of an individual long-line mussel dropper using computational fluid dynamics approaches. Two equivalent rough cylinders, namely, Curved-Model and Sharp-Model, have been utilized to simulate the mussel dropper, and each rough cylinder is assigned with surface roughness. The porosity is not considered in this article due to its complexity from inhalant and exhalant of mussels. Two-dimensional laminar simulations are conducted at Reynolds number from 10 to 200, and three-dimensional large eddy simulations are conducted at subcritical Reynolds number ranging from 3900 to . The results show that larger drag coefficients and Strouhal numbers are attributed to surface roughness and sharp crowns on the rough cylinder. The obtained drag coefficient ranges from 1.1 to 1.2 with respect to the diameter of the mussel dropper and the peak value of the tidal velocities. Wakes behind rough cylinders fluctuate more actively compared to those of smooth cylinders. This research work provides new insight for further investigations on hydrodynamic interactions between fluid and mussel droppers.

N2 - The primary objective of this investigation is to develop efficient and robust computational schemes for a damage-coupled cyclic thermoviscoplasticity model for solder materials. Three constitutive integration algorithms, Euler, modified Euler, and semi-implicit algorithm for the model are examined. The three algorithms for the model are coded in the commercial finite element (FE) code ABAQUS (version 6.21) via its user-defined material subroutine UMAT. Two single-step algorithms of the substep scheme are applied for the modified Euler algorithm to control the error in the integration of constitutive laws. A semi-empirical formulation is established for an adaptive time stepping algorithm that is based on the Euler algorithm. The simulations of single-element, miniature specimen and notched specimen simulations have been conducted and compared with the test results under monotonic tensile, creep, and fatigue tests of 63Sn-37Pb solder. It is observed that the explicit algorithm consistently requires much less CPU time than others. The modified Euler algorithm has shown, on the other hand, to be not only efficient but also accurate. The semi-implicit algorithm yields an accurate solution. It is worth noting that the method is also effective by applying an appropriate integration scheme.
