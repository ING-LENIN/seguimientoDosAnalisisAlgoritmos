abstract = {The concept of water quality has often generally revolved around the all-round safety of water for human consumption. The quality of much of the 3% of the earth’s humanly consumable water classed as freshwater is under threat of climate change, rising population numbers, indiscriminate land usage, detrimental agricultural practices and contamination from poor waste management. The need for optimal water quality enhancement has become more germane to sustainable socio-economic development. This paper examines the evolution of efforts made by the scientific community over the years to ensure water quality can be characterized and properly managed to ensure the global ever-growing demand for clean water for human consumption is continually met. The development of state-of-the-art computational decision support systems (DSS) should play a vital role. However, efforts in this regard are currently bedevilled by major challenges such as quantifying, measuring, processing and controlling the numerous metrics of water quality, as well as their adaptation and integration into a fully developed universal water quality model. In addressing these challenges, a shift towards simpler modelling approaches and the integration of uni-purpose models which can be cascaded into decision-making systems is being popularly proposed. However, with technological advancements already stimulating a water quality management revolution, there is a shift in paradigm to more universal modelling attempts with great optimism towards overcoming the challenges of developing universal water quality models and DSS. The prospects and opportunities of a water quality management renaissance offered by radical scientific innovations look promising, as the world races with time to provide support systems that can help deal better with the dynamics of sustainable water supply in increasingly contaminable environments and progressively unpredictable climates.}

abstract = {This introduction to a special section on algorithmic thought provides a framework through which the articles in that collection can be contextualised and their individual contributions highlighted. Over the past decade, there has been a growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI). This special section reflects on this AI boom and its implications for studying what thinking is. Focusing on the algorithmic character of computing machines and the thinking that these machines might express, each of the special section’s essays considers different dimensions of algorithmic thought, engaging with a diverse set of epistemological questions and issues.}

abstract = {This paper describes the implementation of the initial strain energy-based thermo-elastoviscoplastic two-parameter damage self-healing models for bituminous materials to compare the model predictions with experimental measurements. Computational algorithms based on the two-step operator splitting methodology are proposed and employed for numerical results. The elastic two-parameter damage self-healing predictor and the viscoplastic corrector are coupled with the Arrhenius-type temperature term via the net stress concept in conjunction with the hypothesis of strain equivalence and then systematically used for numerical implementation of the models. Four numerical examples of three-dimensional problems are first demonstrated for the effect of temperature and rest period for healing phenomenon. Second, experimental validation of the proposed model against monotonic constant-strain test at different temperatures and controlled-strain cyclic tension test is presented. It is observed that numerical simulations by the two-parameter model agree well with experimental results. In particular, the softening responses of the bituminous composites are well predicted for monotonic constant-strain rate test and the viscous damage behavior can be reasonably predicted by the proposed two-parameter damage models. It is noted that the two-parameter model can better predict the thermo-mechanical behavior of asphalt and is more versatile than the one-parameter isotropic damage self-healing model.}

abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) education is becoming increasingly important worldwide. However, there has been no measuring instrument for diagnosing the students’ current perspective. Thus the aim of this study was to develop an instrument that measures student attitudes toward AI. The instrument was developed by verifying the reliability and validity by 8 computer education PhD using a sample of 305 K-12 students. This scale made students’ attitudes toward AI operational and quantifiable. Accordingly, educators can use it to diagnose the current status of students or verify the effectiveness of new AI education methods.}
