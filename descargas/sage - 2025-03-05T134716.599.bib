abstract = {The increasing ubiquity of gamification in everyday life normalizes it as a motivational tool. While much scholarship supports gamification, labor sociologists have long problematized the phenomenon. In this mixed-methods action research study, we explore the results of gamifying a lesson on gamification in a sociology of work course. We designed two gamified activities with varying degrees of consent that followed a lesson on gamification and consent. Students rated how problematic a series of gamified work scenarios were before and after the intervention. Our quantitative data did not show a significant increase in students’ ability to identify consent after the intervention, but we did discover that students took either an employee or employer’s perspective in their rating justifications. Furthermore, these findings were gendered. This article highlights the need for a more critical take on gamification in the classroom. We conclude by suggesting ways practitioners can teach about gamification in other contexts.}

abstract = {The National Research Council (2011) released “A Framework for K–12 Science Education” that is guiding the development of the Next Generation Science Standards, which are expected to be finalized in early 2013. This article addresses language demands and opportunities that are embedded in the science and engineering practices delineated in the Framework. By examining intersections between learning of science and learning of language, the article identifies key features of the language of the science classroom as students engage in these language-intensive science and engineering practices. We propose that when students, especially English language learners, are adequately supported to “do” specific things with language, both science learning and language learning are promoted. We highlight implications for Common Core State Standards for English language arts and mathematics.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hospital re-engineering initiatives aiming to meet the requirement for patient-centered care often face significant barriers. Opportunities from the optimization of patient flow logistics are often overlooked due to the perception that patient transport related services are ancillary. OBJECTIVES: To reorganize patient pathways by optimizing inpatient assignment and outpatient unit relocation. METHODS: Our analysis was conducted in a campus-based hospital hosting 1694 inpatient beds. Patient flow data was used for algorithm-based optimization to minimize the sum of the distances due to visits to outpatient units and visits by consulting physicians. Inpatients were reordered and outpatient units were relocated to minimize transport need. Optimized schemes were analyzed using graph- and spectral graph theory. RESULTS: Both optimizations yielded an altered hospital layout in which the need for patient transfers decreased (over 30% and 23% in terms of total distance and transfer episodes, respectively). The optimized systems gave rise to buildings with greater specialization, higher importance in terms of contributing to the network architecture, greater synchronization and robustness. CONCLUSIONS: The top-down algorithm-based optimization scheme yielded a system in which the need for cross-building patient transfer decreased. We suggest that network analysis may be a useful tool for capacity planning.}

abstract = {To evaluate the dispersion of a heavy gas, such as sulphur hexafluoride, with a low Froude number in a built environment, an experimental and numerical simulation study was conducted. The experiment was carried out using seven different injection inlet configurations in an experimental chamber. The release rate was found to have a great effect on the concentration in the lower part of the chamber. The obstacle in the middle of the chamber could cause a non-uniform distribution of concentration, particularly due to variations in locations and angles of the release outlets. Additionally, numerical simulations were carried out to evaluate four turbulence models: the standard k-ε model, the realizable k-ε model, the re-normalization group (RNG) k-ε model and the shear stress transport (SST) k-ω model. Four indicators were used to evaluate the turbulent model performance. In general, the SST k-ω model performed the best, with geometric mean bias (MG) = 0.968 and geometric variance (VG) = 1.09 at 0.055 m height, and with MG = 0.384 and VG = 2.80 at 0.6 m height. The standard k-ε model was the next best in performance, followed by the realizable k-ε and the RNG k-ε model.}
