abstract = {A framework is presented for step-by-step imple mentation of weighted-residual methods (MWR) for simulations that require the solution of boundary-value problems. A set of MATLAB-based functions of the computationally common MWR solution steps has been developed and is used in the application of eigenfunction expansion, collo cation, and Galerkin-projection discretizations of time-dependent, distributed-parameter system models. Four industrially relevant examples taken from electronic materials and chemical processing applications are used to demonstrate the simula tion approach developed. This library of functions and several demonstration scripts can be obtained from the MWRtools project Website located at http://www.ench.umd.edu/software/MWRtools.}

abstract = {A novel adaptive fuzzy control approach with low computational costs is addressed for the longitudinal non-affine model of a generic hypersonic vehicle subject to parametric uncertainties, capable of guaranteeing that altitude and velocity tracking errors exhibit prescribed performance. A new performance function is devised to impose preselected bounds on the transient and steady-state tracking error performance, and then a transformed error is constructed, which converts the original “constrained” system into an equivalent “unconstrained” one for the simplicity of control designs. Furthermore, a simplified fuzzy controller is exploited for the altitude subsystem, eliminating the issue of “explosion of complexity” that is associated with back-stepping control. For the velocity subsystem, a prescribed performance-based proportional–integral controller is utilized. The special contributions of the proposed control strategy are that it can guarantee altitude and velocity tracking errors with desired transient and steady-state performance, and meanwhile the computational load is quite low. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to verify the efficiency of the design.}

abstract = {In this paper the characteristics and performance are described of a computational process model (CPM) of human way-finding that is based on psychological models of cognition and experimental data on human way-finding. The model comprises two modules, one for representing objectively a suburban environment and the other for representing the cognitive processes involved in navigation. The CPM is employed to simulate and investigate how spatial knowledge that has been acquired and stored is retrieved and processed in order to plan a path to a given goal. The results of the experiments carried out with NAVIGATOR are compared with the results of experiments involving young adults in real environments. We analyze the performance of NAVIGATOR in terms of its ability to find the goal, the amount of time taken to reach a given goal, the differences in performance during way-finding, and the errors in navigation, as a function of several parameters. The parameters are intended to represent key psychological components of human perceptual and cognitive systems and are derived from experimental studies of human way-finding behavior. The main value of this model lies in its use as a device for investigating and understanding human spatial performance, in terms of accurate performance and errors that arise in tasks of way-finding, and the variations among individuals in terms of performance. A set of computational experiments are used to examine the differences in search strategies between ‘individuals’. The effects of various parameters on way-finding performance are analyzed. Errors in way-finding are classified and are compared with Norman’s and Reason’s classification of errors in human performance. The CPM appears to provide a fruitful model for investigating human way-finding behavior.}

abstract = {A micromechanical model was established based on the fluid dynamics theory. This model could be used to calculate several kinds of data when the asphalt pavement under the influence of traffic loading is in water-saturated condition. The results showed that the maximum pressure inside the effective pore was located at the junction between exit slits and the pore wall. There was a positive correlation between the pressure and the vehicle speed. Therefore, the repeated traffic loading could cause emulsification, shift and even peeling of the asphalt membrane. Moreover, the bigger size of the exit slit is, the higher velocity of the fluid has. The high velocity flow keeps scouring both the exit slit and the lower boundary of pore wall. It will cause a bigger slit. Pressure distribution inside the effective pore is related to the number of the exit slit which connect with the pore. More exit slits means bigger pressure inside the effective pore. In addition, if asphalt membranes at exit slits have micro-cracking, the cumulative damage could appear easily and asphalt membranes could be peeled easily. Finally, a test was conducted so as to obtain the bonding strength and adhesion strength between asphalt and aggregate. Then, we can get accurate damage form and position during the scour process by comparing the numerical simulation results with experiment results.}

abstract = {Abstract Hemming is a three-step sheet-folding process utilized in the production of automotive closures. It has a critical imact on the performance and perceived quality of assembled vehicles. Using a two-dimensional finite element model, this paper presents a design-of-experiments (DOE) study of the relationships between important hemming process parameters and hem quality for aluminium alloy AA 6111-T4PD flat surface-straight edge hemming. The quality measures include roll-in/roll-out of the hem edge as well as the maximum true strain on the exposed bent surface. The finite element (FE) model combines explicit and implicit procedures in simulating the three forming subprocesses (flanging, pre-hemming, and final hemming) along with the corresponding springback (unloading). The results show that the pre-hemming die angle and the flanging die radius have the greatest influence on hem edge roll-in/roll-out, while pre-strain and the flanging die radius impact the maximum surface strain significantly. The computational DOE results also provide the basis for process parameter selection to avoid hem surface cracking and particular insights for achieving acceptable formability.}

abstract = {We perform a socio-computational interrogation of the google search by image algorithm, a main component of the google search engine. We audit the algorithm by presenting it with more than 40 thousands faces of all ages and more than four races and collecting and analyzing the assigned labels with the appropriate statistical tools. We find that the algorithm reproduces white male patriarchal structures, often simplifying, stereotyping and discriminating females and non-white individuals, while providing more positive descriptions of white men. By drawing from Bourdieu’s theory of cultural reproduction, we link these results to the attitudes of the algorithm’s designers, owners, and the dataset the algorithm was trained on. We further underpin the problematic nature of the algorithm by using the ethnographic practice of studying-up: We show how the algorithm places individuals at the top of the tech industry within the socio-cultural reality that they shaped, many times creating biased representations of them. We claim that the use of social-theoretic frameworks such as the above are able to contribute to improved algorithmic accountability, algorithmic impact assessment and provide additional and more critical depth in algorithmic bias and auditing studies. Based on the analysis, we discuss the scientific and design implications and provide suggestions for alternative ways to design just socio-algorithmic systems.}

abstract = {This research article aims to describe how the confluence of financial economics, mathematics and computational technologies can prove to be so effective in the practice of financial engineering. As per modern demands, financial derivatives constitute a vast and rapidly growing portion of the global financial markets. The tool is being used exponentially in portfolio management and for hedging purposes and thus, strong efforts have been projected on modelling of derivative products. In addition, this research article also addresses one of the major problems of pricing European plain vanilla options namely the constant volatility assumption of the Black-Scholes model concentrating the volatility of the underlying assets. Since pricing bias emerges as the most dominant feature of Black-Scholes whenever applied with options and this is the main cause why Black-Scholes model is not widely operated upon in pricing of complex non-vanilla options. However, despite the pricing bias problem, amid its simplicity the Black-Scholes framework dominates the pricing of European style options traded on exchanges, since its inception. The issue of eliminating the price bias has already occupied a huge space in previous published literature of this stream, thus instead of focusing on the price bias of Black-Scholes this work is an attempt to resolve and suggest some of the finest solutions of the financial mathematics to overcome this complex problem of option pricing.}

abstract = {For large-scale wireless sensor networks, the nonlinear localization problem where only neighboring distances are available to each individual sensor nodes have been attracting great research attention. In general, distributed algorithms for this problem are likely to suffer from the failures that localizations are trapped in local minima. Focusing on this issue, this article considers a fully distributed algorithm by introducing a novel mechanism, where each individual node is allowed to computationally interact with a random subset of its neighbors, for helping localizations escape from local minima. Theoretical analyses reveal that with the proposed algorithm, any local minimum of the localization will be unstable, and the global optimum would finally be achieved with probability 1 after enough time of iterations. Numerical simulations are given as well to demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.}

QSARs and related models attempt to associate physicochemical and structural properties of compounds to their biological activity. As such, they may permit the prediction of biological activity from chemical structure alone. As yet, no formal validation criteria have been agreed internationally for QSARs and related techniques. However, some general and preliminary criteria were discussed and agreed upon at a European Chemical Industry Council/International Council of Chemical Associations (CEFIC/ICCA) workshop on the regulatory acceptance of QSARs, held in Setubal, Portugal, in March 2002. These criteria were presented at a Fourth World Congress workshop, along with a proposal for the practical validation of computer models, such as QSARs.}
