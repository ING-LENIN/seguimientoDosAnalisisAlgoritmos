N2 - This paper evaluates with numerical computations the respective merits of two competing notions of coalition stability in the standard global public goods model of climate change. To this effect it uses the CWS integrated assessment model. After a reminder of the two game theoretical stability notions involved—core-stability and internal-external stability—and of the CWS model, the former property is shown to hold for the grand coalition if resource transfers of a specific form between countries are introduced. The latter property appears to hold neither for the grand coalition nor for most large coalitions whereas it is verified for most small coalitions in a weak sense that involves transfers. Finally, coalitions, stable in either sense, that perform best in terms of carbon concentration and global welfare are always heterogeneous ones. Therefore, if coalitional stability is taken as an objective, promoting small or homogeneous coalitions is not to be recommended.

N2 - Three-way junctions in folded RNAs have been investigated both experimentally and computationally. The interest in their analysis stems from the fact that they have significantly been found to possess a functional role. In recent work, three-way junctions have been categorized into families depending on the relative lengths of the segments linking the three helices. Here, based on ideas originating from computational geometry, an algorithm is proposed for detecting three-way junctions in data sets of genes that are related to a metabolic pathway of interest. In its current implementation, the algorithm relies on a moving window that performs energy minimization folding predictions, and is demonstrated on a set of genes that are involved in purine metabolism in plants. The pattern matching algorithm can be extended to other organisms and other metabolic cycles of interest in which three-way junctions have been or will be discovered to play an important role. In the test case presented here with, the computational prediction of a three-way junction in Arabidopsis that was speculated to have an interesting functional role is verified experimentally.

N2 - The effects of different loading programs on the elasto-/viscoplastic behavior of rate-sensitive materials are analyzed with specific numerical examples. An appropriate solution scheme and a consistent tangent operator are applied which are capable of being adopted for general computational procedures. Numerical computations and results are reported which illustrate the rate-dependence of the elasto-/viscoplastic constitutive model in use. In the numerical analysis the loading is applied by increasing the pressure and accordingly a nondimensional loading program parameter is introduced. In the numerical results the significance of the loading program is thus emphasized with reference to the nonlinear response of the elasto-/viscoplastic material behavior of solids.

N2 - This study, which was reviewed through the Registered Report process, examined the initial efficacy of the Scientific Explorers program (Sci2) on second-grade students’ science achievement. Sci2 is grounded in the growing body of empirical research on science instruction, embedding principles of explicit instruction within a guided inquiry-based design framework. Eighteen second-grade classrooms were randomly assigned to treatment or control conditions. A cluster randomized controlled trial was employed, with 294 students nested within classrooms and classrooms nested within condition. The Sci2 program was implemented for a total of 10 lessons (5 hr) in treatment classrooms, whereas control classrooms provided business-as-usual science instruction. Overall treatment effects were observed on three of four science outcome measures. The reported effects were moderate to large, with effect sizes (Hedges’ g) ranging from 0.48 to 0.94. Moderation analyses indicated that science knowledge at pretest did not moderate Sci2’s effects. Implications for practice and research are discussed.

N2 - This article analyses collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), complex securities that were at the heart of the recent financial crisis. The difficulties of analysing these securities are considered, and it is argued that the increasing complexity of CDOs that repackaged mortgage-backed securities outpaced the returns available to investors, and therefore the resources available to pay for the analysis required to value the securities adequately within the timeframe available. CDOs therefore faced the problem of computational intractability. Such an outcome was, the article argues, inevitable in financial innovation that sought to create ever-higher returns from the fixed returns on a pool of assets. CDOs created what the article labels a lemon-squeezing problem. Implications for regulatory responses to the crisis are briefly explored.

N2 - Reliable and robust computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solvers are nowadays commonly utilized in the design and analyses of various engineering systems, such as aircraft, turbomachinery, ships, and automotives. Although this has resulted in a drastic decrease of the number of prototype and experimental testing, the use of CFD in the design automation process is still limited. In practice, the geometry parameters that ensure satisfaction of assumed performance requirements are often obtained by repetitive CFD simulations guided by engineering experience. This is a tedious process which does not guarantee optimal results. On the other hand, straightforward automation attempts by employing the CFD solvers directly in the optimization loop are typically impractical, even when using adjoint sensitivity information, because high-fidelity CFD simulations tend to be computationally very expensive. In this paper, we describe a surrogate-based design optimization methodology that shifts the computational burden from the accurate and expensive high-fidelity CFD model to its fast and yet reasonably accurate surrogate. As the surrogate models are computationally much cheaper than the high-fidelity ones, the cost of the design process is greatly reduced. Here, the surrogates are constructed using low-fidelity CFD models and response correction techniques. Application examples, involving the design of axisymmetric hulls in subsonic flow, and airfoils in both subsonic and transonic flows, are presented.

N2 - This mixed-method study introduced an adaptive scaffolding system to support middle school science problem-based learning (PBL) activities. 298 6th-graders were grouped into three conditions, which are the adaptive scaffolding group, the non-adaptive scaffolding group, and a control group that did not receive any scaffoldings. Results showed that problem-solving self-efficacy for students who engaged with the adaptive scaffolding system had improved significantly compared to the other two groups. Moreover, since students were conducting the PBL activity under two modes (online and in-person), the results also showed that students in the online mode gained more science content knowledge compared to their peers in the in-person mode after engaging with the adaptive system. Student interviews revealed that the real-time supports and in-time feedback provided by the adaptive system were the key elements that facilitated their improvements, teacher interviews presented that the adaptive system provided effective assists for teachers to facilitate the PBL activities.

N2 - In the Institute of Thermal Turbomachinery (ITSM) at Stuttgart University, a three-stage model steam turbine was used to study the complex steam flow through the last stages of low pressure steam turbines. The conditions in this test rig were such that condensation occurred after the first stage, so that wet steam was prevalent in the last stage. In order to determine the inlet conditions for the last stage and for the validation of results of a numerical simulation of the condensing steam flow through the model turbine, both steam quality and the droplet size spectrum were measured in front of the stator of the last stage using a miniature combined optical/pneumatic probe. However, while the measured steam quality matched the numerical results quite well, there were considerable differences between the computed and the measured droplet size spectrum. The latter showed considerably larger droplets than predicted by computational fluid dynamics. In this paper, the measurement principle (light extinction) is presented and the inherent limitations for the determination of very small droplets with diameters of less than 0.2 µm are discussed. Issues related to this challenge are the availability of UV-wavelengths and the optical length used for the measurements. The reliability of the inversion algorithm used to analyse the light extinction data is shown by comparison with data from experiments using polystyrene suspensions with known particle size and concentration. Thereafter, the validity of the measurement results is reassessed based on numerical results and data from repeated measurements. It can be shown that the experimental results are reliable, implying that the numerical results suffer from inaccuracies. Apart from modelling issues, one reason for this could be that the inherent unsteadiness in turbine flows is neglected in steady computational fluid dynamics computations.
