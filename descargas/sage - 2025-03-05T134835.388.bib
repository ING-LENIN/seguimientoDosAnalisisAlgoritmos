abstract = {Edith Ackermann was one of the most important scholars in the interdisciplinary field of Child-Computer Interaction. Trained as a developmental psychologist and having worked with Jean Piaget in Switzerland, Ackermann went to MIT in 1985 to join an intrepid group of researchers led by Seymour Papert who were trying to understand how extant theories of development and learning would fare in a world in which children would be surrounded by computational artefacts. For the ensuing three decades, Ackermann would use her unique interdisciplinary expertise in the service of creating new theories of development for this new world, generating cutting-edge research, inspiring a generation of students, and producing seminal papers. This article, making use of literature as well as interviews with colleagues of Edith, discusses Ackermann’s contribution to the field, her life trajectory, impact, and ideas. Edith passed away on 24 December 2016.}

abstract = {Purpose There is limited scholarship on artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education governance, despite the growing prevalence of AI-powered technologies in many fields, including education. However, as the technology is still nascent and has yet to reach its full potential, ideas and arguments abound, championing or cautioning against the use of these technologies. Design/Approach/Methods To fill this gap in research on policy networks and AI in British higher education, this article employs network ethnography and discourse analysis to study how ideas about AI-powered technologies in higher education circulate in policy networks in the United Kingdom. Findings The findings evidence a policy network showing signs of a heterarchy permeated by neoliberal rationales and populated by policy actors actively promoting artificial intelligence technologies to be used in education. Originality/Value This paper builds on existing research by looking at the university and not-for-profit sectors, in addition to the governmental and educational technology sectors. Using network ethnography, this article expands our understanding of the policy actors involved and critically analyzes ideas regarding the use of AI in education.}

abstract = {With the advent of Industry 4.0, future workspaces are expected to evolve in tandem with technological advances in industry and education. Industry 4.0 calls for transformation and effective talent development is vital in ensuring national aspirations are achieved while eliminating redundancy and ensuring consistency. As such, this study aims to understand the impact of Industry 4.0 on computer engineering-related workforce and skills development within Multinational Companies (MNCs) to Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia. In this study, online questionnaires were distributed to evaluate the current and future hiring trends. The study reveals that most of the employees have positive perceptions about the industrial current practice on Industry 4.0 and identified the prospective demands on the professions that will be affected. Five significant areas of required competencies found in this study are adaptability, soft skills, software engineering, data analytics, and technical skills. The findings provide empirical evidence about current and future employment scenarios in Malaysia concerning the possible impact of Industry 4.0 on the companies and issues involved in managing the transition to Industry 4.0. Besides, the emergent skills required by workforces that are previously unaddressed in the literature were identified. Empirical evidence from the analysis contributes to shaping the educational systems of the future and helps to proactively identify specific skills shortages at an early stage.}

abstract = {Compared with the traditional in-cylinder direct-injection spark ignition engine, the side-injection and side-spark-ignition characteristics of the two-stroke opposed-piston engine increase the ignition kernel offset and flame propagation distance. Increasing the flame propagation speed can to some extent solve the drawbacks caused by the non-central arrangement of spark plugs. The combustion chamber structure plays a crucial role in gas flow, fuel-charge mixing, and combustion characteristics. Therefore, three pistons were designed and comparatively analyzed in this study. The results show that: The pancake piston is beneficial to maintaining the intake swirl strength due to its simple and smooth spherical arc structure. The swirl strength of the pit and pit-guided piston decreases obviously, and the tumble strength can be maintained well. Compared to pancake and pit-guided pistons, the average TKE for the pit piston increased by approximately 25%, with a more concentrated distribution at the spark timing. The pancake piston exhibits the best scavenging performance, reducing the residual exhaust gas ratio by 2.1% and fresh air loss by 3.3% to the pit piston. A stable ignition core can be formed at the spark timing, but significant differences are observed in the flame propagation process for three pistons. Compared to the pit-guided piston, the pit piston has a 0.3% decrease in the indicated thermal efficiency, but a 13.1% decrease in combustion duration, which reduces knock tendency.}
