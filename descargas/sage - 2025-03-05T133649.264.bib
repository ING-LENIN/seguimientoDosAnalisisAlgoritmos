N2 - This article presents a computational simulation framework developed to capture the ratcheting response of dented straight pipes. The results are compared against the results obtained from our previously conducted experiments. Ratcheting occurs when a structure is subjected to a primary axial load along with a secondary cyclic load, provided that the applied loads are sufficiently large in magnitude to cause the material to yield. The dented pipes investigated in this study were initially subjected to a monotonic axial compression load, which caused the initiation of small amplitude wrinkles, and were subsequently subjected to an axial cyclic loading regime. A nonlinear finite element analysis, using a combined hardening model, was adopted to model the response of the material during the entire loading regime. The parameters required by the material model were obtained from cyclic tests conducted on representative coupon specimens. The results of the numerical simulations were compared to experimentally obtained data. The results demonstrated that the ratcheting response of dented pipes could be numerically simulated with a reasonable accuracy. The results also revealed that the surface imperfections exerted a very pronounced effect on the ratcheting response of the dented pipes. The computational model was also used to investigate the influence of some key parameters, such as the initial strain level, stress amplitude, mean stress, loading regime, and material hardening properties, on the resulting ratcheting.

N2 - A micromechanical model was established based on the fluid dynamics theory. This model could be used to calculate several kinds of data when the asphalt pavement under the influence of traffic loading is in water-saturated condition. The results showed that the maximum pressure inside the effective pore was located at the junction between exit slits and the pore wall. There was a positive correlation between the pressure and the vehicle speed. Therefore, the repeated traffic loading could cause emulsification, shift and even peeling of the asphalt membrane. Moreover, the bigger size of the exit slit is, the higher velocity of the fluid has. The high velocity flow keeps scouring both the exit slit and the lower boundary of pore wall. It will cause a bigger slit. Pressure distribution inside the effective pore is related to the number of the exit slit which connect with the pore. More exit slits means bigger pressure inside the effective pore. In addition, if asphalt membranes at exit slits have micro-cracking, the cumulative damage could appear easily and asphalt membranes could be peeled easily. Finally, a test was conducted so as to obtain the bonding strength and adhesion strength between asphalt and aggregate. Then, we can get accurate damage form and position during the scour process by comparing the numerical simulation results with experiment results.

N2 - Interstitial photodynamic therapy has shown promising results in the treatment of locally advanced head and neck cancer. In this therapy, systemic administration of a light-sensitive drug is followed by insertion of multiple laser fibers to illuminate the tumor and its margins. Image-based pretreatment planning is employed in order to deliver a sufficient light dose to the complex locally advanced head-and-neck cancer anatomy, in order to meet clinical requirements. Unfortunately, the tumor may deform between pretreatment imaging for the purpose of planning and intraoperative imaging when the plan is executed. Tumor deformation may result from the mechanical forces applied by the light fibers and variation of the patient’s posture. Pretreatment planning is frequently done with the assistance of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging in an outpatient suite, while treatment monitoring and control typically uses ultrasound imaging due to considerations of costs and availability in the operation room. This article presents a computational method designed to bridge the gap between the 2 imaging events by taking a tumor geometry, reconstructed during preplanning, and by following the displacement of fiducial markers, which are initially placed during the preplanning procedure. The deformed tumor shape is predicted by solving an inverse problem, seeking for the forces that would have resulted in the corresponding fiducial marker displacements. The computational method is studied on spheres of variable sizes and demonstrated on computed tomography reconstructed locally advanced head and neck cancer model. Results of this study demonstrate an average error of less than 1 mm in predicting the deformed tumor shape, where 1 mm is typically the order of uncertainty in distance measurements using magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography imaging and high-quality ultrasound imaging. This study further demonstrates that the deformed shape can be calculated in a few seconds, making the proposed method clinically relevant.

N2 - From their common roots in Human Factors Engineering, Human-Centered Design and Cognitive Systems Engineering have drifted into distinct fields over the past three decades, each developing beneficial heuristics, design patterns, and evaluation methods for designing for individuals and teams, respectively. GeoHAI, a clinical decision support application for preventing hospital-acquired infection, has yielded positive results in early usability testing and is expected to test positively in supporting joint activity, which will be measured through the novel implementation of Joint Activity Monitoring . The design and implementation of this application provide a demonstration of the possibilities and necessities to unify the work of Human-Centered Design and Cognitive Systems Engineering when designing technologies that are usable and useful to individuals engaged in joint activity with machine counterparts and other people. We are calling this unified process Joint Activity Design, which supports designing for machines to be good team players.

N2 - We present a computational model of learned avoidance behavior in a one-way avoidance experiment. Our model employs the reinforcement learning paradigm and a temporal-difference algorithm to implement both classically conditioned and instrumentally conditioned components. The role of the classically conditioned component is to develop an expectation of future benefit that is a function of the learning system’s state and action. Competition among the instrumentally conditioned components determines the overt behavior generated by the learning system. Our model displays, in simulation, the reduced latency of the avoidance behavior during learning with continuing trials and the resistance to extinction of the avoidance response. These results are consistent with experimentally observed animal behavior. Our model extends the traditional two-process learning mechanism of Mowrer by explicitly defining the mechanisms of proprioceptive feedback, an internal clock, and generalization over the action space.

N2 - Replication is a critical element of the scientific process. This article is an effort to contribute to the slowly growing literature concerning the replication of agent-based computational models. We present a replication of Kollman, Miller, and Page’s model of Tiebout sorting. In that model, individual agents with heterogeneous preferences for government policies select among jurisdictions that offer the most satisfactory package of government services. This project makes three contributions to the literature. First, our successful replication provides the research community with a modernized version of that seminal model. Second, we confirm that earlier results with respect to the single jurisdiction setting are highly robust with respect to voter preferences, while the results for multiple jurisdiction settings are more sensitive. Finally, we demonstrate a technique for conducting sensitivity analyses that leverages a high-dimensional experimental design.

N2 - A realistic model of the left ventricle of the heart was previously constructed, using a cast from a dog heart which was in diastole. Previous studies of the three-dimensional heart model were conducted in systole only. The purpose of this investigation was to extend the model to both systole and diastole, and to determine what the effect of a previous cardiac cycle was on the next cardiac cycle. The 25.8 cc ventricular volume was reduced by 40% in 0.25 seconds, then increased to the original volume in another 0.25 seconds and then allowed to rest for 0.25 seconds. Runs done with an ejection fraction of 60% showed little variation from one cardiac cycle to another after the third cardiac cycle was completed; the maximum velocity could vary by over 30% between the first and second cardiac cycles. In systole, centerline and cross-sectional velocity vectors greatly increased in magnitude at the aortic outlet. Most of the pressure drop occurred in the top 15% of the heart. The diastolic phase showed complex vortex formation not seen in the systolic contractions; these complex vortices could account for experimentally observed turbulent blood flow fluctuations in the aorta.
