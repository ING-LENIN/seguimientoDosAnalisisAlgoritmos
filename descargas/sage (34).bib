abstract = {The abstraction of cryptographic operations by term algebras, called Dolev–Yao models, is essential in almost all tool-supported methods for proving security protocols. Recently significant progress was made in proving that Dolev–Yao models offering the core cryptographic operations such as encryption and digital signatures can be sound with respect to actual cryptographic realizations and security definitions. Recent work, however, has started to extend Dolev–Yao models to more sophisticated operations with unique security features. Zero-knowledge proofs arguably constitute the most amazing such extension. In this paper, we first identify which additional properties a cryptographic (non-interactive) zero-knowledge proof needs to fulfill in order to serve as a computationally sound implementation of symbolic (Dolev–Yao style) zero-knowledge proofs; this leads to the novel definition of a symbolically-sound zero-knowledge proof system. We prove that even in the presence of arbitrary active adversaries, such proof systems constitute computationally sound implementations of symbolic zero-knowledge proofs. This yields the first computational soundness result for symbolic zero-knowledge proofs and the first such result against fully active adversaries of Dolev–Yao models that go beyond the core cryptographic operations.}

abstract = {This article considers the issue of opacity as a problem for socially consequential mechanisms of classification and ranking, such as spam filters, credit card fraud detection, search engines, news trends, market segmentation and advertising, insurance or loan qualification, and credit scoring. These mechanisms of classification all frequently rely on computational algorithms, and in many cases on machine learning algorithms to do this work. In this article, I draw a distinction between three forms of opacity: (1) opacity as intentional corporate or state secrecy, (2) opacity as technical illiteracy, and (3) an opacity that arises from the characteristics of machine learning algorithms and the scale required to apply them usefully. The analysis in this article gets inside the algorithms themselves. I cite existing literatures in computer science, known industry practices (as they are publicly presented), and do some testing and manipulation of code as a form of lightweight code audit. I argue that recognizing the distinct forms of opacity that may be coming into play in a given application is a key to determining which of a variety of technical and non-technical solutions could help to prevent harm.}

abstract = {Abstract Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) probably plays a greater part in the aerodynamic design of turbomachinery than it does in any other engineering application. For many years the design of a modern turbine or compressor has been unthinkable without the help of CFD and this dependence has increased as more of the flow becomes amenable to numerical prediction. The benefits of CFD range from shorter design cycles to better performance and reduced costs and weight. This paper presents a review of the main CFD methods in use, discusses their advantages and limitations and points out where further developments are required. The paper is concerned with the application of CFD and does not describe the numerical methods or turbulence modelling in any detail.}

abstract = {The complex nature of the tire/road noise generation process makes it difficult to isolate and study each mechanism individually. This paper presents an experimental and numerical investigation of air-borne tire noise generation mechanisms for a realistic tire. Experimentally, a single slot is cut into the tire and the noise data are measured and studied. Air-borne noise is isolated by filling the slot with foam and comparing the resulting frequency spectra. Numerically, a previously developed computational fluid dynamics tire noise prediction model is employed to predict the air-borne noise for the same tire, under similar operating conditions. A direct comparison between the experimental and computational results is also presented in terms of pressure time traces and spectral characteristics. Comparisons indicate that the computational model is capable of predicting the noise generated by the air pockets in the tire. While providing a deeper understanding of the causes of air-borne noise, this paper also aims to demonstrate the use of a computational tool that can be used to obtain a reasonably accurate prediction of air-borne tire noise.}

abstract = {During the last few years a growing amount of content produced by Internet users has become publicly available online. These data come from a variety of places, including popular social web services like Facebook and Twitter, consumer services like Amazon or weblogs. The research opportunities opened up by this socio-technological innovation are, as shown by the growing literature on the topic, huge. At the same time new challenges for social scientists arise. In this paper we will focus on two of the main challenges posed to the growth of the so-called computational social science: interdisciplinarity and ethics. While the searchability and persistence of this information make it ideal for sociological research, a quantitative approach is still challenging because of the size and complexity of the data. Collecting, storing and analyzing these data often require technical skills beyond the traditional curricula of social scientists. These projects require, in fact, collaboration with computer scientists. Nevertheless developing a common interdisciplinary project is often challenging because of the different backgrounds of the researchers. At the same time the availability of this content poses a challenge concerning privacy and research ethics. Due to the amount of data and the fact that the real identity of the author is often hidden behind a nickname, it is often impossible to ask the subject involved to consent to the use of their data. On the other hand, especially in the first wave of web 2.0, this information has been – intentionally or not – publicly shared by the users. While a technique of dis-embedding the identity of the user from the content analyzed is often the solution used to bypass this issue, an even more important privacy-related challenge for computational social science is emerging. Due to the wide adoption of social network sites such Facebook or Google+, where a user may decide to share his content with his/her group of friends only, the amount of public data will change and decrease in the future. We will discuss this issue by enumerating a number of possible future scenarios.}

abstract = {A three-dimensional computational model is established to simulate the air flow patterns in the rotor spinning unit of a rotor spinning machine. The effects of rotor speed, rotor diameter and rotor slide wall angle on air flow characteristics and hence yarn properties are investigated. The airstream accelerates from the transfer channel inlet to the outlet. There are velocity differences in both the cross-section and along the transfer channel, causing hooked fibers to straighten. The airstream swirls around the rotor at a high speed. However, vortices that can cause fiber curving and buckling are formed inside the rotor. The effect of rotor speed is significant. There are more vortices near the wall at a lower rotor speed, while too large a rotor speed can lead to an excessive centrifugal force, thus increasing yarn breakages. The rotor diameter affects the flow characteristics in a way similar to that of rotor speed. As a smaller slide wall angle generates higher velocities in the transfer channel and more stable velocities in the rotor groove, a small angle is preferable. Computational modeling has provided a useful insight into the rotor spinning flow pattern, thus it can be used to optimize the rotor design to produce better rotor spun yarn.}

abstract = {In recent years, the computational fluid dynamics method has developed into very useful tools for investigating the oil flow and the no-load losses in geared transmissions. It has neither restriction on the housing shape nor limitations on the lubrication configuration. For this work, a computational fluid dynamics method model based on the finite volume method of a single-stage, injection-lubricated gearbox was built. The influence of different parameters including the injection volume, oil viscosity, and gear speed on the oil supply and distribution were investigated. The results also include a comparison of the simulated no-load losses with empirical no-load loss equations. This work provides first results on computational fluid dynamics method investigations of injection-lubricated geared transmissions and a starting point for comprehensive validation and more complex modeling.}

abstract = {Objective: We developed a computational model of the effects of sleep deprivation on the vigilance decrement by employing the methods of system dynamics modeling. Background: Situations that require sustained attention for a prolonged duration can cause a decline in cognitive performance, the so-called vigilance decrement. One factor that should influence the vigilance decrement is fatigue in the form of sleep deprivation. Method: We employed the methods of system dynamics modeling (numerical-integration techniques for modeling complex feedback systems) to create a computational model of the vigilance decrement. We then simulated the computational effects of sleep deprivation on the behavior of that model, using empirical data obtained from the literature for calibrating such effects. Results: Sleep deprivation of 2 hr over a 14-day period should produce an additional decline of 9% in detection performance over that found with the typical vigilance decrement, whereas 4 hr of sleep deprivation over 14 days should produce an additional decline of 14% in detection performance. Conclusion: With respect to dual-process theory, it is through its deleterious effects on analytical cognition that sleep deprivation should impact the vigilance decrement. Application: Such computational modeling may be advantageous for human-machine teaming by theoretically allowing a future autonomous software agent to anticipate the decline of human performance and compensate accordingly.}

abstract = {Computational photography is currently altering the representational and social functions of photographic imaging. A range of heavily automated computational processing techniques produce images that remediate digital photography to circumvent physical limitations associated with the size of smartphones, emulating the aesthetics associated with larger format digital cameras and professional photographic workflows and practices. These processes include automated compositing where images seen by users are constituted of up to 15 individual frames, the simulation of a shallow depth-of-field, automated facial retouching and even providing automated assistance to suggest alternative frames within the image stream to serve as the base image. This article explores these emerging techniques and accompanying claims that such processes are radically transforming photographic practice. While the extent and modes of automation and algorithmic processing depart from prior practices, contextualising them within the histories of photographic compositing and the algorithmic malleability of digital photography suggests the intensification of existing trends rather than an epistemic break. Furthermore, exploring the representational politics of automated facial retouching and the datafication of images situates these changes within the broader social context of dataveillance and platform capitalism.}
