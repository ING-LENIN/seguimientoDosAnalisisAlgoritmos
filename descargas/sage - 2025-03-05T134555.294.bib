abstract = {This paper argues that analyses of the ways in which Big Data has been enacted in other academic disciplines can provide us with concepts that will help understand the application of Big Data to social questions. We use examples drawn from our Science and Technology Studies (STS) analyses of -omic biology and high energy physics to demonstrate the utility of three theoretical concepts: (i) primary and secondary inscriptions, (ii) crafted and found data, and (iii) the locus of legitimate interpretation. These help us to show how the histories, organisational forms, and power dynamics of a field lead to different enactments of big data. The paper suggests that these concepts can be used to help us to understand the ways in which Big Data is being enacted in the domain of the social sciences, and to outline in general terms the ways in which this enactment might be different to that which we have observed in the ‘hard’ sciences. We contend that the locus of legitimate interpretation of Big Data biology and physics is tightly delineated, found within the disciplinary institutions and cultures of these disciplines. We suggest that when using Big Data to make knowledge claims about ‘the social’ the locus of legitimate interpretation is more diffuse, with knowledge claims that are treated as being credible made from other disciplines, or even by those outside academia entirely.}

abstract = {The computational metaphor of organisms as phenotypic automata controlled by a genetic programme has been replaced by the cognitive metaphor of organisms as intelligent agents making decisions about how to use their genomic and environmental resources. This metaphor facilitates novel ways of thinking about organisms that defy the assumptions of the old machine metaphor. But like all metaphors, the cognitive metaphor discloses important similarities at the expense of eclipsing significant dissimilarities. I argue that although cognitivism carries with it the crucial insight that living organisms are agents rather than mere automata, this metaphor distorts the nature of biological agency by over-intellectualizing, which risks eliminating the distinction between life and mind. I trace the Cartesian root of these metaphors and argue that it generates a dilemma between mechanism and intellectualism. To capture the middle path that most organisms occupy between these two extremes, I propose an ecological account of natural agency.}

abstract = {Objective Digital pathology (DP) is moving into Danish pathology departments at high pace. Conventionally, biomedical laboratory scientists (BLS) and technicians have prepared tissue sections for light microscopy, but workflow alterations are required for the new digital era with whole slide imaging (WSI); digitally assisted image analysis (DAIA) and artificial intelligence (AI). We aim to explore the role of BLS in DP and assess a potential need for professional development. Methods We investigated the roles of BLS in the new digital era through qualitative interviews at Danish Pathology Departments in 2019/2020 before DP implementation (supported by a questionnaire); and in 2022 after DP implementation. Additionally, senior lecturers from three Danish University Colleges reported on how DP was integrated into the 2023 bachelor’s degree educational curricula for BLS students. Results At some Danish pathology departments, BLS were involved in the implementation process of DP and their greatest concerns were lack of physical laboratory requirements (69%) and implementation strategies (63%). BLS were generally positive towards working with DP, however, some expressed concern about extended working hours for scanning. Work-task transfers from pathologists were generally greeted positively from both management and pathologists; however, at follow-up interviews after DP implementation, job transfers had not been effectuated. At Danish university colleges, DP had been integrated systematically in the curricula for BLS students, especially WSI. Conclusion Involving BLS in DP implementation and development may benefit the process, as BLS have a hands-on workflow perspective with a focus on quality assurance. Several new work opportunities for BLS may occur with DP including WSI, DAIA and AI, and therefore new qualifications are warranted, which must be considered in future undergraduate programmes for BLS students or postgraduate programmes for BLS.}

abstract = {The article attempts to locate the role of the computer in the long-standing conflict between the humanities on one side and the hard sciences and mathematics on the other. The state-sponsored promotion of philosophy and its subsequent demotion of scientific explanations provoked a scientific counter-attack, in the course of which psychophysical research subjected the human perception apparatus to rigorous investigations that all but mechanized the faculties of human understanding that were so central to the aspirations of philosophers. The latter retaliated either by creating realms such as Husserl’s phenomenological ‘life-world’ that preceded, and hence were immune to, psychophysical explanations of sensation and perception, or by universalizing the faculty of understanding in such a way as to ensure the importance and competence of philosophy (e.g., in the work of the early Heidegger). This ongoing antagonism was also present in the ways in which the parties treated media technology: Philosophy tried to constrain media by conceptualizing them as obedient instruments tools at the beck and call of their users, whereas psychophysical research modeled the human mind on the very media that were indispensable for accessing this mind in the first place. The former saw media as ‘handy’ tools, the latter proceeded to make them the very measure of man. Alan Turing’s universal machine puts an end to this struggle: Not only does it blur the distinction between instructions and data, it converts the materials of the real world, the mechanisms of the mind, and the principal bastion of philosophy, natural languages, into numbers.}

abstract = {Drawing upon the growing datafication of contemporary schooling, our purpose in this article is to use topological thinking as an analytical device to better understand the professionals and practices within emergent data infrastructures. We address this by attending to an influential national (and subnational) data infrastructure of school monitoring in the United States, managed by the federal Department of Education, known as EDFacts. Informed by policy documents relating to EDFacts, as well as by various related software platforms and portals, we explore the whom and how of datafication, and expose the increasing presence and influence of otherwise ‘hidden’ technology mediators, or ‘shadow professionals’. In particular, we argue that the increasing dependency of EDFacts on data has necessitated the introduction of new professional roles associated with optimising the flow of data, and thus stabilising and normalising the topological space of the infrastructure. We conclude by suggesting that EDFacts encourages teaching professionals and shadow professionals alike to engage in acts of data submission; that is, providing data to EDFacts and, at the same time, positioning themselves as wholly responsive to the infrastructure and its datafied renderings of schooling.}

abstract = {This research study investigates US middle school students’ collaborative information-seeking, sense-making and knowledge-building practices in a guided discovery-based programme of game design learning in which students and their teachers participate in a formal, in-school class daily, for credit and a grade for an entire year. The learning is supported by information affordances including a wiki learning management system (LMS) housing the curriculum, organized design activities, social media features, tutorials and informational assignments. Students engage in a Constructionist blended learning setting in their classroom, and work collaboratively in teams on game design. The study draws on qualitative video data from six team cases using a coding scheme of categories for the concepts of task, collaborative information seeking (CIS) Modality, and inquiry resolution outcomes. The study also considers linkages between processes and learning outcomes. Variation in engagement across the categories among students was charted, and certain patterns emerged. Findings indicate that some categories of task appear related to some categories of students’ chosen CIS Modality for solving problems. Further, CIS processes in support of tasks appear related to inquiry incident resolution (resolved/unresolved). For student completion of advanced programming tasks in particular, we observe more frequent uses of the wiki-based LMS resources, and greater levels of challenge in fulfilling tasks. Results support existing work on these theoretical constructs in the information sciences, and lead to questions on how naturalistic emergence of CIS practices result from greater task knowledge, and whether learned CIS practices (as tasks in and of themselves) can yield project task knowledge gains. Findings of the study and the ongoing questions the work invites hold instructional design implications, and show how social constructivist educational contexts involving collaborative and information seeking and knowledge building among youth game designers can contribute to scholarly understanding of these processes more broadly in related project-based work contexts occurring among both youth and adults.}

abstract = {Nitrogen oxides are considered as one of the greenhouse gases. Among the most significant emission sources for this gas is a natural gas-fired power plant. The United Nations General assembly suggested in 1988 that human activities can negatively impact weather patterns, and thus they should be controlled. This control policy can improve the efficiency of final consumers such as power plants, cars, or other energy-intensive industries. In this paper, the existing strategies and explicitly making the dry low nitrogen oxides burner reduce greenhouse gases in power plants are explored. The geometry of the burner has been produced in a three-dimensional form in GAMBIT software, and the results of the simulation have been expressed through FLUENT software. Contours of pressure, temperature, and velocity of the fluid in the furnace are also derived. It is concluded that the dry low nitrogen oxides burners plan has a better result compared with other strategies.}
