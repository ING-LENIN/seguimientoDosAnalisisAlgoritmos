In many real-world applications, it is important to identify and treat the outliers without direct elimination. To handle such issues, a hybrid computational method based on conic quadratic programming is introduced and employed on earthquake ground motion dataset. This method aims to minimize the impact of the outliers on regression estimators as well as handling the nonlinearity in the dataset. Results are compared against widely used parametric and nonparametric ground motion prediction models.

N2 - Many students with learning disabilities (LD) in mathematics receive their mathematics education in general education inclusive classes; therefore, these students must be capable of learning algebraic concepts, including developing algebraic thinking abilities, that are part of the general education curriculum. To help students develop algebraic thinking, teachers should ask questions in different ways to promote the ability to think algebraically. This article describes three types of questions—reversibility, flexibility, and generalizations—which support the acquisition of broader concepts leading to algebraic thinking. Examples of the question types within the contexts of rational numbers and integers are provided to assist teachers in creating similar questions for teaching mathematics to students with LD.

N2 - Using the test scores of more than 1,000,000 students who participated in the Advanced Placement Computer Science (AP CS) exams from 1997 to 2020, this study examined the direction and magnitude of the trends in gender disparity in participation and top achievement in advanced exams. The findings indicated that the male-to-female ratio (MFR) among AP Computer Science (CS) exam participants declined from 4.87 to 2.26 between 1997 and 2020. Similarly, the MFR among top scorers (students who scored 5 out of 5) in any type of AP CS exams declined rapidly, in favor of female students, from 8.00 to 2.14 during the same period. Possible implications of these findings for educators, particularly for AP CS teachers and school counselors, were also discussed in the context of the underrepresentation of females in computing fields.

N2 - This article examines how the ‘refugee crisis’, sparked by the arrival of refugees from the Syrian civil war and other conflicts around the world, was articulated across Dutch television news programs and social media between 2013 and 2018. This crisis has been described as a key catalyst of the radicalization of European political discourse. Crucially, it took shape during a period of profound transformation of the media landscape, in which mass media lost significant ground to social media as authoritative sources of truth and norms. The research focuses on the crucial but underexplored link between television and social media discourse, which is at the heart of contemporary European public debate. Using a combination of digital methods and NLP techniques, the article compares automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts of Dutch televised news on the refugee crisis with responses from publics on Facebook and Twitter. This computational cross-media approach enables a longitudinal analysis of how social media users differ in their interpretation of key events characterizing the crisis, as well as what language is acceptable to debate issues around integration, tolerance and identity. A rejection of mainstream news media editorial guidelines by social media users eventually resulted in their consumption of populist right-wing (‘alternative’) news media and active transgression of anti-discriminatory speech norms.

N2 - Utilizing a nationally representative sample of middle school students, this article focuses on whether students who report experiencing more inquiry-based instruction in science and mathematics classrooms have more positive attitudes toward these subjects. Results of multilevel, multivariate regression analyses revealed that, net of the inclusion of control variables for student, teacher, and school characteristics, a higher frequency of inquiry-based instruction is significantly associated with greater interest, perceptions of utility, and self-efficacy for science and mathematics. Furthermore, although there is some evidence indicating that compared with female students, male students’ perceptions of science utility are higher in relation to more inquiry-based instruction, overall, the weight of evidence clearly leans toward the conclusion that the attitudes of students from different gender and racial/ethnic backgrounds are similarly associated with greater exposure to inquiry-based instruction in both their science and mathematics classrooms.

N2 - Background Endoscopic medial maxillectomy (EMM) is a workhorse for multiple sinonasal conditions. To reduce its burden on the sinonasal physiology, several modified EMM (M-EMM) have been proposed. Objective: In order to provide a theoretical basis for EMM and its modifications, this study introduces a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model, based on a time-resolved direct numerical simulation, describing EMM and assessing the role of the M-EMM in preserving the overall fluid dynamics of the sinonasal cavities. Methods A normal sinonasal CT scan was converted into a geometrical model and used as a reference; 2 anatomies were then created by virtual surgery, mimicking EMM and M-EMM, with the latter sparing the anterior portion of inferior turbinate and medial maxillary sinus wall. The airflow was simulated in the models via the OpenFOAM CFD software and compared in terms of flow rate, mean and fluctuating velocity, vorticity, and turbulent structures. Results The analysis shows that EMM induces a massive flow rate increase in the operated side, which becomes less obvious in the M-EMM model. In contrast to M-EMM, EMM induces higher velocity fields that reach the maxillary sinus. Velocity and vorticity fluctuations are negligible in the baseline model, but become increasingly evident and widespread in the M-EMM and EMM models. Conclusions A significant disruption of the nasal fluid dynamics is observed in EMM, while M-EMM minimizes variations and reduces interference with nasal air conditioning. Our analysis provides insights into the pathophysiology of radical sinus surgery and provides a theoretical basis for the ability of M-EMM to reduce the temporary surgery-related changes on both healthy and operated sides.

N2 - Introduction As an alternative to DNA microarrays, mass spectrometry based analysis of proteomic patterns has shown great potential in cancer diagnosis. The ultimate application of this technique in clinical settings relies on the advancement of the technology itself and the maturity of the computational tools used to analyze the data. A number of computational algorithms constructed on different principles are available for the classification of disease status based on proteomic patterns. Nevertheless, few studies have addressed the difference in the performance of these approaches. In this report, we describe a comparative case study on the classification accuracy of hepatocellular carcinoma based on the serum proteomic pattern generated from a Surface Enhanced Laser Desorption/Ionization (SELDI) mass spectrometer. Methods Nine supervised classification algorithms are implemented in R software and compared for the classification accuracy. Results We found that the support vector machine with radial function is preferable as a tool for classification of hepatocellular carcinoma using features in SELDI mass spectra. Among the rest of the methods, random forest and prediction analysis of microarrays have better performance. A permutation-based technique reveals that the support vector machine with a radial function seems intrinsically superior in learning from the training data since it has a lower prediction error than others when there is essentially no differential signal. On the other hand, the performance of the random forest and prediction analysis of microarrays rely on their capability of capturing the signals with substantial differentiation between groups. Conclusions Our finding is similar to a previous study, where classification methods based on the Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry are compared for the prediction accuracy of ovarian cancer. The support vector machine, random forest and prediction analysis of microarrays provide better prediction accuracy for hepatocellular carcinoma using SELDI proteomic data than six other approaches.
