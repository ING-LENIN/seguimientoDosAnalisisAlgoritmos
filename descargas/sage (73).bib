N2 - In the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) industry, waste is oft framed as an economic problem typically addressed in a building’s construction and demolition phase. Yet, architectural design decision-making can significantly determine construction waste outcomes. Following the logic of zero waste, this research addresses waste minimisation ‘at the source’. By resituating the problem of construction waste within the architectural design process, the research explores waste as a data and informational problem in a design system. Accordingly, this article outlines the creation of an integrated computational design decision support waste tool that employs a novel data structure combining HTML-scraped material data and historic building information modelling (BIM) data to generate waste evaluations in a browser-based 3D modelling platform. Designing an accessible construction waste tool for use by architects and designers aims to heighten awareness of the waste implications of design decisions towards challenging the systems of consumption and production that generate construction and demolition waste.

N2 - Despite the evolution of ventricular assist devices, ventricular assist device patients still suffer from complications due to the damage to blood by fluid dynamic stress. Since rotary ventricular assist devices are assumed to exert mainly shear stress, studies of blood damage are based on shear flow experiments. However, measurements and simulations of cell and protein deformation show normal and shear stresses deform, and potentially damage, cells and proteins differently. The aim was to use computational fluid dynamics to assess the prevalence of normal stress, in comparison with shear stress, in rotary ventricular assist devices. Our calculations showed normal stresses do occur in rotary ventricular assist devices: the fluid volumes experiencing normal stress above 10 Pa were 0.011 mL (0.092%) and 0.027 mL (0.39%) for the HeartWare HVAD and HeartMate II (HMII), and normal stresses over 100 Pa were present. However, the shear stress volumes were up to two orders of magnitude larger than the normal stress volumes. Considering thresholds for red blood cell and von Willebrand factor deformation by normal and shear stresses, the fluid volumes causing deformation by normal stress were between 2.5 and 5 times the size of those causing deformation by shear stress. The exposure times to the individual normal stress deformation regions were around 1 ms. The results clearly show, for the first time, that while blood within rotary ventricular assist devices experiences more shear stress at much higher magnitudes as compared with normal stress, there is sufficient normal stress exposure present to cause deformation of, and potentially damage to, the blood components. This study is the first to quantify the fluid stress components in real blood contacting devices.

N2 - A computational investigation of New MEXICO test cases operating under axial flow conditions is reported. Three wind speed cases (10, 15, 24 m/s) corresponding to three different tip speed ratios (10, 6.67, 4.17) when the turbine operates at 425.1 rpm were considered. ANSYS CFX 2021R1 was employed to perform simulations using Single Reference Frame (SRF) and Multiple Reference Frame (MRF) approaches. The flow field is computed by solving unsteady Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (uRANS) equations coupled with SST k-ω turbulence model and Gamma-Theta transition model. Validation involved comparing CFD-predicted integral quantities, static pressure distributions, and loads with corresponding experimental values demonstrating reasonably good agreement at all three wind speeds. Overall, SRF exhibited slightly better wake predictions (hypothetical), while MRF predictions were closer to measurements for integral quantities, static pressure and loads. This study demonstrates the utility of uRANS-based 3D CFD computations in wind turbine aerodynamics studies.

N2 - A computational fluid dynamics model of a bicuspid aortic valve has been developed using idealised three-dimensional geometry. The aim was to compare how the orifice area and leaflet orientation affect the hemodynamics of a pure bicuspid valve. By applying physiologic material properties and boundary conditions, blood flow shear stresses were predicted during peak systole. A reduced orifice area altered blood velocity, the pressure drop across the valve and the wall shear stress through the valve. Bicuspid models predicted impaired blood flow similar to a stenotic valve, but the flow patterns were specific to leaflet orientation. Flow patterns developed in bicuspid aortic valves, such as helical flow, were sensitive to cusp orientation. In conclusion, the reduced opening area of a bicuspid aortic valve amplifies any impaired hemodynamics, but cusp orientation determines subsequent flow patterns which may determine the specific regions downstream from the valve most at risk of clinical complications.

N2 - A new generation of science curriculum materials is being developed and made widely available across K–12. These materials, along with their associated professional learning, are expected to play a pivotal role in transforming science instruction to meet the vision of A Framework for K–12 Science Education and the performance expectations of the Next Generation Science Standards. This study investigated one of the first widely available middle school curriculum programs designed for the NGSS, Amplify Science 6–8. The study team conducted a randomized experiment to examine the implementation and efficacy of the middle school curriculum program (materials plus teacher professional learning) for improving seventh grade students’ learning in physical science. Findings show that students in schools where the program was implemented significantly outperformed peers in the comparison condition on an NGSS-focused physical science assessment. These findings underscore the importance of conducting additional research on NGSS-designed curriculum programs across other grade levels and within different science domains.

N2 - Objectives To determine the site and nature of altered hemodynamics in pathological internal jugular veins. Method With the use of computational fluid mechanics software we simulated blood flow in 3 D models of the internal jugular veins that exhibited different morphologies, including nozzle-like strictures in their upper parts and valves in the lower parts. Results In a majority of models with nozzle-like strictures, especially those positioned asymmetrically, abnormal flow pattern was revealed, with significant flow separation and regions with reversed flow. Abnormal valves had no significant impact on flow in a case of already altered flow evoked by stricture in upper part of the vein. Conclusions In our jugular model, cranially-located stenoses, which in clinical practice are primarily caused by external compression, cause more significant outflow impact respect to endoluminal defects and pathological valves located more caudally.

N2 - Computational fluid dynamics for ship hydrodynamics has made monumental progress over the last ten years, which is reaching the milestone of providing first-generation simulation-based design tools with vast capabilities for model- and full-scale simulations and optimization. This is due to the enabling technologies such as free surface tracking/capturing, turbulence modeling, 6DoF motion prediction, dynamic overset grids, local/adaptive grid refinement, high performance computing, environmental modeling and optimization methods. Herein, various modeling, numerical methods, and high performance computing approaches for computational ship hydrodynamics are evaluated thereby providing a vision for the development of the next-generation high-fidelity simulation tools. Verification and validation procedures and their applications, including resistance and propulsion, seakeeping, maneuvering, and stability and capsize, are reviewed. Issues, opportunities, and challenges for advancements in higher-fidelity two-phase flow are addressed. Fundamental studies for two-phase flows are also discussed. Conclusions and future directions are also provided.

N2 - Precision of materialized designs is the conventional goal of digital fabrication in architecture. Recently, however, an alternative concept has emerged which refashions the imprecisions of digital processes into creative opportunities. While the computational design community has embraced this idea, its novelty results in a yet incomplete understanding. Prompted by the challenge of the still missing knowledge, this study explored imprecision in four digital fabrication approaches to establish how it influences the aesthetic attributes of materialized designs. Imprecision occurrences for four different digitally aided materialization processes were characterized. The aesthetic features emerging from these imprecisions were also identified and the possibilities of tampering with them for design exploration purposes were discussed. By considering the aesthetic potentials of deliberate imprecision, the study has sought to challenge the canon of high fidelity in contemporary computational design and to argue for imprecision in computation that shapes a new generation of designs featuring the new aesthetic of computational imperfection.

N2 - The aim of this study is to investigate the use of computational fluid dynamics in predicting the performance and geometry of the optimal design of a steam ejector used in a steam turbine. Many scholars have analysed the steam ejector using the ideal gas model, which lacks accuracy in terms of calculating the flow field of the ejector. This study is reported in a series of two papers. The first part covers the validation of CFX 11.0 results using different equations of state (EOS) on the converging–diverging nozzle flow field carried out with the experimental value. The IAPWS IF97 real gas model works well with the experimental value. The flow field of the ejector was analysed using different EOS after grid-dependent learning. The results show that the performance of the ejector was underestimated under the ideal gas model; the entrainment ratio was 20–40 per cent lower than when using the real gas model. The effect of the optimal geometrical design and operating conditions will be discussed in Part 2.
