abstract = {In this work, experimental and theoretical analyses of the power losses in an industrial planetary speed reducer were performed in order to define the weight of the different types of power losses in the global efficiency as well as to understand the appropriateness and the effectiveness of the models and tools available in the literature for the prediction of these power losses. From this investigation, it has emerged that even if for all the kinds of power losses improvements are in principle possible, those for which, at the same time, more improvements seem possible and effective models are lacking are the load-independent power losses. For this reason, a computational fluid dynamics methodology able to evaluate load-independent gear power losses in planetary gearboxes is proposed. The other types of power losses were determined by means of analytical models available in the literature and, together with the calculated load-independent gear power losses, compared with the experimentally determined power losses showing the effectiveness of the adopted calculation models.}

abstract = {Introduction A radiocephalic arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the best choice for achieving vascular access (VA) for hemodialysis, but this AVF has high rates of early failure due to juxta-anastomotic stenosis, making it impossible to use for dialysis. Low hemodynamic shear stress contributes to the pathophysiology of VA failure due to secondary thrombosis, stenosis, and re-occlusion after percutaneous intervention. Methods We used a computational fluid dynamics (CFDs) approach to evaluate the shear stress distribution and minimize its effects under various conditions including changes in the anastomosis angle. A three-dimensional computational domain was designed for arteriovenous end-to-side anastomosis based on anastomosis angles of 45°, 90° and including 135° angle of an obtuse anastomosis using three-dimensional design software. COMSOL Multiphysics® simulation software was used to identify the hemodynamic factors influencing wall shear stress at the anastomosis site using a low Reynolds number k-ε turbulence model that included non-Newtonian blood flow characteristics, the complete cardiac pulse cycle, and distention of blood vessels. In preliminary clinical study, all 201 patients who received a radiocephalic wrist AVF from January 2009 to February 2014 were divided into classic and obtuse angle groups. Results The CFD results showed that the largest anastomosis angle (135°) resulted in lower shear stress, which would help reduce AVF failures. This obtuse angle was preferred, as it minimized the development of anastomotic stenosis and tended to favor primary and primary-assisted patency in clinical study. Conclusions An obtuse radiocephalic wrist AVF shows more favorable patency compared to a classic radiocephalic AVF. Surgeons establishing a radiocephalic wrist AVF would be better to consider an AVF with an obtuse anastomosis.}

abstract = {A call has been made over the last decade for the expansion of epidemiology coursework into high schools in the United States. Epidemiology instruction has been shown to increase student scientific and health literacy, promote critical thinking skills, enhance students’ perception of public health as both practical and relevant, and empower students as independent, lifelong learners. Epidemiology is also a flexible science with relevance to students from diverse backgrounds, skill levels, and interests. While there has been tremendous growth in undergraduate public health education, we have yet to witness the mainstream adoption of epidemiology into high school coursework. In this article, I propose the formal integration of epidemiology into high school curricula to help students practice science as it relates to public health. I posit that epidemiology is a flexible science discipline with real-world significance to students from diverse backgrounds, skill levels, and interests. Also, teaching epidemiology through guided inquiry and authentic learning strategies can intrinsically motivate and empower students to address health-related problems in their local communities. Moreover, epidemiology instruction at the high school level can meet student learning needs, teacher instructional objectives, administrative mandates, and community interests. In essence, epidemiology instruction at the high school level can hone fundamental skills in preparation for health and science careers and promote important public health awareness and interest among adolescents.}

abstract = {With the release of the Next Generation Science Standards and the adoption of the standards by many states, teachers are encouraged to use the engineering design process (EDP) as an instructional approach to teaching science. However, teachers have limited time to teach science and will often neglect science in favor of mathematics and literacy instruction. To make this feasible for elementary classrooms, teachers should be encouraged to implement integrated units of study utilizing EDP to cohesively bind content areas and to increase active learning, critical thinking, and problem solving among all learners. An additional benefit of using EDP as an instructional strategy is the focus on problem solving and the avoidance of one size fits all learning. Students actively engage in learning content (science, mathematics, literacy, social studies) as they collaboratively work together to solve societal and environmental problems. Knowledge is built as students progress through the challenges and content is provided on a need to know basis, thereby differentiating instruction based on learner needs and challenging gifted learners. In this article, the author provides four sample engineering challenges that can be used to create an integrated unit of study using the EDP as an instructional strategy.}

abstract = {Abstract This paper describes the flow analysis in a centrifugal compressor stage using a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) algorithm. The flow unsteadiness arising from the interaction between the impeller and the diffuser has also been analysed using an algorithm suitable for equal or multiple numbers of rotor and diffuser blades. The multi-block, structured grid CFD code TASCflow which provides an approximate solution to the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations was used as a basis and algorithm development was undertaken to provide the required capability of modelling the unsteady interactions of the impeller and the diffuser. The centrifugal compressor stage under investigation consists of 28 radial blades (of which 14 are splitter blades) in the impeller and 27 vanes in the diffuser. The presented results and analysis are for off-design flow conditions where experimental results were available for comparison. The results obtained for the steady-state model show a reasonable agreement with the measurements. In general the unsteady flow field obtained shows a reasonable agreement with experimental data and exhibits considerable differences when compared with the steady-state results.}

abstract = {Narrative can be conceptualised as a complex system, with pragmatic benefits for our description of interpretative and affective processes involved in reading. In this article, I show how systemic thinking has shaped many literary theories, and I offer some suggestions about the modelling of narrative as a complex system. Considering the relations between text, reader, and reading situation as constitutive of narrative requires a way of looking at stories keeping in mind that the reader’s experiential background, their cognitive-affective states, and the situational context all play a crucial role in the emergence of what we call a narrative. Here I suggest that Transformer-based language models can be considered artificial systems that simulate a (disembodied) reading process and make it possible to model narrative as a complex system, including the encoded experiential background of the (simulated) reader.}

abstract = {Abstract A computational intelligence (CI)-based approach is presented for prognostics of machine conditions using morphological signal processing (MSP). The machine vibration signals are processed using MSP to extract a novel entropy-based health index (HI) characterizing the signal shape-size complexity for system prognostics. The progression of HI is predicted using CI techniques, namely, recursive neural network (RNN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector regression (SVR). Both single- and multi-step ahead predictions were evaluated through benchmark datasets of non-linear, non-stationary, and chaotic time series solutions of Mackey-Glass and Lorenz equations. The prognostic effectiveness of the CI techniques was illustrated using a vibration dataset of a helicopter drive-train system gearbox. For each CI predictor, both training datasets gave almost similar prediction performance. In training, the performance of ANFIS was the best, followed by SVR and RNN. In test, the best performance was obtained with SVR for both single- and multi-step ahead predictions. The results are helpful in understanding the relationship between the system conditions, the corresponding indicating feature, the level of degradation, and their progression.}

abstract = {Since its inception, computational social science (CSS) has been characterized as an interdisciplinary field. Nevertheless, unlike a mature interdisciplinary field that duly integrates knowledge beyond disciplinary boundaries, CSS has arguably been fragmented into multiple lines of inquiry. Although such fragmentation has been a constant concern, limited empirical evidence exists to substantiate any degree of integration in research on CSS. To systematically map the landscape of research on CSS, we examined the dynamic topology of the bibliometric network of CSS during the past 20 years. By comparing the structure of the coupling network and the co-subject network with three prototypical network models that we simulated—the centralized model, the fragmented model, and the cohesive model—our analysis revealed that the citation networks of research on CSS are highly centralized but less fragmented than often assumed. Beyond that, a driving factor shaping the coupling network’s cohesive structure is the citation to high-impact articles. Those and other findings contribute to current understandings of the process of integration in the evolution of disciplines.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Thoracic CO2 insufflation with positive intrathoracic pressure is usually effective during thoracoscopic surgery, however, lung collapse is sometimes insufficient. We hypothesized that inappropriate bronchial collapse might cause this unsuccessful lung collapse. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to construct a computational mechanical model of bronchi for practical simulation to discover the optimal conditions of positive intrathoracic pressure during thoracoscopic surgery. METHODS: Micro-focus high-resolution X-ray computed tomography measurements of lungs from just-slaughtered swine were extracted, and the three-dimensional geometries of the bronchi under pressurized and depressurized conditions were measured accurately. The mechanical properties of the bronchus were also measured. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational structural mechanics (CSM) analyses were conducted. RESULTS: The CSM results indicated that the present structural model could simulate bronchial occlusion. The CFD results showed that airflows from pressed lung alveoli might cause low-internal-pressure regions when suddenly or heterogeneously pushed airflow was injected from a small branching bronchus to a large bronchus. A preliminary computational mechanical model of bronchi was constructed. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated the performance of the mechanical model of bronchi in rough simulations of bronchial occlusions. However, this model should be verified further using human data to facilitate its introduction to clinical use.}
