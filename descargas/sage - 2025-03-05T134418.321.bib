abstract = {With the approval of aducanumab on the “Accelerated Approval Pathway” and the recognition of amyloid load as a surrogate marker, new successful therapeutic approaches will be driven by combination therapy as was the case in oncology after the launch of immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, the sheer number of therapeutic combinations substantially complicates the search for optimal combinations. Data-driven approaches based on large databases or electronic health records can identify optimal combinations and often using artificial intelligence or machine learning to crunch through many possible combinations but are limited to the pharmacology of existing marketed drugs and are highly dependent upon the quality of the training sets. Knowledge-driven in silico modeling approaches use multi-scale biophysically realistic models of neuroanatomy, physiology, and pathology and can be personalized with individual patient comedications, disease state, and genotypes to create ‘virtual twin patients’. Such models simulate effects on action potential dynamics of anatomically informed neuronal circuits driving functional clinical readouts. Informed by data-driven approaches this knowledge-driven modeling could systematically and quantitatively simulate all possible target combinations for a maximal synergistic effect on a clinically relevant functional outcome. This approach seamlessly integrates pharmacokinetic modeling of different therapeutic modalities. A crucial requirement to constrain the parameters is the access to preferably anonymized individual patient data from completed clinical trials with various selective compounds. We believe that the combination of data- and knowledge driven modeling could be a game changer to find a cure for this devastating disease that affects the most complex organ of the universe.}

abstract = {The nonlinear behavior of a high-temperature metal-matrix composite (HT-MMC) was simulated by using the METCAN (Metal Matrix Composite Analyzer) computer code. The simulation started with the fabrication process, proceeded to thermo mechanical cyclic loading, and ended with the application of a monotonic load. Classical laminate theory and composite micromechanics and macromechanics are used in MET CAN, along with a multifactor interaction model for the constituents’ behavior. The simu lation of the stress-strain behavior from the macromechanical and the micromechanical points of view, as well as the initiation and final failure of the constituents and the plies in the composite, was examined in detail. It was shown that, when the fibers and the matrix were perfectly bonded, the fracture started in the matrix and then propagated with increas ing load to the fibers. After the fibers fractured, the composite lost its capacity to carry ad ditional load and fractured.}

abstract = {Abstract A proposed modification of the test section in the Boeing/AFOSR Mach 6 Quiet Tunnel is evaluated using CFD. The new design incorporates a section of increased diameter with the intention of enabling the tunnel to start in the presence of larger blunt models. Cone models with fixed base diameter (and hence fixed blockage ratio) are selected for this study. Cone half-angles from 15° to 75° are examined to ascertain the effect of the strength of the test model shock wave on the tunnel startup. The unsteady, laminar, compressible Navier—Stokes equations are solved. The resulting flowfields are examined to see what affect the shocks and shear layers would have on the quiet test section flow. This study indicates that cone angles ≤20° allow the tunnel to start.}

abstract = {Abstract In this article, aerodynamic optimization of a near-sonic passenger plane was conducted, starting with a conventional tail configuration. The genetic algorithm (GA) combined with the Euler simulations were used to maximize the lift-to-drag ratio (L/ D) at Mach 0.95. First, the wing planform shape, twist, and thickness ratios were optimized. As a result, information about the aerodynamic design parameters was obtained and the optimal individual was designed with high inboard sweep angle, long chord length at the root, and less outboard aerofoil thickness. Then, the point of junction was optimized by applying the optimized wing and fuselage. Through the optimization process, the incidence angles of the wing were reduced, and the shapes of the root leading edge were then sharpened to reduce the interference drag. By its aerodynamic performance, the optimized wing/body configuration showed the aerodynamic feasibility of near-sonic flight.}

abstract = {This study aims at the parametric investigation of the gas injection system settings of a large marine two-stroke dual fuel engine by using a developed and customized CFD method in the ANSYS Fluent software. The investigated engine injection system parameters include the gas injection timing, the gas injection duration, the gas injector lateral angle, and the gas injector holes number. Based on the comparison of the predicted performance parameters for the closed-cycle processes, the results indicate that the gas injector lateral angle is the most significant parameter that affects the engine power as well as the NO and CO2 emissions. For satisfying the contradictory objectives of retaining the engine power and reducing the NO and CO2 emissions, appropriate design settings for the gas injection are recommended for the investigated engine operation in the gas mode at 75% load.}
