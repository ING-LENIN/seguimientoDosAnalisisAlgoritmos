abstract = {Acquisition of knowledge must be interwoven with the process of applying it. However, traditional training methods which provide abstract knowledge have shown ineffective for gaining experience of the work. In order to solve this problem, more and more researchers have included narrative in simulation, which is known as narrative simulation. By providing the narratives, participants recognize the choices, decisions, and experience that lead to the consequences of those decisions. It has been proven that narrative simulation is very useful in facilitating in-depth learning and reflective learning. However, conventional methods of data collection and narrative construction for narrative simulation are labor intensive and time consuming. They make use of previous narratives manually and directly. They are inadequate to cope with the fast moving world where knowledge is changing rapidly. In order to provide a way for facilitating the construction of narrative simulation, a novel computational narrative construction method is proposed. By incorporating technologies of knowledge-based system (KBS), computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence (AI), the proposed method provides an efficient and effective way for collecting narratives and automating the construction of narratives. The method converts the unstructured narratives into a structural representation for abstraction and facilitating computing processing. Moreover, it constructs the narratives that combine multiple narratives into a single narrative by applying a forecasting algorithm. The proposed method was successfully implemented in early intervention in mental health care of a social service company in Hong Kong since the case records in that process have structural similarities to narrative. The accuracies of data conversion and predictive function were measured based on recall and precision and encouraging results were obtained. High recall and precision are achieved in the data conversion function, and high recall for the predictive function when new concepts are excluded. The results show that it is possible for converting multiple narratives into a single narrative automatically. Based on the approach, it helps to stimulate knowledge workers to explore new problem solving methods so as to increase the quality of their solutions.}

The results of our research show that ChatGPT is most commonly used in the domains of higher education, K-12 education, and practical skills training. In social media dialogues, the topics most frequently associated with ChatGPT are productivity, efficiency, and ethics. Early adopters' attitudes towards ChatGPT are multifaceted. On one hand, some users view it as a transformative tool capable of amplifying student self-efficacy and learning motivation. On the other hand, there is a degree of apprehension among concerned users. They worry about a potential overdependence on the AI system, which they fear might encourage superficial learning habits and erode students’ social and critical thinking skills. This dichotomy of opinions underscores the complexity of Human-AI Interaction in educational contexts. Our investigation adds depth to this ongoing discourse, providing crowd-sourced insights for educators and learners who are considering incorporating ChatGPT or similar generative AI tools into their pedagogical strategies.}

Based on the tasks abstracted from natural phenomena, such as brain modelling, self-organization, self-repetition, self evaluation, Darwinian survival, granulation and perception, nature serves as a source of inspiration for the development of computational tools or systems that are used for solving complex problems. Nature inspired main computing paradigms used for such development include artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, rough sets, evolutionary algorithms, fractal geometry, DNA computing, artificial life and granular or perception-based computing. Information granulation in granular computing is an inherent characteristic of human thinking and reasoning process performed in everyday life. The present article provides an overview of the significance of natural computing with respect to the granulation-based information processing models, such as neural networks, fuzzy sets and rough sets, and their hybridization.

We derive from the responses a number of topics and examine how associations differ across distinct opinion segments of people, namely supporters of Green growth, Agrowth and Degrowth. The results indicate that the general public is more critical of the notion of economic growth than academic researchers. Citizens stress problems of corruption, social inequality, unemployment and poverty, with less variation among the three opinion segments compared to scientists. The latter more strongly emphasize the environmental consequences of economic growth. Concerning associations of scientists with the term “green growth”, we find topics questioning its feasibility to be more likely expressed by Degrowth supporters, while topics stressing the possibility of sustainable economic growth by Green growth supporters. We find that topic polarization is stronger for scientists than citizens. Our results provide further validation for opinion clusters identified in previous studies and uncover additional insights about related views on growth and sustainability.}

These optimization problems can be solved by optimization techniques. However, these problems are often highly nonlinear and are subject to multiple nonlinear constraints, which makes them very challenging to solve. The further complication to these challenges is the stringent time requirements and high dimensionality, which means that traditional optimization techniques, such as gradient-based methods cannot deal with such kinds of problems well. Recent trends tend to use bio-inspired optimization techniques as a promising alternative, and it is usually combined with traditional methods, especially in the area of image processing. These bio-inspired computational methods are usually based on swarm intelligence and can be very effective in coping with nonlinearity in real-world problems. This chapter presents an overview of bio-inspired computation and its application in image processing, including some current trends and important issues, such as efficiency and time constraints.}

abstract = {Purpose
Reliability and maintainability are the key system effectiveness measures in process and manufacturing industries, and treatment plants, especially in E-waste management plants. The present work is proposed with a motto to develop a stochastic framework for the e-waste management plant to optimize its availability integrated with reliability, availability, maintainability, and dependability (RAMD) measures and Markovian analysis to estimate the steady-state availability of the E-waste management plant. In the analysis an effort is also made to identify the best performing algorithm for availability optimization of the e-waste plant.
Methodology
A stochastic model for a particular plant is developed and its availability is optimized using various metaheuristic approaches like a genetic algorithm (GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and differential evolutions (DE). The most sensitive component is identified using RAMD methodology while the effect of deviation in various failure and repair rates are observed by the proposed model. The failure and repair rates follow an exponential distribution. All time-dependent random variables are statistically independent.
Originality/Novelties
A novel stochastic model is presented for an e-waste management plant and optimum availability is obtained using metaheuristic approaches. The proposed methodology is not so far discussed in the reliability analysis of process industries.
Findings
The numerical results of the proposed model compared to identify the most efficient algorithm. It is observed that genetic algorithm provides the maximum value (0.92330969) of availability at a population size 2500 after 500 iterations. PSO algorithm attained the maximum value (0.99996744) of availability just after 50 iterations and 100 population size. So, its rate of convergence is faster than GA. The optimum value of availability is 0.99997 using differential evolution after 500 iterations and population size of more than 1000. These findings are very beneficial for system designers.
Practical Implications
The proposed methodology can be utilized to find the reliability measures of other process industries.}

This was done by enhancing the user interface and experience of the UCL Network Block Approach to achieve a “thinking sketch” in a way that is “quick” and “fluid” enough to promote inventive and creative sketching comparable to hand sketching. The UCL Network Block Approach draws on the UCL Design Building Block (DBB) approach and uses network methods applied to the synthesis of distributed ship service systems (DS3) and Computer Aided Ship Design (CASD) to expand DS3 definition in early stage ship design. The UCL originated inside-out/DBB approach to sketch driven synthesis has been made translatable to both DBB ship descriptions and ensuring early stage naval architectural “balance”. The proposed approach has been used for the first time successfully to not only carry out a rapid sketching exercise for a naval ship design but also enable quick preliminary analysis of a set of DS3 networks.}

In a spatial agent-based model the agents are situated in a spatial environment and are typically assumed to be able to move in various ways across this environment. Some kinds of social or organizational systems may also be modeled as spatial environments, where agents move from one group or department to another and where communications or mobility among groups may be structured according to implicit or explicit channels or transactions costs. This chapter focuses on the potential usefulness of computational laboratories for spatial agent-based modeling. Speaking broadly, a computational laboratory is any computational framework permitting the exploration of the behaviors of complex systems through systematic and replicable simulation experiments. By that definition, most of the research discussed in this handbook would be considered to be work with computational laboratories. A narrower definition of computational laboratory (or comp lab for short) refers specifically to specialized software tools to support the full range of agent-based modeling and complementary tasks. These tasks include model development, model evaluation through controlled experimentation, and both the descriptive and normative analysis of model outcomes. The objective of this chapter is to explore how comp lab tools and activities facilitate the systematic exploration of spatial agent-based models embodying complex social processes critical for social welfare. Examples include the spatial and temporal coordination of human activities, the diffusion of new ideas or of infectious diseases, and the emergence and ecological dynamics of innovative ideas or of deadly new diseases.}

Guided by an educational model focused on enhancing youths’ present and future interests in and visions of STEM and computing fields, camp activities were collaboratively designed by a community partnership comprised of a local camp provider, the local school district, and researchers. Situating design in a community partnership helped highlight and integrate locally relevant resources, careers, and community opportunities.

In order to explain why some answers might be preferred over others, frequencies of appearance of the queries and solutions are analyzed. The difficulty encountered by humans when solving RAT queries is expressed in response times and percentage of participants solving the query, and a significant moderate correlation between human data on query difficulty and the data provided by this approach is obtained.}

abstract = {The great improvement of algorithms and computing hardware in the last few years must be ranked as one of the most important turning points in the history of multiphase flow research. After a brief review of some of this recent progress, it is pointed out that, besides its application to solving actual problems, computational physics plays other key roles: (1) As a tool to develop and understand basic physics and as a guide toward asking more penetrating questions; (2) As an aid in closing the averaged equations; (3) As a means to learn to compute better. Roadblocks toward greater effectiveness are the huge complexity of many of the necessary computational tasks but also, at a more practical level, the transmission of “computational knowledge” from one researcher to another, much in the same way as experimentalists can rely on readily available equipment (e.g., lasers, etc.), without having to build each item themselves. The solution to this problem will require a cultural shift––from a “cottage industry” to a “big science” mentality––which can be aided by a different attitude on the part of the funding agencies. Great synergism can be achieved by a closer integration of the multiphase computational physics enterprise with both Applied Mathematics and Computer Science.}

abstract = {We develop a formal model for distributed measurement-based quantum computations, adopting an agent-based view, such that computations are described locally where possible. Because the network quantum state is in general entangled, we need to model it as a global structure, reminiscent of global memory in classical agent systems. Local quantum computations are described as measurement patterns. Since measurement-based quantum computation is inherently distributed, this allows us to extend naturally several concepts of the measurement calculus [V. Danos, E. Kashefi and P. Panangaden, The measurement calculus (2004), arXiv:quant-ph/0412135], a formal model for such computations. Our goal is to define an assembly language, i.e. we assume that computations are well-defined and we do not concern ourselves with verification techniques. The operational semantics for systems of agents is given by a probabilistic transition system, and we define operational equivalence in a way that it corresponds to the notion of bisimilarity. With this in place, we prove that teleportation is bisimilar to a direct quantum channel, and this also within the context of larger networks.}

abstract = {Euler diagrams are an accessible and effective visualisation of data involving simple set-theoretic relationships. Sets are represented by closed curves in the plane and often have wellformedness conditions placed on them in order to enhance comprehensibility. The theoretical underpinning for tool support has usually focussed on the problem of generating an Euler diagram from an abstract model. However, the problem of efficient computation of the abstract model from the concrete diagram has not been addressed before, despite this computation being a necessity for computer interpretations of user drawn diagrams. This may be used, together with automated manipulations of the abstract model, for purposes such as semantic information presentation or diagrammatic theorem proving. Furthermore, in interactive settings, the user may update diagrams “on-line” by adding and removing curves, for example, in which case a system requirement is the update of the abstract model (without the necessity of recomputation of the entire abstract model). We define the notion of marked Euler diagrams, together with a method for associating marked points on the diagram with regions in the plane. Utilising these, we provide on-line algorithms which quickly compute the abstract model of a weakly reducible wellformed Euler diagram (constructible as a sequence of additions or removals of curves, keeping a wellformed diagram at each step), and quickly updates both the set of curves in the plane as well as the abstract model according to the on-line operations. Efficiency is demonstrated by comparison with a common, naive algorithm. Furthermore, the methodology enables a straightforward implementation which has subsequently been realised as an application for the user classification domain.}

For these soldiers, the health parameters of every individual need to be monitored on a real-time basis and subsequent analysis of the dataset to be made for initiating appropriate medical support with the lowest possible delay. In this paper, a three-layer service-oriented IoT architecture has been proposed where the computational functionalities are distributed among all the layers. The proposed distributed computing mechanism has implemented two levels of filtration of redundant information that belongs to safe soldiers. The first level of filtering is done at the end-node using the Fuzzy classification approach and the second level of filtering is done at the intermediate node using the time-series pattern analysis approach. This layer-wise filtration process results in a reduction in data flooding and computational burden on the cloud due to which system response time improves to suit emergency applications. A prototype has been developed to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.}

The beta and gamma neural oscillations of healthy participants were recorded via a 32 channel wireless 10/20 international EGG system. In real and augmented environments and for both the mental imagery and execution tasks, the participants displayed a similar cortico-cortical neural signature essentially based on synchronous vs asynchronous beta and gamma oscillatory activities between anterior (i.e. frontal) and posterior (i.e. parietal, occipito-parietal and occipito-temporal) areas bilaterally.

This study aims to look at the design and implementation of a CS learning ecosystem that supports girls of color in acquiring critical CS skills starting in middle school.
Design/methodology/approach
This mixed-method case study included 53 girls, between the ages of 11 and 13, in four US middle schools. Study methods included the analysis of a pre-program student survey, longitudinal interviews and focus groups, weekly observations and computing artifacts.
Findings
Program participants were interested in CS, were confident in their ability to learn CS, had prior coding and CS experience and had parents and teachers who encouraged them to learn CS. But some students showed dependent learning behaviors while engaging in CS activities. These included relying on instructors and being reticent to make mistakes–behaviors that limit learning. The CS learning ecosystem supported students as they shifted from applying dependent learning approaches to applying independent learning approaches. Instructors sustained a growth mindset and supported productive struggle as students learned CS skills.
Originality/value
A CS learning system supported equitable learning experiences and helped students develop independent learning behaviors that led to deeper engagement in CS.}

Initially trained as a theoretical mathematician and having collaborated with non-mathematicians in the field of bone research, I address the advantages and challenges of collaborations across fields of research among investigators trained in different disciplines. I report on the mathematical ideas that have guided my research on the mechanics of bone tissue. I explain how the mathematical ideas of local vs. global properties influence my research. Polarized light microscopy (PLM) is a tool that I use consistently, in association with other microscopy techniques, to investigate bone in its healthy state and in the presence of bone disease, in humans and in animal models. I review the results that I and investigators around the world have obtained with PLM. Applied to thin bone sections, PLM yields extinct (black) and bright (white) signals that are interpreted in terms of the orientation of collagen type I, by means of other microscopy techniques. Collagen type I is an elementary component of bone tissue. Its orientation is important for the mechanical function of bone. Images obtained by PLM at a specific bone site yield big data sets regarding collagen orientation. Multiple data sets in respect of multiple sites are often needed for research because the bone tissue differs by location in response to the distinct forces acting on it. Mathematics, defined by philosophers as the theory of patterns, offers the backdrop for pattern identification in the big data sets regarding collagen orientation. I also discuss the computational aspect of the research, pursuant to which the patterns identified are incorporated in simulations of mechanical behaviors of bone. These mathematical ideas serve to understand the role of collagen orientation in bone fracture risk.}

abstract = {The critical importance of sample context and geologic information for interpreting geochronologic data has long been fundamental to the Earth sciences. However, the lack of quantitative uncertainties associated with contextual, observational information means that much geologic data cannot be statistically treated in computational models using the same approaches as quantitative datasets. This challenge is showcased by the current debate over whether and how geologic data should be used when modeling thermochronologic results, which has important implications for deriving time-temperature (tT) paths from which burial and exhumation histories are interpreted. Holistically leveraging observational data to test hypotheses and determine the set of geologically reasonable thermal histories that can explain thermochronologic results has a longstanding history, but some recent studies have criticized this approach as one that arbitrarily limits tT solutions. Here, a geologic context approach to thermal history modeling, in which observational and thermochronologic datasets are combined to design geologically valid models and reach the most geologically likely interpretation, is illustrated using an example of constraining Great Unconformity exhumation in Colorado where this modeling philosophy has been questioned. Although the quality of geologic data and their applicability to modeled samples can vary and be debated, this does not mean that all geologic data are inherently unreliable and therefore discardable. Exploring models with varying or minimal constraints can be useful to test different hypotheses and determine the resolving power of the data, but using an endmember context-blind approach to interpret thermochronologic results can produce outcomes that violate fundamental aspects of the geology. The strategy outlined here is not the only valid approach to modeling thermochronologic data, but if the purpose of the modeling is to derive meaningful interpretations about sample tT paths in order to better illuminate the geologic history, then critical thinking about the sample context, first order geologic observations, and primary relationships should be integral components of the modeling process.}

We review developmental, behavioral, and computational evidence that seems to favor an alternative view of language, according to which linguistic structures are generated by a large, open set of constructions of varying degrees of abstraction and complexity, which embody both form and meaning and are acquired through socially situated experience in a given language community, by probabilistic learning algorithms that resemble those at work in other cognitive modalities.}

Aiming at the development of a new antichagasic pharmacological tool, the density functional theory was used to calculate the reactivity descriptors of amentoflavone, a biflavonoid with proven anti-trypanosomal activity in vitro, as well as to perform a study of interactions with the enzyme cruzain, an enzyme key in the evolutionary process of T-cruzi. Structural properties (in solvents with different values of dielectric constant), the infrared spectrum, the frontier orbitals, Fukui analysis, thermodynamic properties were the parameters calculated from DFT method with the monomeric structure of the apigenin used for comparison. Furthermore, molecular docking studies were performed to assess the potential use of this biflavonoid as a pharmacological antichagasic tool. The frontier orbitals (HOMO-LUMO) study to find the band gap of compound has been extended to calculate electron affinity, ionization energy, electronegativity electrophilicity index, chemical potential, global chemical hardness and global chemical softness to study the chemical behaviour of compound. The optimized structure was subjected to molecular Docking to characterize the interaction between amentoflavone and cruzain enzyme, a classic pharmacological target for substances with anti-gas activity, where significant interactions were observed with amino acid residues from each one's catalytic sites enzyme. These results suggest that amentoflavone has the potential to interfere with the enzymatic activity of cruzain, thus being an indicative of being a promising antichagasic agent.}

Despite proving valuable as computational-level methods to account for people’s behaviour, their descriptive and explanatory powers remain largely unexplored. In a series of experiments, we used a naturalistic crime investigation scenario to examine how people evaluate queries, as well as outcomes, in probabilistic contexts. We aimed to uncover the psychological strategies that people use, not just to assess whether they deviated from OED principles. In addition, we explored the adaptiveness of the identified strategies across both one-shot and stepwise information search tasks. We found that people do not always evaluate queries strictly in OED terms and use distinct strategies, such as by identifying a leading contender at the outset. Moreover, we identified aspects of zero-sum thinking and risk aversion that interact with people’s information search strategies. Our findings have implications for building a descriptive account of information seeking and evaluation, accounting for factors that currently lie outside the realm of information-theoretic OED measures, such as context and the learner’s own preferences.}

Structural attitudes toward uncertainty are assessed in design thinking literature before other possible ways of viewing uncertainty in the design process are introduced. Uncertainty is then presented as a source of epistemological difference between design disciplines, and this difference is explicated through a project that uses literature survey and analytical diagramming to map differences between discipline attitudes to uncertainty. Our review identifies uncertainty as a prevalent source of discipline difference with the goal of better describing barriers, and effective responses to them, in inter- and trans-disciplinary design agendas.}

Deep learning involves huge amounts of matrix multiplications and other operations which can be massively parallelized and thus sped up on GPUs. A single GPU might have thousands of cores while a CPU usually has no more than 12 cores. GPU's practical applicability is affected by two issues: long training time and limited GPU memory, which is greatly influenced as the neural network size grows. In order to overcome these issues, this chapter presents various technologies in distributed parallel processing which improve the training time and optimize the memory, and hardware engine architectures will be explored for data size reduction. The GPUs generally used for deep learning are limited in memory size compared to CPUs, so even the latest Tesla GPU has only 16 GB of memory. Therefore, GPU memory cannot be increased to that extent easily, so networks must be designed to fit within the available memory. This could be a factor limiting progress, overcoming which would be highly beneficiary to the computational intelligence area.}

In addition, novel technological tools and programming environments have offered new opportunities and increased the need to design effective learning experiences. This paper presents a design-based research (DBR) approach conducted over two years, based on constructionism-based coding experiences for children, following the four stages of DBR. Three iterations (cycles) were designed and examined in total, with participants aged 8–17 years old, using mixed methods. Over the two years, we conducted workshops in which students used a block-based programming environment (i.e., Scratch) and collaboratively created a socially meaningful artifact (i.e., a game). The study identifies nine design principles that can help us to achieve higher engagement during the coding activity. Moreover, positive attitudes and high motivation were found to result in the better management of cognitive load. Our contribution lies in the theoretical grounding of the results in constructionism and the emerging design principles. In this way, we provide both theoretical and practical evidence of the value of constructionism-based coding activities.}

Whereas I do agree with the authors on most points, I am less convinced that “existing management theory” will suffice to address the problem of “reset thinking”. In this article, I demonstrate that the economy-bias of existing theories is a gateway for “reset thinking” geared towards an allegedly necessary re-/socialisation of management and organisation. A research agenda on cronyism must therefore be complemented by one on privilege and hierarchy not only as undesirable side-effects of cronyism, but also as desired outcomes of advocacy for specific minorities or missions. As self-identifications with group interests or calls for missions have become popular in management theory, I conclude that this new appetite for privilege might undermine not only the higher ideals of many management theorists, but also the foundations of modern society.}

This paper provides a generalization for each method in a unified manner so that they can be used for some difficult maximum likelihood computation, when, for example, there exist constraints on the parameters. A generalized method does not use directly the Newton-type iteration formulas of these methods, but, instead, uses the corresponding quadratic functions transformed from them. It proceeds by repeatedly approximating the log-likelihood function with the quadratic functions in the neighborhoods of the current iterates and optimizing each quadratic function within the parameter space. It is shown that each quadratic function has a weighted linear regression formulation, which can be conveniently solved. This generalization also extends the applicability of the Fisher scoring method to situations when the expected Fisher information matrices are unavailable in closed form. Fast computation can generally be anticipated, owing to their small rates of convergence and a rapid solution of each linear regression problem. While the generalized Gauss–Newton method may sometimes suffer for the so-called large residual problem, the generalized Fisher scoring method has performed consistently well in the numerical experiments we conducted.}

Parallel computation represents not only a new mode of computation, but, a new intellectual paradigm. This chapter provides an overview of the technology of parallel computation in terms of hardware and programming languages; presents some of the fundamental classes of problems encountered in economics and the associated numerical methodologies for their solution; discusses the state-of-the-art computational techniques and focuses on parallel techniques and contrasts them with serial techniques for illumination and instructive purposes; and presents applications of the classes of problems and associated numerical methods to econometrics, microeconomics, macroeconomics, and finance. The emergence of computation as a basic scientific methodology in economics has given access to solutions of fundamental problems that pure analysis, observation, or experimentation could not have achieved. Parallel computation represents the wave of the future. It is considered to be cheaper and faster than serial computing and the only approach to faster computation currently foreseeable. Parallel computation is appealing, hence, for the economies of scale that are possible, for the potentially faster solution of large-scale problems, and also for the possibilities that it presents for imitating adjustment or tatonnement processes.}

In this paper, the design of a PID controller, based on the universal model of the plant, is derived, in which there is only one parameter to be tuned. This is an attractive feature from the viewpoint of plant operators. Fuzzy and neural approaches – bio-inspired methods in the field of computational intelligence – are used to design and assess the efficiency of the PID controller design based on differential evolution optimization in nonlinear plants. The numerical results presented herein indicate that the proposed bio-inspired design is effective for the nonlinear control of nonlinear plants.}

The teaching framework also has a strong emphasis on the development of professional skills and to evaluate the recommended design solutions considering multiple perspectives such as economics, safety, environment and societal context. The framework is implemented through week-long group projects called Scenarios, taking place mainly in the first two years of study, and examples are given of different variations of Scenarios. This teaching approach has multiple benefits, including but not limited to, students’ understanding of PSE tools and the development of their critical engineering thinking.}

ABSTRACT
Undergraduate genetics courses have historically focused on simple genetic models, rather than taking a more multifactorial approach where students explore how traits are influenced by a combination of genes, the environment, and gene-by-environment interactions. While a focus on simple genetic models can provide straightforward examples to promote student learning, they do not match the current scientific understanding and can result in deterministic thinking among students. In addition, undergraduates are often interested in complex human traits that are influenced by the environment, and national curriculum standards include learning objectives that focus on multifactorial concepts. This research aims to discover to what extent multifactorial genetics is currently being assessed in undergraduate genetics courses. To address this, we analyzed over 1,000 assessment questions from a commonly used undergraduate genetics textbook; published concept assessments; and open-source, peer-reviewed curriculum materials. Our findings show that current genetics assessment questions overwhelmingly emphasize the impact of genes on phenotypes and that the effect of the environment is rarely addressed. These results indicate a need for the inclusion of more multifactorial genetics concepts, and we suggest ways to introduce them into undergraduate courses.}

Thereafter, the attention is directed to answering the question set out; (ii) Secondly, it digs into the understanding of life toward deeper levels of reality; (iii) It is shown that non-trivial quantum effects shed insightful lights on the information processing of and within living beings; (iv) Once the distinction is made between increasing levels of complexity and increasing levels of organization, the focus lies in the importance of QB for organization, and not so much for complexity as such; (v) The role of information rises at the center of all concerns, and the intertwining of complexity and information processing.

This study examined the prevalence and course of abstract and concrete responses to semantic proverbs and aberrant abstraction (composite score of semantic, visual-spatial, and social comprehension) over 20 years in 352 participants diagnosed with schizophrenia, affective psychosis, and unipolar non-psychotic depression. We utilized linear models, two-way ANOVA and contrasts to compare groups and change over time. Linear models with Generalized Estimation Equation (GEE) to determine association. Our findings show that regardless of diagnosis, semantic proverb interpretation improves over time. Participants with schizophrenia give more concrete responses to proverbs when compared to affective psychosis and unipolar depressed without psychosis. We also show that the underlying structure of concretism encompasses increased conceptual overinclusion at index hospitalization and idiosyncratic associations at follow-up; whereas, abstract thinking overtime encompasses increased visual-spatial abstraction at index and rich associations with increased social comprehension scores at follow-up. Regardless of diagnosis, premorbid functioning, descriptive characteristics, and IQ were not associated with aberrant abstraction. Delusions are highly and positively related to aberrant abstraction scores, while hallucinations are mildly and positively related to this score. Lastly, our data point to the importance of examining the underlying interconnected structures of ‘established’ constructs vis-à-vis mixed methods to provide a description of the rich interior world that may not always map onto current quantitative measures.}

The method is based on the expansion of the flow variables on a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) basis, calculated from a limited number of snapshots, which are obtained via Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Then, the POD-mode amplitudes are calculated as minimizers of a properly defined overall residual of the equations and boundary conditions. The residual can be calculated using only a limited number of points in the flow field, which can be scattered either all over the whole computational domain or over a smaller projection window. This means that the process is both computationally efficient (reconstructed flow fields require less than 1% of the time needed to compute a full CFD solution) and flexible (the projection window can avoid regions of large localized CFD errors). Also, various definitions of the residual are briefly discussed, along with the number and distribution of snapshots, the number of retained modes, and the effect of CFD errors, to conclude that the method is numerically robust. This is because the results are largely insensitive to the definition of the residual, to CFD errors, and to the CFD method itself, which may contain artificial stabilizing terms. Thus, the method is amenable for practical engineering applications.}

We recruited 53 volunteers for a simulated telehealth psychiatric intake interview. The sample included 14 individuals with current MDD, 21 with past MDD, and 18controls, all confirmed using a semi-structured diagnostic interview. The manually-transcribed interview transcripts were analyzed utilizing the LIWC-22 dictionary and statistical tests were applied to identify differences in the linguistic patterns between each clinical categorization. When comparing depressed subjects (either current or past) versus controls, significant differences were found for emotional tone, total function words, auxiliary verbs, negative tone, negative emotion, anxiety, sadness, attention, and visual. Individuals with past MDD only differed from those with current MDD in use of analytical thinking and auxiliary verbs. These results indicate that LIWC categories could differentiate current or past depressed subjects from controls, but fewer differences emerged when comparing current and past MDD. Further prospective studies with larger sample sizes are needed to confirm these findings.}

Others point out the biases and cognitive distortions inherent in disregarding information. Researchers have used both simulations and experiments to study how the use of heuristics affects the decision's outcome. However, a good decision is determined by the process and not a lucky outcome. It is a conscious reflection on the decision-maker's information and preferences. Therefore, a heuristic must be assessed by its ability to match a structured decision processing all available information. Thus, the question remains: how often does the reduction of information considered in heuristic decisions lead to a different recommended alternative? We applied different heuristics to a dataset of 945 real, personal decisions. We have found that by using heuristics instead of a fully developed decision structure, in 60.34% of cases, a different alternative would have been recommended to the decision-maker leading to a mean relative utility loss for the deviating decisions of 34.58%. This shows that a continuous effort to reflect on the weighing of objectives and alternatives leads to better decisions.}

abstract = {Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is considered among the best seminal meta-heuristic algorithms,boasting merits of minimal parameter requirements, straightforward implementation, and highly accelerated convergence capacity, lower computational complexity, etc. Nevertheless, it also has drawbacks, for instance, it tends to converge prematurely at local optima, lack of diversity, and low accuracy. In order to effectively overcome these shortcomings, this paper presents a multi-strategy fusion enhanced PSO called MSFPSO algorithm. Firstly,It motivated by the black-winged kite algorithm, a migration mechanism based on Cauchy's variation is introduced. This mechanism contributes to the efficiency and effectiveness of the algorithm in exploiting the present search area. Also, it effectively balances the dynamics relationship between exploration and exploitation, boosting the algorithm's global and local search capabilities.Second, a joint-opposition selection strategy is introduced for expanding the solution search range. Our approach is designed to avoid getting stuck in local optima. Specifically, selective opposition obtains the proximity dimension of a candidate solution through a linearly decreasing threshold. Dynamic opposition further extends the process of investigating the solution space. The algorithm is fully incorporated with the differential creative search algorithm for dual-strategy scenarios to enhance the performance of the decision-making effectiveness, population diversity, exploitation capability of the PSO. Finally, an attraction-rejection optimization strategy is introduced to further obtain a good exploitation-exploration balance capability and avoid stagnation of the algorithm. In addition, the comparison results with eight advanced optimization algorithms and six improved particle swarm optimization algorithms on CEC2020 test sets, and the statistical analysis was conducted by Wilcoxon rank sum test. It illustrate the features of the MSFPSO developed within this research strong competitiveness. The convergence of the algorithm was verified at maximum iterations of 10000 on the CEC2017 test set. Meanwhile, the experimental outcomes of applying MSFPSO to 50 practical engineering design challenges prove its effectiveness and strong applicability. The test results and numerical computations manifest that the MSFPSO algorithm with strong competitiveness will become a preferred class of meta-heuristic algorithms to tackle issues within the realm of engineering optimization.}

abstract = {The relationship between nonword repetition ability and vocabulary size and vocabulary learning has been a topic of intense research interest and investigation over the last two decades, following the demonstration that nonword repetition accuracy is predictive of vocabulary size (Gathercole & Baddeley, 1989). However, the nature of this relationship is not well understood. One prominent account posits that phonological short-term memory (PSTM) is a causal determinant both of nonword repetition ability and of phonological vocabulary learning, with the observed correlation between the two reflecting the effect of this underlying third variable (e.g., Baddeley, Gathercole, & Papagno, 1998). An alternative account proposes the opposite causality: that it is phonological vocabulary size that causally determines nonword repetition ability (e.g., Snowling, Chiat, & Hulme, 1991). We present a theory of phonological vocabulary learning, instantiated as a computational model. The model offers a precise account of the construct of PSTM, of performance in the nonword repetition task, of novel word form learning, and of the relationship between all of these. We show through simulation not only that PSTM causally affects both nonword repetition accuracy and phonological vocabulary size, but also that phonological vocabulary size causally affects nonword repetition ability. The plausibility of the model is supported by the fact that its nonword repetition accuracy displays effects of phonotactic probability and of nonword length, which have been taken as evidence for causal effects on nonword repetition accuracy of phonological vocabulary knowledge and PSTM, respectively. Thus the model makes explicit how the causal links posited by the two theoretical perspectives are both valid, in the process reconciling the two perspectives, and indicating that an opposition between them is unnecessary.}

We show that how a researcher elicits such beliefs – in particular, whether the belief is about the participant’s opponent, an unrelated other, or the population of others – strongly affects the belief reports. We study the underlying processes and find a clear consensus effect. Yet, when matching the opponent’s action would lead to a low payoff and the researcher asks for the belief about this opponent, ex-post rationalization kicks in and beliefs are re-adjusted again. Hence, we recommend to ask about unrelated others or about the population in such cases, as ‘opponent beliefs’ are even more detached from the beliefs participants had when deciding about their actions in the corresponding game. We find no evidence of wishful thinking in any of the treatments.}

Computational neuroscience is a relatively young discipline that is growing rapidly. Most of the models that have been developed thus far have been aimed at interpreting experimental data and providing a conceptual framework for the dynamic properties of neural systems.

We present a structured process model for the generation of policy alternatives in settings that include non-quantifiable elements and where portfolio optimisation approaches are not applicable. Behavioural issues and path dependence as well as heuristics and biases which can occur during the process are discussed. The behavioural experiment compares policy alternatives obtained by using two different portfolio generation techniques.

abstract = {The state-of-the-art of membrane technology is characterized by a number of mature applications such as sterile filtration, hemodialysis, water purification and gas separation, as well as many more niche applications of successful membrane-based separation and processing of fluid mixtures. The membrane industry is currently employing a portfolio of established materials, mostly standard polymers or inorganic materials (not originally developed for membranes), and easily scalable manufacturing processes such as phase inversion, interfacial polymerization and coating. Innovations in membranes and their manufacturing processes must meet the desired intrinsic properties that determine selectivity and flux, for specific applications. However, tunable and stable performance, as well as sustainability over the entire life cycle of membrane products are becoming increasingly important. Membrane manufacturers are progressively required to share the carbon footprint of their membrane modules with their customers. Environmental awareness among the world's population is a growing phenomenon and finds its reflection in product development and manufacturing processes. In membrane technology one can see initial steps in this direction with the replacement of hazardous solvents, the utilization of renewable materials for membrane production and the reuse of membrane modules. Other examples include increasing the stability of organic membrane polymers and lowering the cost of inorganic membranes. In a long-term perspective, many more developments in materials science will be required for making new, advanced membranes. These include “tools” such as self-assembly or micro- and nano-fabrication, and “building blocks”, e.g. tailored block copolymers or 1D, 2D and 3D materials. Such membranes must be fabricated in a simpler manner and be more versatile than existing ones. In this perspective paper, a vision of such LEGO®-like membranes with precisely adjustable properties will be illustrated with, where possible, examples that already demonstrate feasibility. These include the possibility to switch properties using an external stimulus, adapting a membrane's selectivity to a given separation, or providing the ability to assemble, disassemble and reassemble the membrane on a suitable support as scaffold, in situ, in place and on-demand. Overall, it is foreseen that the scope of future membrane applications will become much wider, based on improved existing membrane materials and manufacturing processes, as well as the combination of novel, tailor-made “building blocks” and “tools” for the fabrication of next-generation membranes tuned to specific applications.}

abstract = {Objective:
Stimulation of axons within the dorsal columns of the human spinal cord has become a widely used therapy to treat refractory neuropathic pain. The mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated and may even be contrary to standard “gate control theory.” Our hypothesis is that a computational model provides a plausible description of the mechanism by which dorsal column stimulation (DCS) inhibits wide dynamic range (WDR) cell output in a neuropathic model but not in a nociceptive pain model.
Materials and Methods:
We created a computational model of the human spinal cord involving approximately 360,000 individual neurons and dendritic processing of some 60 million synapses—the most elaborate dynamic computational model of the human spinal cord to date. Neuropathic and nociceptive “pain” signals were created by activating topographically isolated regions of excitatory interneurons and high-threshold nociceptive fiber inputs, driving analogous regions of WDR neurons. Dorsal column fiber activity was then added at clinically relevant levels (e.g., Aβ firing rate between 0 and 110 Hz by using a 210-μsec pulse width, 50–150 Hz frequency, at 1–3 V amplitude).
Results:
Analysis of the nociceptive pain, neuropathic pain, and modulated circuits shows that, in contradiction to gate control theory, 1) nociceptive and neuropathic pain signaling must be distinct, and 2) DCS neuromodulation predominantly affects the neuropathic signal only, inhibiting centrally sensitized pathological neuron groups and ultimately the WDR pain transmission cells.
Conclusion:
We offer a different set of necessary premises than gate control theory to explain neuropathic pain inhibition and the relative lack of nociceptive pain inhibition by using retrograde DCS. Hypotheses regarding not only the pain relief mechanisms of DCS were made but also regarding the circuitry of pain itself, both nociceptive and neuropathic. These hypotheses and further use of the model may lead to novel stimulation paradigms.}

The degree of visual imagery present in routine thought and how it is encoded in the brain is largely unknown. We test whether fMRI activity patterns elicited by participants reading objects' names include embodied visual-object representations, and whether we can decode the representations using novel computational image-based semantic models. We first apply the image models in conjunction with text-based semantic models to test predictions of visual-specificity of semantic representations in different brain regions. Representational similarity analysis confirms that fMRI structure within ventral-temporal and lateral-occipital regions correlates most strongly with the image models and conversely text models correlate better with posterior-parietal/lateral-temporal/inferior-frontal regions. We use an unsupervised decoding algorithm that exploits commonalities in representational similarity structure found within both image model and brain data sets to classify embodied visual representations with high accuracy (8/10) and then extend it to exploit model combinations to robustly decode different brain regions in parallel. By capturing latent visual-semantic structure our models provide a route into analyzing neural representations derived from past perceptual experience rather than stimulus-driven brain activity. Our results also verify the benefit of combining multimodal data to model human-like semantic representations.}

Secondly, in the statistical investigation, the experimental data are analyzed by using linear multiple and quadratic multiple-regression models. Later, in the computational intelligence based investigation, the data obtained from the experimental study are analyzed by using artificial neural networks that are universal approximators which provide a massively parallel processing and decentralized computing. Specially, radial basis function neural network structure is chosen. In this structure, cross-validation technique is used in order to determine the number of radial basis functions.

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to investigate the ethical and responsible use of AI chatbots in education in support of critical thinking, cognitive flexibility and self-regulation in terms of their potential to enhance and motivate teaching and learning in contemporary education environments. AI chatbots such as ChatGPT by OpenAI appear to be improving in conversational and other capabilities and this paper explores such advances using version 4. Based on a review of the research literature, a conceptual framework is formulated for responsible use of AI chatbots in education supporting cognitive flexibility in AI-rich learning environments. The framework is then operationalized for use in this paper through the development of exemplars for math, english language arts (ELA), and studying with ChatGPT to close learning gaps in an effort to foster more ethical and responsible approaches to the design and development of AI chatbots for application and use in teaching and learning environments. This paper extends earlier foundational work on cognitive flexibility and AI chatbots as well as work on cognitive flexibility in support of creativity and innovation with AI chatbots in urban civic spaces.}

abstract = {System xc− represents an intriguing target in attempts to understand the pathological states of the central nervous system. Also called a cystine-glutamate antiporter, system xc− typically functions by exchanging one molecule of extracellular cystine for one molecule of intracellular glutamate. Nonvesicular glutamate released during cystine-glutamate exchange activates extrasynaptic glutamate receptors in a manner that shapes synaptic activity and plasticity. These findings contribute to the intriguing possibility that extracellular glutamate is regulated by a complex network of release and reuptake mechanisms, many of which are unique to glutamate and rarely depicted in models of excitatory signaling. Because system xc− is often expressed on non-neuronal cells, the study of cystine-glutamate exchange may advance the emerging viewpoint that glia are active contributors to information processing in the brain. It is noteworthy that system xc− is at the interface between excitatory signaling and oxidative stress, because the uptake of cystine that results from cystine-glutamate exchange is critical in maintaining the levels of glutathione, a critical antioxidant. As a result of these dual functions, system xc− has been implicated in a wide array of central nervous system diseases ranging from addiction to neurodegenerative disorders to schizophrenia. In the current review, we briefly discuss the major cellular components that regulate glutamate homeostasis, including glutamate release by system xc−. This is followed by an in-depth discussion of system xc− as it relates to glutamate release, cystine transport, and glutathione synthesis. Finally, the role of system xc− is surveyed across a number of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.}

One of these areas is programming learning and program writing processes. One of the generative AI tools used for this purpose is ChatGPT. The use of ChatGPT in program writing processes has become widespread, and this tool has a certain potential in the programming process. However, when the literature is examined, research results related to using ChatGPT for this purpose have yet to be found. The existing literature has a gap that requires exploration. This study aims to analyze the students' perspectives on using ChatGPT in the field of programming and programming learning. The study encompassed a cohort of 41 undergraduate students enrolled in a public university's Computer Technology and Information Systems department. The research was carried out within the scope of the Object-Oriented Programming II course for eight weeks. Throughout the research process, students were given project assignments related to the course every week, and they were asked to use ChatGPT while solving them. The research data was collected using a form consisting of open-ended questions and analyzed through content analysis. The research findings revealed both the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT usage, as perceived by the students. The students stated that the main benefits of using ChatGPT in programming learning are providing fast and mostly correct answers to questions, improving thinking skills, facilitating debugging, and increasing self-confidence. On the other hand, the main limitations of using ChatGPT in programming education were getting students used to laziness, being unable to answer some questions, or giving incomplete/incorrect answers, causing professional anxiety in students. Based on the results of the research, it can be said that it would be useful to integrate generative AI tools into programming courses considering the advantages they provide in programming teaching. However, appropriate measures should be taken regarding the limitations it brings. Based on the research findings, several recommendations were proposed regarding the integration of ChatGPT into lessons.}

Contrary to these strategies, recognition primed decision (RPD) model which is a primary naturalistic decision making (NDM) approach assumes that experienced and professional decision makers when encounter problems in real operating conditions are able to use their previous experiences and trainings in order to diagnose the problem, recall the appropriate solution, evaluate it mentally, and implement it to handle the problem in a satisficing manner. In this paper, a computational form of RPD, now called C-RPD, is presented. Unified Modeling Language was used as a modeling language to represent the proposed C-RPD model in order to make the implementation easy and obvious. To execute the model, RoboCup Rescue agent simulation environment, which is one of the best and the most famous complex and multi-agent large-scale environments, was selected. The environment simulates the incidence of fire and earthquakes in urban areas where it is the duty of the police forces, firefighters and ambulance teams to control the crisis. Firefighters of SOS team are first modeled and implemented by utilizing C-RPD and then the system is trained using an expert’s experience. There are two evaluations. To find out the convergence of different versions developed during experience adding, some of the developed versions are chosen and evaluated on seven maps. Results show performance improvements.

Recent ABMs provide compelling accounts of group pattern formation, contagion and cooperation, and can be used to predict, manipulate and improve upon collective behavior.

The alternative advocated here is that individuals participate in collective organizations that they might not understand or even perceive, and that these organizations affect and are affected by individual behavior.}

The proposed denotational model is the first one that supports the full features of a quantum functional programming language; we prove adequacy of our semantics. The construction of our model is by a series of existing techniques taken from the semantics of classical computation as well as from process theory. The most notable among them is Girard's Geometry of Interaction (GoI), categorically formulated by Abramsky, Haghverdi and Scott. The mathematical genericity of these techniques—largely due to their categorical formulation—is exploited for our move from classical to quantum.}

In this paper we offer a new perspective on optic ataxia; we argue that the popular characterisation of this disorder is misleading and is unrepresentative of the pattern of reaching errors typically observed in OA patients. We begin our paper by reviewing recent neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and functional brain imaging studies that have led to the proposal that the medial parietal cortex in the vicinity of the parietal-occipital junction (POJ) – the key anatomical site associated with OA – represents reaching movements in eye-centred coordinates, and that this ability is impaired in optic ataxia. Our perspective stresses the importance of the POJ and superior parietal regions of the human PPC for representing reaching movements in both extrinsic (eye-centred) and intrinsic (postural) coordinates, and proposes that it is the ability to simultaneously represent multiple spatial locations that must be directly compared with one another that is impaired in non-foveal OA patients. In support of this idea we review recent fMRI and behavioural studies conducted by our group that have investigated the anatomical correlates of posturally guided movements, and the movements guided by postural cues in patients presenting with optic ataxia.}

Our model is based on the model of Marinier, Laird, and Lewis (2009). We modified it by increasing the agent’s visual field, adding a GOFAI-style cognitive module (sub-goal management) and expanding the environment by a high-threat tile, to which the agent responds with a hard-wired automatic reaction. This allowed us to generate and observe different types of behavior and study interesting interactions between cognitive and affective control. By comparing our re-implementation to the modified agent, we demonstrated clear cases of Type 1 (fast, automatic) and Type 2 (slow, deliberative) behavior, providing further evidence for the “single-system, two processes” hypothesis.}

abstract = {Improving the flexible and deep peak shaving capability of supercritical (SC) unit under full operating conditions to adapt a larger-scale renewable energy integrated into the power grid is the main choice of novel power system. However, it is particularly challenging to establish an accurate SC unit model under large-scale variable loads and deep peak shaving. To this end, a data-driven modeling strategy combining Transformer-Extra Long (Transformer-XL) and quantum chaotic nutcracker optimization algorithm is proposed. Firstly, three models of the SC unit under once-through/recirculation/shut-down are built via analyzing its mechanism of the operation process, respectively. Secondly, the superior performance of Transformer-XL in obtaining global feature information is employed to effectively solve the problem of high information dependence caused by the strong coupling and nonlinearity of SC unit. Then, the improved quantum chaotic nutcracker optimization algorithm with higher search accuracy is proposed to obtain the optimal parameters of Transformer-XL based on the logistic chaotic mapping and quantum thinking. Feature information dependencies and optimal parameter settings are fully considered in the proposed modeling scheme, which results in an accurate model of SC unit under full operating conditions. Finally, various simulations and comparisons are conducted based on the on-site data of 600 MW SC unit to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed data-driven modeling strategy. According to the improved Transformer-XL, the mean square errors of the proposed SC unit model under once-through/recirculation/shut-down modes are less than 2.500E-03, which verifies the high accuracy of the model. Consequently, the developed model is suitable for application in the controller designing and the operating efficiency and flexibility improvement of SC unit.}

abstract = {This paper addresses the implications of an emerging, increasingly important way of thinking about markets: systems thinking. A market is one of the most founational abstractions in marketing and business research; yet, it often receives too little attention. As a result, the taken-for-granted assumptions about markets spur from over-simplified conceptualizations of neoclassical economics that depict markets as static and mechanistic. Systems thinking represents a major change in perspective that involves transcending this mechanistic worldview and thinking instead in terms of wholes, relationships, processes, and patterns. We argue that building a theory of markets based on systems thinking, would enable scholars to develop more realistic models that correspond with fast-changing business environment and therefore, increase both the rigor and relevance of future research. To further this aim, we identify the main implications of systems thinking and formulate them into a research agenda to further the systemic understanding of markets.}

abstract = {The method of caustics is a powerful experimental method in elasticity and particularly in fracture mechanics for crack problems. The related method of pseudocaustics is also of interest. Here we apply the computational method of quantifier elimination implemented in the computer algebra system Mathematica in order to determine (i) the non-parametric equation and two properties of the caustic at a crack tip and especially (ii) the illuminated and the dark regions related to caustics and pseudocaustics in plane elasticity and plate problems. The present computations concern: (i) The derivation of the non-parametric equation of the classical caustic about a crack tip through the elimination of the parameter involved (here the polar angle) as well as two geometrical properties of this caustic. (ii) The derivation of the inequalities defining the illuminated region on the screen in the problem of an elastic half-plane loaded normally by a concentrated load with the boundary of this illuminated region related to some extent to the caustic formed. (iii) Similarly for the problem of a clamped circular plate under a uniform loading with respect to the caustic and the pseudocaustic formed. (iv) Analogously for the problem of an equilateral triangular plate loaded by uniformly distributed moments along its whole boundary, which defines the related pseudocaustic. (v) The determination of quantities of interest in mechanics from the obtained caustics or pseudocaustics. The kind of computations in the applications (ii) to (iv), i.e. the derivation of inequalities defining the illuminated region on the screen, seems to be completely new independently of the use here of the method of quantifier elimination. Additional applications are also possible, but some of them require the expansion of the present somewhat limited power of the quantifier elimination algorithms in Mathematica. This is expected to take place in the future.}

Sixty-four middle school children participated in Scratch-based, math game making activities. Data were collected via activity and conversation observation, artifact analysis, interviewing, and survey. The study findings indicated that participants developed significantly more positive dispositions toward mathematics after computer game making. The study also found that experience-driven game design processes helped to activate children's reflection on everyday mathematical experiences. Mathematical thinking and content experience were intertwined within the process of computer game authoring. On the other hand, children designers were involved in game-world and story crafting more than mathematical representation. And it was still challenging for them to perform computer game coding with abstract reasoning.}

abstract = {This paper reviews studies of proposed creative machines applied to a prototypical creative task, i.e., the Alternative Uses Task (AUT). Although one system (OROC) did simulate some aspects of human strategies for the AUT, most recent attempts have not been simulation-oriented, but rather have used Large Language Model (LLM) systems such as GPT-3 which embody extremely large connectionist networks trained on huge volumes of textual data. Studies reviewed here indicate that LLM based systems are performing on the AUT at near or somewhat above human levels in terms of scores on originality and usefulness. Moreover, similar patterns are found in the data of humans and LLM models in the AUT, such as output order effects and a negative association between originality and value or utility. However, it is concluded that GPT-3 and similar systems, despite generating novel and useful responses, do not display creativity as they lack agency and are purely algorithmic. LLM studies so far in this area have largely been exploratory and future studies should guard against possible training data contamination.}

Although models of PFC function are abundant, most fail to capture the complexity of this part of the brain. Here we argue that an improved understanding of the evolution of PFC can aid in the formulation of better models. By better understanding what PFC is, why it evolved, and what benefit it provided to our ancestors, we can constrain our thinking and put the plethora of neuroimaging data showing PFC activation into context.}

Drawing upon survey and interview research conducted at two liberal arts institutions, the authors investigate student writing practices across several undergraduate mathematics courses that required the use of LaTeX (a common markup language allowing users to specify the appearance of text and its layout on the printed page). This article presents findings about how the use of LaTeX slowed down students’ writing process, encouraging greater revision and reflection as well as allowing students to identify errors in their work at more than one stage in the process. We also explore the affective learning outcomes of STEM students using typesetting software, including increased feelings of confidence and professionalization. This article seeks to contribute to the growing conversation about how STEM students transfer knowledge about writing across disciplines.}

Darwin's “simple beginning” may be identified, in today's terminology, with dissipation—evolution's basic fuel. All the rest is commentary—or, more precisely, corollary. One can aptly apply Darwin's phrase to another kind of “simple beginning,” from which as well “endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.” What I have in mind is a concept that is apparently the very antithesis of dissipation, namely, physics' fundamental assumption of invertibility—or “microscopic reversibility.” To paraphrase Dobzhansky, no sensible step can be taken today in information, communication, and computer sciences, as well as in fundamental physics, except in the light of invertibility.}
