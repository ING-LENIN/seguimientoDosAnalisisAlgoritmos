N2 - This study investigated teachers’ use of knowledge from research on children’s mathematical thinking and how their students’ achievement is influenced as a result. Twenty first grade teachers, assigned randomly to an experimental treatment, participated in a month-long workshop in which they studied a research-based analysis of children’s development of problem-solving skills in addition and subtraction. Other first grade teachers (n = 20) were assigned randomly to a control group. Although instructional practices were not prescribed, experimental teachers taught problem solving significantly more and number facts significantly less than did control teachers. Experimental teachers encouraged students to use a variety of problem-solving strategies, and they listened to processes their students used significantly more than did control teachers. Experimental teachers knew more about individual students’ problem-solving processes, and they believed that instruction should build on students’ existing knowledge more than did control teachers. Students in experimental classes exceeded students in control classes in number fact knowledge, problem solving, reported understanding, and reported confidence in their problem-solving abilities.

N2 - Critical thinking about international politics often involves reasoning about the beliefs, goals, appraisals, actions, and plans of actors such as countries, governments, politicians, etc. We analyzed arguments in interpretive reports about international politics, in order to develop a prototype argument diagramming tool for this domain, AVIZE (Argument Visualization and Evaluation). The purpose of AVIZE is to aid users in the construction and self-evaluation of real-world arguments in the domain of international politics. AVIZE provides a set of argument schemes as cognitive building blocks for constructing argument diagrams. Most of the schemes are related to concepts from the field of automated plan recognition in artificial intelligence. While some currently available argument diagramming tools provide schemes, they are not tailored to the domain of international politics. This paper describes the argument schemes for this domain and the design of the argument diagramming tool.

N2 - The Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015 mandates that English language proficiency (ELP) standards align with content standards. As the fast-growing population of English learners (ELs) is expected to meet college- and career-ready content standards, the purpose of this article is to highlight key issues in aligning ELP standards with content standards. The overarching question is how to align ELP standards with academically rigorous and language-intensive disciplinary practices of content standards while respecting and maintaining the nature of the discipline within each area. I begin by describing contributions and shortcomings of content standards and ELP standards. Next, I propose consideration of three components in aligning ELP standards with content standards: (a) norms of disciplinary practices across content areas, (b) developmental progressions of disciplinary practices across K–12 grade levels or bands and across content areas, and (c) language use across levels of English proficiency. For each component, the challenges in establishing alignment and potential trade-offs in addressing these challenges are discussed. Finally, I highlight how these challenges present opportunities for substantive collaboration between EL education and content areas to move these fields forward and ensure ELs achieve academically rigorous content standards while developing ELP.

N2 - Background: Mobile devices have been impacting on human standard of living by providing timely and accurate information anywhere and anytime through wireless media in developing nations. Shortage of experts in medical fields is very obvious throughout the whole world but more pronounced in developing nations. Objective: Thus, this study proposes a telemedicine platform for the vulnerable areas of developing nations. The vulnerable area are the interior with little or no medical facilities, hence the dwellers are very susceptible to sicknesses and diseases. Methods: The framework uses mobile devices that can run LightWeight Agents (LWAs) to send consultation requests to a remote medical expert in urban city from the vulnerable interiors. The feedback is conveyed to the requester through the same medium. The system architecture which contained AgenRoller, LWAs, The front-end (mobile devices) and back-end (the medical server) is presented. The algorithm for the software component of the architecture (AgenRoller) is also presented. The system is modeled as M/M/1/c queuing system, and simulated using Simevents from MATLAB Simulink environment. Result: The simulation result presented show the average queue length, the number of entities in the queue and the number of entities departure from the system. These together present the rate of information processing in the system. Conclusion: A full scale development of this system with proper implementation will help extend the few medical facilities available in the urban cities in developing nations to the interiors thereby reducing the number of casualties in the vulnerable areas of the developing world especially in Sub Saharan Africa.

N2 - Recent work by Amso and Johnson (Developmental Psychology, 42(6), 1236—1245, 2006) implicates the role of visual selective attention in the development of perceptual completion during early infancy. In the current article, we extend this finding by simulating the performance of 3-month-old infants on a visual search task, using a multi-channel, image-filtering model of early visual processing. Model parameters were systematically varied to simulate developmental change in three neural components of visual selective attention: degree of oculomotor noise, growth of horizontal connections in visual cortex, and duration of recurrent processing in parietal cortex. While two of the three components—horizontal connections and recurrent parietal processing—are each able to account for the visual search performance of 3-month-olds, recurrent parietal processing also suggests a coherent pattern of developmental change in visual selective attention during early infancy. We conclude by highlighting plausible neural mechanisms for modulating recurrent parietal activity, including the development of feedback from prefrontal cortex.

N2 - The purpose of the present study was to examine and compare Singaporean physical education teachers’ attitudes towards information and communication technologies in physical education across different demographic groups that included gender, age, teaching experience, and school level. A total of 422 Singaporean full-time physical education teachers (mean age = 38.47 years, standard deviation = 8.31) completed the Physical Education Teachers’ Subjective Theories Questionnaire to assess their perspectives towards the integration of information and communication technologies into physical education teaching practice. Mann–Whitney U and Kruskal–Wallis H tests were conducted to examine the differences in participants’ attitudes across different demographic groups. Results revealed that attitudes towards information and communication technologies significantly differed between teachers of different gender, age, and teaching experience. However, no significant difference was found in attitudes towards information and communication technologies among teachers of different school levels. The findings of this study can inform policy-makers and stakeholders with an interest in promoting the integration of information and communication technologies in physical education.

N2 - This article introduces a generative model of category representation that uses computer vision methods to extract category-consistent features (CCFs) directly from images of category exemplars. The model was trained on 4,800 images of common objects, and CCFs were obtained for 68 categories spanning subordinate, basic, and superordinate levels in a category hierarchy. When participants searched for these same categories, targets cued at the subordinate level were preferentially fixated, but fixated targets were verified faster when they followed a basic-level cue. The subordinate-level advantage in guidance is explained by the number of target-category CCFs, a measure of category specificity that decreases with movement up the category hierarchy. The basic-level advantage in verification is explained by multiplying the number of CCFs by sibling distance, a measure of category distinctiveness. With this model, the visual representations of real-world object categories, each learned from the vast numbers of image exemplars accumulated throughout everyday experience, can finally be studied.
