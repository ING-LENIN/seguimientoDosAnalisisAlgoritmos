In this study, through experiment and calculation, the effects of the geometric configuration of exhaust manifold on flow structure and its maldistribution in the monolith were mainly investigated to understand the exhaust flow patterns in terms of flow uniformity and to obtain the better light-off for further emission reduction. On the basis of the design guidance resulting from this fundamental study, an improved exhaust manifold (type II) was designed and manufactured.

abstract = {The objective of data compression is to avoid redundancy in order to reduce the size of the data to be stored or transmitted. In some scenarios, data compression may help to increase global performance by reducing the amount of data at a competitive cost in terms of global time and energy consumption. We have introduced computational compression as a technique for reducing redundant computation, in other words, to avoid carrying out the same computation with the same input to obtain the same output. In some scenarios, such as simulations, graphic processing, and so on, part of the computation is repeated using the same input in order to obtain the same output, and this computation could have an important cost in terms of global time and energy consumption. We propose applying computational compression by using memoization in order to store the results for future reuse and, in this way, minimize the use of the same costly computation. Although memoization was proposed for sequential applications in the 1980s, and there are some projects that have applied it in very specific domains, we propose a novel, domain-independent way of using it in high-performance applications, as a means of avoiding redundant computation.}

abstract = {In this paper, we describe some of the current issues in computational sign language processing. Despite the seeming similarities between computational spoken language and sign language processing, signed languages have intrinsic properties that pose some very difficult problems. These include a high level of simultaneous actions, the intersection between signs and gestures, and the complexity of modeling grammatical processes. Additional problems are posed by the difficulties that computers face in extracting reliable information on the hands and the face from video images. So far, no single research group or company has managed to tackle all the hard problems and produced a real working system for analysis and recognition. We present a summary of our research into sign language recognition and how it interacts with sign language linguistics. We propose solutions to some of the aforementioned problems, and also discuss what problems are still unsolved. In addition, we summarize the current state of the art in our sign language recognition and facial expression analysis frameworks.}

abstract = {Cold surfaces may cause thermal discomfort due to down draught and/or infrared radiation exchange. In this paper a cold vertical surface of 3m height in a room (3 × 3 × 5m3) was investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Also calculated were a parameter that expresses thermal discomfort for the whole human body – the predicted percentage of (those people) dissatisfied – and parameters of local discomfort such as air speed and draft risk. Five cases with different heat loads (0–80Wm−2) and with/without furniture were simulated, each case with three different temperatures of the cold surface (17.5, 15, and 10°C). The mean operative temperature was approximately 20°C in all cases. It was found that with respect to thermal discomfort, draught was more critical than reduced operative temperatures or radiation asymmetry. An increase of the heat load in the room leads to higher down draught air speeds. Therefore, experiments performed in empty rooms tend to underestimate the maximum air speed that occurs in real, furnished rooms with heat loads. A set of correlations for maximum air speed within the occupied zone is proposed. Additionally, this study shows that CFD is a valuable technique to complement and broaden knowledge gained in laboratory experiments in the field of thermal comfort.}

abstract = {The capability to accurately model fluid flow within rotating Taylor–Couette systems has a primary role in informing computational investigations of rotating machinery. There is considerable uncertainty regarding selection of modelling approach, including a suitable turbulence model, that can accurately resolve turbulence within such complex flows while remaining computationally feasible for industrially relevant applications. This paper presents a numerical comparison of axisymmetric and three-dimensional unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (URANS) turbulence models within ANSYS Fluent. The CFD geometries are representative of ones for which there are published experimental measurements. For the Taylor–Couette study, investigation into inner cylinder start-up procedure, based on previous published findings, confirmed that the final state of the flow is highly dependent on the initial conditions and acceleration rate. Once Taylor vortices form and stabilise, they are not disrupted by small steps in inner cylinder speed, allowing computationally efficient accelerations. Investigations into applying rotational periodicity were unsuccessful, resulting in a significantly reduced core velocity. Axisymmetric predictions provided reasonable agreement with experimental data only at low rotation rates. A good prediction of the velocity flow field was obtained for three-dimensional simulations of the full 360° domain with differences of less than 5% for radial velocities. Among the URANS models, the standard k-ω model and baseline Reynolds stress model (BSL-RSM) provided the closest agreement to published experimental data. In the paper, the developed Taylor–Couette turbulence modelling methodology is extended to a bearing chamber geometry. Analysis of the secondary vortex flow field is compared both qualitatively and quantitatively to published bearing chamber experimental measurements. Overall, whilst a good agreement is still found using the standard k-ω turbulence model, discrepancies arise with the BSL-RSM. However, for this more complex bearing chamber environment compared to a Taylor–Couette flow, the shear stress transport k-ω turbulence model provided the closest agreement and is recommended for future bearing chamber modelling.}

abstract = {This article describes a computational system for the linguistic analysis of language acquisition data (COALA). The system is a combined AI and database tool which allows the user to form highly complex queries about morphosyntactic and semantic structures contained in large sets of data. COALA identifies those sentences that meet the linguistic criteria defined by the user. It allows the user to freely define such linguistic contexts and to step through the sentences identified by the system. COALA then rapidly displays those sentences in their original discourse context. Additionally, COALA can perform statistical analyses in response to structural linguistic queries. This article contains (1) a discussion of the computational approach taken in the design of COALA, (2) a description of the functionality of the system, and (3) a reflection on the validity of the analytical categories contained therein.}

abstract = {This paper uses Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics to study trailing edge noise reduction with 3-D finlets. Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computational fluid dynamics provides boundary layer parameters near a trailing edge for an empirical wall pressure spectrum model, and then an acoustic model predicts far-field noise based on pressure fluctuations obtained from the wall pressure spectrum model. First, this numerical approach is validated against experiments. Second, a comprehensive trend analysis is conducted to give insight into the design of 3-D finlets under different flow conditions. A data-driven turbulence spanwise length scale model is developed to tackle finlets with small spacing. Combined with acoustic results, detailed computational flow field results are analyzed to understand the physical mechanism of noise reduction. While the major part of the proposed mechanism is the same as prior work, several new observations are shown which better understand the physical mechanism of noise reduction with 3-D finlets. The goals of the current paper are to provide an efficient Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes-based approach to predict trailing edge noise of 3-D finlets, to give complete trend analysis results with various finlets under different flow conditions, and to advance an understanding of the underlying physics.}

abstract = {The Reynolds equation, in which some items have been omitted, is a simplified form of the Navier–Stokes equations. When surface texturing exists, it may unreasonably reveal the tribological effects in some cases. In this paper, both the two-dimensional computational fluid dynamics method, which is based on the Navier–Stokes equations, and the corresponding one-dimensional Reynolds method are adopted to analyze the performance of the textured piston compression ring conjunction. To conduct a comparison between these two methods, the modified Elrod algorithm for Jakobsson–Floberg–Olsson cavitation model is chosen to solve the Reynolds equation. The results show that the Reynolds method is somewhat different from the computational fluid dynamics method in the minimum oil film thickness, pressure distribution, and cavitation at given operating conditions. Moreover, for a low ratio of texture depth to length, the Reynolds equation is still suitable to predict the overall effects of the designed groove textures. The simulation results also reveal that it is not always beneficial for the tribological performance and sometimes may increase the total friction force when the ring is textured.}
