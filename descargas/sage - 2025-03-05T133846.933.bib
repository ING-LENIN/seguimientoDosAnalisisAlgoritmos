abstract = {This article suggests to quantitative methodologists that the tools that they use (and often others they do not) are more broadly applicable than is often assumed; to reflexivist researchers that there are many more tools available to their research than are often seen as appropriate; and to the IR discipline writ large that most of the disciplinary thinking about the relationships between research, ontology, epistemology, methodology and methods is unnecessarily narrow. Our core goal is to reveal the problematically inaccurate nature of both the qualitative/quantitative and the positivist/post-positivist divides, as well as of traditional methods training. We suggest that the ability to pair, and the utility of pairing, quantitative (traditionally neopositivist) methods with critical (traditionally non-neopositivist) theorising makes this intervention. To this end, the article begins with discussions of the relationships between epistemology and method in IR research. We continue on to frame a disunity of social science in the quantitative/qualitative divide, which lays the groundwork for a section rethinking traditional understandings of how methods, methodology, and epistemology relate. We then make the case for the utility of methods traditionally classified as ‘quantitative’ for critical research in IR. The article concludes by discussing the transformative implications of this understanding for critical theorising, and for theorising knowledge within disciplinary IR.}

abstract = {A complementary computational approach is proposed for the time-varying Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy model system (TVTSFMS). The proposed approach integrates orthogonal-functional approach (OFA), hybrid Taguchi genetic algorithm (HTGA), and a stabilizability condition (SC) for use in designing stable and quadratic-optimal parallel-distributed-compensation (SQOPDC) controllers for optimal control problems. First, the SC was set according to linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Next, OFA was used to derive an algorithm that only required algebraic computation to solve the TVTSFMS. Finally, The HTGA could be used to search the SQOPDC controller for the TVTSFMS. The SQOPDC controller obtained by the proposed complementary computational approach was evaluated in a case study of a vibratory pendulum design; the successful design verified the usability of the proposed hybrid intelligent computing method.}

abstract = {The treatment of fractional differential equations and fractional optimal control problems is more difficult to tackle than the standard integer-order counterpart and may pose problems to non-specialists. Due to this reason, the analytical and numerical methods proposed in the literature may be applied incorrectly. Often, such methods were established for the classical integer-order operators and are then applied directly without having in mind the restrictions posed by their fractional-order versions. It was recently reported that the Cole–Hopf transformation can be used to convert the time-fractional nonlinear Burgers’ equation into the time-fractional linear heat equation. In this article, we show that, unlike integer-order differential equations, employing the Cole–Hopf transformation for reducing the nonlinear time-fractional Burgers’ equation into the time-fractional heat equation is wrong from two different perspectives. Indeed, such a reduction is accomplished using incorrect transcripts of the Leibniz or chain rules. Hence, providing numerical or analytical schemes based on the Cole–Hopf transformation leads to erroneous results for the nonlinear time-fractional Burgers’ equation. Regarding constant-order, variable-order, and distributed-order Caputo fractional optimal problems, we note an inconsistency in the necessary optimality conditions derived in the literature. The transversality conditions were introduced as identical to those for the integer-order case, with a vanishing multiplier at the terminal of the interval. The correct condition should involve a constant-order, variable-order, or distributed-order fractional integral operator. We also deduce that if the control system is defined with a Caputo derivative, then the adjoint equations should be expressed in the Riemann–Liouville sense and vice versa. In fact, neglecting some terms in the integration by parts formulae, during the derivation of the optimality conditions, causes some confusion in the literature.}

abstract = {Utilizing a nationally representative sample of middle school students, this article focuses on whether students who report experiencing more inquiry-based instruction in science and mathematics classrooms have more positive attitudes toward these subjects. Results of multilevel, multivariate regression analyses revealed that, net of the inclusion of control variables for student, teacher, and school characteristics, a higher frequency of inquiry-based instruction is significantly associated with greater interest, perceptions of utility, and self-efficacy for science and mathematics. Furthermore, although there is some evidence indicating that compared with female students, male students’ perceptions of science utility are higher in relation to more inquiry-based instruction, overall, the weight of evidence clearly leans toward the conclusion that the attitudes of students from different gender and racial/ethnic backgrounds are similarly associated with greater exposure to inquiry-based instruction in both their science and mathematics classrooms.}

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of a compression—ignition (CI) heavy-duty engine fuelled with diesel and gasoline-like fuels. A state-of-the-art engine computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool was used to explore the influences of the physical and chemical properties of diesel and gasoline-like fuels (no. 91 gasoline and E10) on spray development, auto-ignition and combustion processes, and pollutant formation. The CFD simulation results were found to be consistent with available experimental measurements, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate that gasoline-like fuels are able to achieve better premixed charge in CI engines owing to their higher volatility and lower ignitability compared to diesel fuel, which promotes efficient, clean, and low temperature combustion. However, the high combustion pressure rise rate becomes problematic under some circumstances, especially for high octane number fuels, such as E10. Both previous experimental measurements and the present numerical results show that gasoline-like fuels have great potential to be used in future CI engines, but the injection strategies and injection system have to be optimized based on the fuel properties.}
