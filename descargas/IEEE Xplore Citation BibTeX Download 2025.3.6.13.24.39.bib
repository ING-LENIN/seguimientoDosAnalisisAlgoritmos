  abstract={Quantum mechanics is a revolutionary scientific field, which lies at the crossroad section of Physics, Mathematics, Computer and Computational Science. In essence, it is considered a cross-disciplinary STEM field, advancing the philosophy of Quantum Literacy (QL), which addresses the transdisciplinary nature of real world complex problems. QL addresses the challenges of learning and skills acquisition, through specific computing activities, within a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners. It is therefore important that quantum computing and quantum technologies knowledge is accessible to students and teachers who work with real problems, in a more inclusive and interactive way. In this paper, we argue for the necessity of exposing students to new and powerful quantum tools, as provided by cutting edge quantum computing technologies. We do that by proposing contemporary and STEM related activities and gamification scenarios, in which they acquire stronger mathematical and computational - problem decomposition and modelling skills, working as real researchers. By engaging students in games and activities related to quantum computing and quantum information processing, they acquire all necessary knowledge related to: superposition, teleportation, entanglement, quantum gates and quantum information. The serious games proposed in this paper relates to quantum strategic games, necessary for STEM activities to train students within the computational thinking 2.0 framework. All scenarios were implemented using the didactic model of inquiry-based learning using Python libraries.},

  title={Using Topic Modeling to Extract Pre-Service Teachers’ Understandings of Computational Thinking From Their Coding Reflections}, 
  year={2019},
  volume={62},
  number={4},
  pages={325-332},
  abstract={Contribution: This paper employs the automatic scoring of short essays as a novel way to determine pre-service teachers' knowledge of and attitudes toward computational thinking (CT) from their written reflections. Implications about designing CT courses for pre-service teachers are discussed. Background: CT is an essential 21st-century competency that supports the development of problem-solving skills. Inspired by computing science problem-solving practices, CT should transcend disciplines, but few universities or colleges include CT courses or CT content in their core courses. It is also difficult to know what pre-service teachers think about CT and their role in promoting it. Research Questions: Do pre-service teachers' coding reflections reveal any important information about their knowledge of, skills in, and attitudes toward CT? Methodology: Traditional qualitative techniques based on human raters are impractical in analyzing hundreds of essays. Topic modeling, an unsupervised machine learning modeling technique, was employed to extract topical features from participants' reflections. In one section of an undergraduate Introduction to Educational Technology course offered at a large university in Western Canada, n = 139 pre-service teachers wrote a short reflection on their experience following a 20 h Accelerated Intro to Computer Science Code.org course. Topics were identified by analyzing contextual trends in participants' written reflections. Findings: Results showed that pre-service teachers' reflections included CT concepts, practices, and perspectives. Specifically, participants connected the coding activity to prior knowledge and experiences.},

  abstract={This paper presents a simultaneous optimization method of a case-based reasoning (CBR) system using a genetic algorithm (GA) for product designing. Prior research proposed many hybrid models of CBR and the GA for product design. However, those models were not good at aiding at creative designing. In this study, CBR and GA combine with a algorithm process for simulation of directed similarity association according to human being's thought models. Experimental results show that the new hybrid model outperforms other conventional approaches for creative design.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This work in progress paper in the research-to-practice category focuses on high school students planning to enter a new learning environment for transition. Prospective students benefit from structured programming that considers two factors. First, the college knowledge required to navigate day-to-day logistics including new living arrangements, supporting physical & mental health, and funding the experience. Second, STEM curricula and challenges students from extremely rural communities face in identifying with these rigorous programs. The work of influential researchers in student transition and retention along with contextual findings from a large, rural state in the Rocky Mountain region informed the redesign of an engineering college's outreach program. This paper has two purposes. First, it details how established theories combined with research findings and assessment can create robust models to support keeping recruitment programs relevant. Second, it provides an example of how a model was developed and then used to redesign and assess an outreach program using college peer mentors to support high school-aged students interested in engineering and computing disciplines.},

EA have been used in different musical applications, ranging from new systems for composition and performance, to models for studying musical evolution in artificial societies. This paper starts with a brief introduction to three main fields of application of EA in music, namely sound design, creativity and computational musicology. Then it presents our work in the field of computational musicology. Computational musicology is broadly defined as the study of music with computational modelling and simulation. We are interested in developing A-Life-based models to study the evolution of musical cognition in an artificial society of agents. In this paper we present the main components of a model that we are developing to study the evolution of musical ontogenies, focusing on the evolution of rhythms and emotional systems. The paper concludes by suggesting that A-Life and EA provide a powerful paradigm for computational musicology},

The cyber security industry has disparate ways of recruiting its workforce owing to the prevailing educational system and diverse work roles in the field of cyber security. Comparison is drawn between the old and revised models of Bloom’s taxonomy to depict which model best represents the dynamic learning objectives and outcomes of cyber security education. A rubric is designed from the Dreyfus et al model of skill acquisition based on the iterations of Bloom’s taxonomy to assess cyber security competencies to achieve mastery. To bridge the skills gaps in the industry, Bloom’s taxonomy provides the impetus to align the needs of industry with educational programs [1].},

  abstract={RoblockLLy is an educational robotics simulator designed for primary and secondary school students, whose goal is to increase their interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. In the particular case of computer science, it allows developing computational thinking skills. It has been designed with ease of use in mind. This free tool is available through a web browser and does not need a complex installation or specific hardware requirements, allowing educational robotics to be introduced to a wide range of users by working on practical projects that will help them understand key concepts of robotics and programming. The effectiveness of RoblockLLy has been validated based on motivation, usability, and user experience criteria. The tool was validated with 212 secondary school students (12–16 years old). Specifically, motivation was measured with the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory, usability with the System Usability Scale, and user experience with the User Experience Questionnaire. Generally speaking, the results demonstrate that students perceived RoblockLLy as a novel and interesting tool. The ratings for usability were predominantly positive, although a few students indicated a preference for expert assistance. The overall rating of the user experience was positive as well, yet notable differences in attitudes toward motivation and usability were observed between genders.},

  abstract={Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths. Low-dose computed tomography (CT)screening has been shown to significantly reduce lung cancer mortality but suffers from a high false positive rate that leads to unnecessary diagnostic procedures. The development of deep learning techniques has the potential to help improve lung cancer screening technology. Here we present the algorithm, DeepScreener, which can predict a patient's cancer status from a volumetric lung CT scan. DeepScreener is based on our model of Spatial Pyramid Pooling, which ranked 16th of 1972 teams (top 1 percent)in the Data Science Bowl 2017 competition (DSB2017), evaluated with the challenge datasets. Here we test the algorithm with an independent set of 1449 low-dose CT scans of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)cohort, and we find that DeepScreener has consistent performance of high accuracy. Furthermore, by combining Spatial Pyramid Pooling and 3D Convolution, it achieves an AUC of 0.892, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art algorithms using only 3D convolution. The advancement of deep learning algorithms can potentially help improve lung cancer detection with low-dose CT scans.},

  abstract={This research category paper examines the impact of computational thinking within first-year engineering courses on student pathways into engineering. Computational thinking and programming appear in many introductory engineering courses. Prior work found that early computational thinking development is critical to the formation of engineers. This qualitative research paper extends the research by documenting how pre-university privileges impact first-year student trajectories into engineering through a qualitative examination of student interviews from three institutions with different processes for matriculation into engineering majors. We identify the underlying assumptions of meritocracy that are concealing the role of educational privilege in selecting which engineering students will be allowed to join the field. We provide a suggestion for how institutions can include computational thinking in introductory engineering courses with less risk of furthering the marginalization of students with few academic privileges.},

  abstract={This study explores the impact of online collaborative knowledge construction on Deeper Learning among university students. Utilizing Social Network Analysis (SNA) and Epistemic Network Analysis (ENA), we examined interaction behaviors and cognitive development in a foundational computer science course. Data were collected from a Chinese university over nine weeks, involving two experimental phases. The analysis categorized students into core and peripheral groups based on centrality metrics, revealing significant differences in their engagement and learning levels. Core group members demonstrated higher cognitive development and problem-solving abilities, with dense connections in higher-order cognitive stages. In contrast, peripheral group members showed limited interaction and basic cognitive outcomes. The findings emphasize the critical role of collaboration and communication in fostering Deeper Learning, suggesting the need for educational institutions to adopt new teaching methods and technologies. By promoting high-order cognition and collaborative learning, educators can enhance students' critical thinking, innovation, and problem-solving skills, ultimately contributing to a dynamic and enriched learning environment.},

  abstract={This paper investigates how to increase understanding of design and sustainable systems by scaffolding cognitive access and transfer of learning using eclectic approaches to experiment with networks of design potentials. Cognitive access simulates multi-criteria case indexing, refined from knowledge induction derived from analyses of random but related cases based on search strategies. Randomization of the search space encourages emergence of heuristic solutions, fuzzy though informed transfers and further refinement of schema. We investigate the type of navigational structures/design resulting from creative reuse/refactoring and lean management; and whether there will be evidences of knowledge induction from randomized search scaffolded by Case-based Reasoning (CBR), which leads to heuristic transfer and learning. Examples from two courses carried out August-December 2017 within the participatory design-agile framework for engagement in Smart Cities are assessed for creative reuse regarding: a) people, process and tools; b) domain engineering; c) component mining and d) open source vs. systematic reuse. Findings confirm longitudinal insights: CBR-informed but emergent search leading to more efficient and higher quality heuristic transfer and learning is scaffolded by systemic modelling and design dependent on four factors.},

  abstract={While preparing students for careers beyond graduation, HBCU faculty often have to balance the priorities of bridging the gap between the level of student preparation and the expected level of preparedness as influenced by industry and discipline standards. Prioritization of these standards does not always align with the experience of students at Historically Black College and Universities (HBCU) and Minority Serving Institutions (MSI). The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) 2013 Computer Science Curricula guidelines highlight version control as one of many core tools in the Social Issues and Professional Practice (SP) Knowledge Area students should experience in their upper-level software engineering courses. Research has demonstrated that at this level, students receive exposure to the tool but are not able to gain sufficient mastery. Other researchers have advocated for version control being introduced earlier in the computer science curricula. There is limited research that indicates that this particular tool improves the learning outcomes for students or significantly complements the other ACM Knowledge Areas. This paper explores the challenges experienced by an HBCU faculty member while integrating GitHub into an advanced programming class. It is important to note, there is no research that directly addresses the use of version control in predominately African American classrooms.},

  abstract={Creative thinking is one of the hallmarks of human-level competence. Although it is still a poorly understood subject speculative ideas about brain processes involved in creative thinking may be implemented in computational models. A review of different approaches to creativity, insight and intuition is presented. Two factors are essential for creativity: imagination and selection or filtering. Imagination should be constrained by experience, while filtering in the case of creative use of words may be based on semantic and phonological associations. Analysis of brain processes involved in invention of new words leads to practical algorithms that create many interesting and novel names associated with a set of keywords.},

  abstract={With the introduction of computer programming in schools around the world, a myriad of guides are being published to support educators who are teaching this subject, often for the first time. Most of these books offer a learning path based on the experience of the experts who author them. In this paper we propose and investigate an alternative way of determining the most suitable learning paths by analyzing projects developed by learners hosted in public repositories. Therefore, we downloaded 250 projects of different types from the Scratch online platform, and identified the differences and clustered them based on a quantitative measure, the computational thinking score provided by Dr. Scratch. We then triangulated the results by qualitatively studying in detail the source code of the prototypical projects to explain the progression required to move from one cluster to the next one. The result is a data-driven itinerary that can support teachers and policy makers in the creation of a curriculum for learning to program. Aiming to generalize this approach, we discuss a potential recommender tool, populated with data from public repositories, to allow educators and learners creating their own learning paths, contributing thus to a personalized learning connected with students' interests.},

  abstract={The Computational Thinking (CT) conceptual framework is entering its second decade of research yet still lacks a cohesive definition by which the field can coalesce. The lack of clear definition makes assessment tool challenging to formulate, pedagogical efforts difficult to compare, and research difficult to synthesize. This paper looks to operationalize differing definitions of CT enhancing the ability to teach then assess the presence of CT. Expanding upon CT definitions, industry practices and processes, and educational theory, we link existing concepts and propose a new element to model an active definition of CT as a theoretical framework to guide future research. Our model updates existing CT definition by formally including Modeling, introducing Socio-Technical processes, separating Information Gathering from Data Collection and adding emphasis to Testing as a vital CT concept. We feel these elements and interconnections make CT is easier to describe and measure.},

  abstract={This research-to-practice full paper deals with the difficulty that it is possible to teach computational thinking through the teaching of algorithms and programming to a person with ADD. We propose approaches to teach algorithms, knowing that it is a difficult task for many teachers. Likewise, inspiring the student's interest also has its difficulties. The Brazilian Computer Society (SBC) understands that it is fundamental and strategic for Brazil that computer content is taught in basic education. Considering the 4.0 education of a connected generation, the thinking of computer education is relevant to the construction of youth and adult education. When we include people with ADD, this challenge is not trivial. This work presents a case study carried out with a high school student who has ADD and the techniques that were used to teach him to program to maintain his interest in the area. The method used was divided into three stages: Computer Discovery (1); Introduction to computational thinking through programming (2); Learn by Doing, in line with real-world problem solving using pair programming technique and challenge-based learning strategy (3). In order to investigate the effectiveness of the developed strategies, an experimental case study was carried out with a student who has ADD. The student was introduced to the content and approaches for 34 weeks, totaling 204 hours. The student presented a strong indication of learning and will forever have the ability of computational thinking to program and develop their applications.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is considered an important skill set for 21st-century learners and became a subject of focus in K-12 education in recent years. It cultivates problem-solving and algorithmic thinking and can be helpful in wider aspects of everyday life, besides programming and computer science. In this paper, we investigated what is the Greek Primary and Secondary School Teachers’ understanding and awareness as far as Computational Thinking is concerned. Since teachers are the agents of change, it is critical to find out how familiar and/or skilled they are with the Computational Thinking notion. Thus, we applied a qualitative questionnaire all over the whole Greek State where 406 teachers answered. The study led to a number of interesting conclusions regarding the teacher’s readiness, as well as more generic aspects according to their profile and faculty.},

  abstract={The educational challenges of society permeated by digital technologies are aimed at developing skills to identify and solve environment problems. In this context, computational thinking (CT) emerges as a set of skills to be developed from an early age, which requires the empowerment of programming and demands the use of technological tools. The purpose of this article is to present the design and implementation process of a computer tool for CT evaluation, as well as its validation with a sample of elementary school students from a public institution in Colombia. The methodology focuses on the phases of the SCRUM development process. The results show that women perceive less difficulty in understanding the activities to be solved. It is possible to obtain a web application type software taking into account the evaluated characteristics of the tools used for CT teaching, covering most of these, and with special emphasis on some such as the content in Spanish, instructional model, management of the course, learning activities, monitoring, feedback and gamification.},

  year={2024},
  volume={67},

  pages={282-291},
  abstract={Contribution: A problem-solving approach (PSA) model derived from major computational thinking (CT) concepts. This model can be utilized to formulate solutions for different algorithmic problems and translate them into effective active learning methods. Background: Different teaching approaches for programming are widely available; however, being able to formulate an algorithmic solution computationally and then transform it into code is essential for students. Research Questions: What are the effective teaching approaches for fostering the development of problem-solving and programming skills? How do CT concepts contribute to the formulation of a PSA model for programming problems and its translation into an effective teaching method? How can an effective teaching method that utilizes the PSA model be identified and distinguished from other approaches? Methodology: A preliminary study pointed out the difficulties experienced when teaching programming, inspiring the formulation of a PSA model that used CT concepts. An experimental study on problem-based and game-based programming workshops that utilized the PSA model through sorting algorithms was performed on experimental groups consisting of 30 students each. A syntax-based programming workshop consisting of 30 students was used as the control group. All the participants were recruited through a pretest that incorporated basic programming questions. The participants had to answer a posttest after the workshop. Findings: The results showed that the participants exhibited no significant difference between the pretest and posttest for the syntax-based learning (SBL). However, there is a significant difference between the pretest and posttest of both the problem-based learning (PBL) and the game-based learning (GBL) workshops. There was no significant difference significant difference for the pretest scores of all three workshops. The analysis of the posttest further confirmed that the experimental groups (PBL and GBL) exhibited significant difference in the scores compared to the control group. However, the posttest results did not differ significantly between the experimental groups (PBL and GBL).},

To do this, two concepts are explored. The first, ‘serendipity engineering for seductive hypermedia,’ looks at how to design information systems to account for the pleasant occurrences that happen in offline environments studied by those in sales and marketing where beneficial outcomes often occur by chance encounters. The second, ‘user analysis using socialnomics’ looks at how a parametric user model based on the ecological framework can be used to understand users of information systems from the point of view of supporting a digital economy of users. A number of additional equations are developed using socialnomics that can be applied to digital transformation based on the parametric user model, including to calculate probability of seduction and probability of serendipity in an information system. The parametric model presented has great applicability for information and communications technology solution providers.},

  volume={68},
  number={1},
  pages={20-32},
  abstract={Contribution: We present a framework for teachers to investigate the relationships between attributes of students’ solutions in the process of problem solving or computational thinking. We provide visualization and evaluation techniques to find hidden patterns in the students’ solutions which allow teachers to predict the specific behavior of students or to prevent some student mistakes or misconceptions in advance or further pedagogical intervention. Background: Formal concept analysis is a method of unsupervised Machine Learning that applies mathematical lattice theory to organize data based on objects and their shared attributes. Several fuzzy extensions of formal concept analysis have a great potential to visualize and evaluate students’ solutions, to categorize the solutions into overlapping biclusters (formal concepts) or to generate the attribute implications between extracted attributes. Research Question: Does formal concept analysis describe the various solutions and the relationships between the extracted attributes of students’ solutions in the educational and computational thinking game Light-Bot? Methodology: Targeting the evaluation of 64 students’ solutions in the Light-Bot game, we construct the formal contexts of the extracted attributes. We apply formal concept analysis to construct the concept lattices from two binary formal contexts and to generate attribute implications and their fuzzy counterparts to find the dependencies between the extracted attributes. Findings: The results of our paper provide a description of various students’ solutions which are visualized in the concept lattices. 1) Regarding the concept lattice of binary formal contexts, we obtained the characterization of the largest biclusters which includes a description of the largest group of similar solutions. 2) The attribute implications mainly reveal the characterization of similar solutions, e.g., with a higher count of executed commands in solutions. 3) Using fuzzy attribute implications, we obtained the characterization of solutions with unnecessary commands, going out of the game area, or using indirect recursion.},

  abstract={Computational thinking ability is important in computer science education. It emphasizes abstraction and automation. For automation, programming has become a key ability in digital society recently. As a result, the increase in the importance of coding education in many countries has brought various educational methods to improve teenagers' programming abilities. Among programming abilities, reading ability is important especially to programming novices. This paper focuses on the effects of gender and abstract thinking abilities of adolescents on understanding computer programs. Also, we examine if there is any difference in teaching between adolescents and college students. In order to achieve our research goals, we surveyed on the abstract thinking level, and then measured program understanding ability for 300 academic high school students who had learned C language. From this research, we found that the abstract thinking affects more complex program understanding positively. Also, we found that the language experience before learning brought the difference in program understanding. However, we could not find statistical differences in program understanding between two genders. From this research, we can provide a new point of view to improve adolescents' programming ability with abstract thinking and gender factors.},

In the present study we analyzed clickstream data from 3,355 participants enrolled in several Computational Thinking workshops using Kodetu, an online platform with fine grained logging features. Participants used Kodetu's coding blocks to solve challenges of increasing difficulty while we gathered their clickstream in the platform. Here, we present our findings after evaluating these data in regards of participants' characteristics (age, sex, previous knowledge), similarity with previously submitted solutions, and degree of discrepancy from the optimal solution. To facilitate collaboration with other researchers in this area, we released our dataset under an open license. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest Computational Thinking-related datasets publicly available.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is an essential skill that allows humans to solve a complex problem that later on can be understood by computers and humans. Abstraction and automation are the core of computational thinking. Therefore, CT is the key skill in Industry 4.0. However, in Malaysia's manufacturing, only 50 percent of SMEs deploy automation. Automation can make the company more efficient, more accurate and decrease human error. CT was built based on 4 basic pillars which are abstraction, decomposition, algorithm and pattern recognition. These pillars will encourage automation, efficiency, and innovation. Moreover, one of the benefits of CT for nonprogrammer is the formulated problem can be passed on to information-processing agents such as third-party companies or freelancers who can create the solution. In this paper, we review the benefits of computational thinking in entrepreneurship in the context of Industry 4.0.},

  abstract={Computational thinking, or the problem-solving process driven by Computer Science concepts, has been acclaimed as a basic skill of the 21st century. In this context, several researches have been developed to insert computational thinking in schools. The objective of this work is to investigate the use of tools to support the teaching-learning of computational thinking in the national scenario. For this, a systematic mapping of the literature was carried out, using articles published in events and periodical of national relevance. For the analysis, 21 papers published between 2014 and 2017 were selected. The results of this mapping are: (a) the identification of the tools used; (b) what resources are required for the development of such tools, and (c) what benefits students have been reported in using the tools.},

  abstract={The Raspberry Pi platform provides true equal opportunity-of-use in computing globally. From it, new affordable research and industrial opportunities have emerged. To fully realise its driving potential, particularly in developing countries, a persistent knowledge teaching process for the Raspberry Pi is necessary. This paper presents a quasi-flipped learning model (QFLM) intended to spark critical and creative thinking and foster an entrepreneurial spirit early in a student's tertiary education life-cycle. The model was applied as part of a computer science component for third year students in the Electrical & Information Engineering (E.I.E) Department of the University of Nairobi. Student programming confidence and completion of a time-bound project were used as model assessment metrics. It was found that the Raspberry Pi, coupled with the learning model, is a viable catalyst for local innovation and entrepreneurial opportunities.},

  abstract={The optimal paradigm and systematic solution to scheduling and decision-making for container terminal logistics systems (CTLS) have been scarce owing to their high nolinear and complexity and the strong coupling and randomness. In this paper, the concept of computational logistics for CTLS is proposed above all, and then the instruction sets, resource constraints, and operating environments for CTLS abstract machines are defined on the basis of the similarities and differences between computer systems and CTLS. Subsequently, CTLS are discussed from the perspective of asymmetric single-ISA multi-core processors (AMP) in detail within the conceptual framework of computational logistics and generalized computing. Consequently, a container terminal computational logistics model is presented with computing architecture and central properties of AMP. Finally, the proposed approach is demonstrated and validated by investigating through capacity, task latency and load balancing of a typical container terminal logistics service case with a comprehensive scheduling algorithm that is a composite of multifarious classical decision thinking and algorithms.},

In this article, we show how to use the Regulated Activation Network (RAN) cognitive model to reconstruct abstract concepts and their blends. The MNIST dataset is used in this work to build a representation of abstract concepts. For the demonstration, three experiments were designed: first, shows how a high dimensional input image is encoded into a low dimension vector and further reconstructed back into an image; second, reconstruction of blends of abstract concepts that represent same digits; third, reconstructing blends of abstract concepts which represent different digits. The reconstructed images in all three experiments were visually analyzed. The best reconstructions were observed with the encoded image experiment obtaining Mean Squared Error of 0.00562 and an Rsquare score of 0.9193. The blends of similar abstract concepts also reconstructed the expected blend of a digit. The blends of dissimilar abstract concepts reconstructed the images by creating interesting symbols such as character x.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This innovative practice paper describes a work in progress on creating and applying educational games that develop mathematical and computational thinking within the project Science&Math educational games from preschool to university - SciMaG. Using educational games, especially in STEM fields, is an effective way to engage students and promote key skills across different age groups and environments. Such activities promote problem solving, logical thinking, strategic planning, and other important skills and can be used with students of different age groups in the classroom, in extracurricular activities, or at home. STEM science outreach activities organized as part of science festivals and similar events can be an excellent opportunity for a game-based approach. However, organizing events for large numbers of participants can pose a logistical challenge in terms of volunteer availability. This paper presents the results of a study in which game-based activities to develop mathematical and computational thinking were integrated into a science outreach event for primary school students on the occasion of Pi-Day. The innovative aspect of the approach is reflected in the use of a combination of games (commercial, newly developed games, and games inspired by commercial ones) which have an interesting math basis and require mathematical or computational thinking skills as well as in the introduction of peer teaching through attracting high-school students as volunteers for the organized event. In the evaluation of the approach, the perceptions of the primary school students (Ns=295), their teachers (NT=19), and the high-school students participating as volunteers in the organized event (Nv=11) were examined using a questionnaire-based study. All groups of participants responded positively and confirmed educational potential of the games. Results confirmed that the activities were well-received and that such events have the potential to enhance learning experiences in STEM. The results also provide valuable insights and motivation for further development of educational games within the SciMaG project.},

  abstract={The planning and scheduling of container terminal logistics systems (CTLS) are the multi-objective and multiple strong constraints combinatorial optimization challenges under the uncertain environments, and those are provided with high goal orientation, dynamics, context-sensitivity, coupling, timeliness, and complexity. The increasingly sophisticated decision-making for CTLS is one of the most pressing problems for the programming and optimization method available. This paper discusses CTLS in terms of logistics generalized computation complexity based on computational thinking, great principles of computing, and computational lens, which three are abbreviated with 3CTGPL, and makes a definition of container terminal oriented logistics generalized computational complexity (CTO-LGCC) and container terminal logistics generalized computation comprehensive performance perspective (CTL-GCCPP) from the dimensions of time, space, communication, processor, and memory access. Both can analyze, generalize, migrate, translate, localize, modificate, and evaluate the above-complicated problems and lay solid foundations and establish a feedback improvement framework for the computational model and scheduling algorithms of the CTLS, which is an essential complement to the modeling and optimization methodology and solutions to CTLS with computational logistics. Finally, aimed at the logistics service cases for a large-scale container terminal, the simulation is designed and implemented for different scheduling algorithms, and the qualitative and quantitative comprehensive analysis is executed for the concomitant CTO-LGCC that demonstrates and verifies the feasibility and credibility of the CTO-LGCC and CTL-GCCPP from the viewpoint of the practice of container terminal decision-making support on the tactical level.},

  abstract={Computers cause an impact in almost every single aspect of our lives, however, unfortunately, schools have not been able to keep up with this irreversible evolution. The simple use of technological apparatuses in the classroom does not guarantee the improvement of the learning process, however it can be the medium through which the students find the alternatives for the solution of complex problems. The Computational Thinking is an approach of teaching that uses a diverse range of techniques derived from computers for the resolution of these problems combined with the new competencies of the 21st century (critical thinking, collaboration, etc.). The adoption of the notion of Computing within the basic education schools is a concern in many countries, where the implementation occurs in a strict way. Admittedly, it grows the idea that the Computing discipline is very distinct from the computer classes and that the use of skills from Computing possesses educational (reflection and problem solving, the comprehension that the world is ingrained with the digital technology) and economic (high demand of professionals with good training) benefits. This article, through the vast bibliographic review, describes an international landscape of countries of all Americas, in order to contextualize the reader in respect to the adoption of Computational Thinking within the basic education schools.},

  abstract={Summary form only given. Recent basic studies reveal that AI problems are deeply rooted in both the understanding of the natural intelligence and the adoption of suitable mathematical means for rigorously modeling the brain in machine understandable forms. Learning is a cognitive process of knowledge and behavior acquisition. Learning can be classified into five categories known as object identification, cluster classification, functional regression, behavior generation, and knowledge acquisition. A fundamental challenge to knowledge learning different from the deep and recurring neural network technologies has led to the emergence of the field of cognitive machine learning on the basis of recent breakthroughs in denotational mathematics and mathematical engineering. This keynote lecture presents latest advances in formal brain studies and cognitive systems for deep reasoning and deep learning. It is recognized that key technologies enabling cognitive robots mimicking the brain rely not only on deep learning, but also on deep reasoning and thinking towards machinable thoughts and cognitive knowledge bases built by a cognitive systems. A fundamental theory and novel technology for implementing deep thinking robots are demonstrated based on concept algebra, semantics algebra, and inference algebra.},

  abstract={Distinguishing between literal and metaphorical language is a major challenge facing natural language processing. Heuristically, metaphors can be divided into three general types in which type III metaphors are those involving an adjective-noun relationship (e.g. “dark humor”). This paper describes our approach for automatic identification of type III metaphors. We propose a new algorithm, the Concrete-Category Overlap (CCO) algorithm, that distinguishes between literal and metaphorical use of adjective-noun relationships and evaluate it on two data sets of adjective-noun phrases. Our results point to the superiority of the CCO algorithm to past and contemporary approaches in determining the presence and conceptual significance of metaphors, and provide a better understanding of the conditions under which each algorithm should be applied.},

  abstract={The rapid, global spread of COVID-19 has led to an unprecedented rise in enrollments in online learning experiences among learners of all ages. In this article, we explore the impact of the global pandemic on a massive open online course, Problem Solving Using Computational Thinking, with a particular focus on the topics learners chose for their final projects. The Computational Thinking MOOC was designed using a project-based learning approach and aims to provide learners with an introduction to the “big ideas” of computational thinking using a range of case studies that encompass topics such as airport surveillance, epidemiology, and human trafficking. Beyond observing a sharp increase in enrollment and engagement at the time the pandemic began, we discuss ways in which the course's project-based pedagogy allowed learners to bring their present experiences and concerns together with the course's subject matter in order to meet the learning objectives for the course. Many learners chose to address aspects of the pandemic in the course's final project and applied ideas about computational thinking to peer-graded assignments that conveyed an individualized sense of importance and urgency. We assert that this approach, along with the inclusion of a timely epidemiology case study, enabled learners to more deeply internalize the role that computational thinking can play in their own lives and in society as a whole.},

  abstract={This study discusses a NSF-funded Research Practice Partnership (RPP) to develop and pilot instructional materials for teaching computational thinking to Grades 3-5 students, with a focus on language learners. The study takes place in a U.S. school district whose percentages of Latino/a students, language learners, and low-income students are among the highest in the nation. The project is among the first to examine the linguistic and sociocultural factors that facilitate the success of multilingual students in mastering computational thinking. Utilizing principles of Design-Based Implementation Research in alignment with the RPP approach, researchers worked collaboratively with teachers and administrators to identify problems of practice in computer science education specific to the district. A broad survey of national and regional computer science initiatives was conducted to identify effective approaches for teaching computational thinking to diverse learners. As a result of this survey, the RPP identified a pathbreaking curriculum that aligns with the Computer Science Teachers Association K-12 standards to pilot in five classrooms in the first year of the RPP. The curriculum was further revised to align with the Common Core State Standards for English Language Arts and the California English Language Development standards during a week-long summer institute. This paper describes these experiences, highlighting the integration of computational thinking into an English Language Arts curriculum as well as the linguistic scaffolding strategies utilized to better meet the needs of multilingual students. This experience report uncovers pedagogical practices of computational thinking for diverse students and identifies areas for future work.},

  abstract={Nowadays, the analysis of the relationship between students' ICT literacy and CT skills remains unclear, and less attention is paid to the influence of ICT resources at school on CT skills. To fill these gaps, a survey was performed on 1056 participants between the ages of 11 and 14, attending a secondary school in China. The participants completed one self-reported questionnaire about CT skills, ICT literacy, and ICT resources at school. The study revealed gender differences in CT skills based on the independent samples t-test, with boys having higher CT skills than girls. Additionally, the study found that ICT literacy mediates the relationship between ICT resources at school and CT skills. The research findings provide important insights for improving students' CT skills. Educators should pay attention to the gender differences in CT skills of male and female students and improve the acquired CT skills of female students. In addition, the improvement of students' ICT literacy skills and the improvement of ICT resources at school can also have a positive effect on students' CT skills.},

  abstract={This Research Full Paper addresses the definition and implementation of Computational Thinking (CT) in K-12 education. CT is the focus of ongoing debate about the future of computing in schools, and this poses a number of challenges. Early discussions on the topic were plagued by vague and all-encompassing definitions of the term, which raised awareness of a need for school learning focused on emerging computational systems and their impact on society and the lives of citizens, but failed to address what should actually be included in the revised curricula. As some of those issues have been addressed, a number of problems remain. This paper analyses some recent and future developments in the field of computing, and expands the discussion on the vexed question of the nature and limits of computational thinking. We ask whether the current mainstream literature and curriculum for CT is well positioned in terms of the future towards which computing is heading. We conclude by summarising the implications these questions have for the future development of K-12 curricula and teaching practices.},

  abstract={Computational thinking, a problem solving method that uses computer science techniques, has recently become mainstream as many governments and major Internet companies are promoting programming skills among children. However, little is known about how programming affects other aspects of life beyond the acquired programming skills. In this regard, this paper summarizes the work done in the school San Diego and San Vicente (Madrid, Spain) during the third quarter of the year 2013/2014, where we conducted a study with four groups of students in 4th and 5th grade to measure to what extent the use of computer programming in English classes can be an interesting educational tool with a positive impact on the learning otucome of the students. The results show that the groups working with programming activities improved more than the groups using traditional resources. Moreover, when asked via surveys at the end of the study, most students felt that coding was a positive influence, not only for learning English, but for developing other important skills as teamwork and learning to learn.},

  year={2019},

  abstract={Effective application of contextual learning can be facilitated by providing opportunity to students to use the knowledge in concept learnt, to solve certain problems within a `context'. To improve student engagement in quantitative based course like Math, Accounting or Science; it is of supreme importance that students are able to make connections between knowledge and its application to a real world context. Two such cases of Contextual Learning have been presented in this paper which was modeled in implementation of interdisciplinary projects across Accounting and IT disciplines, with Business students enrolled in Managerial Accounting and Cost Accounting courses and CIS students in Mobile Application course and ICT. This study aims at presenting a contextual strategy used to enhance Accounting and IT skills in Undergraduate students at Dubai Women's College, Higher Colleges of Technology. We posited that through this contextualized approach, students would see Accounting, Computational thinking and app development as tools for solving work-related problems. Using Constructivist teaching and REACT (relating, experience, application, collaboration and transfer) strategy; we initiated curriculum integration of both Accounting and IT, which deviates from traditional teaching model where learning of a subjects is isolated from any context. We conclude that the interdisciplinary projects implemented were a robust technique for application of contextual learning. The most important outcome was achieving the highest level in bloom's taxonomy and that is to `create'.},

These are factors that limit the teaching of computing in the education of children. As a solution to this problem, the project called “SCRATCHTON” is created, which looks forward to bringing technology to children in an efficiently and easy way. This consists in a programming contest where kids develop a game based on a given theme, where participants need to complete the challenge with the help of Scratch tools that were previously taught through video tutorials. With this, the goal is to encourage children to have better analytical skills, to awake computational thinking, and to increase interest in programming through incentives and recognition.},

  abstract={In design, good ideas are the source of a designer’s creativity. With the development of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) represented by ChatGPT shows excellent conversational and creative reasoning capabilities. However, we still know very little about the design ideation process and its performance in terms of productivity. In this paper, we propose a representation of the design ideation process based on NLP. On this basis, referring to LASSO and linkography method, we propose a DCLASSO model to calculate the interconnections between design moves in protocol analysis. In the subsequent experiment, we take the design protocols generated by ChatGPT as the experimental sample to verify the proposed model. Finally, with the generated linkographs, the characteristics of ChatGPT and human designers are analyzed and compared from aspects of design ideation process and design productivity.},

One of the primary challenges is data that is being generated in huge quantity at enormous pace and in variety of forms. Social medium has blow up as a sort of online discussion where people create and share the information at a substantial rate. The outlook of social media user is now noticeably used for taking the decisions. Evaluating sentiments, opinions and emotions by a group of people in the form of reviews pertaining to a certain event can carve out the niche of providing insights into the review text analytics, especially when text data is large. On one hand sentiments shows the conformity, disparity or objectivity among the masses whereas on the other hand emotions coming out from text clusters the group feedback. In this paper, the authors analyses the sentiments of patients pertaining to ayurvedic spa treatment. User reviews from the top rated websites are extracted to obtain the sentiments. The authors explore the possible ways to analysis the user sentiments using NLTK and Python programming libraries.},

  abstract={This poster proposal for the 2019 RESPECT Conference reports on the ongoing progress of the NSF-funded computer science pathways project entitled “Developing Inclusive K-12 Computing Pathways for the League of Innovative Schools” (award #1837386). Entitled “CT Pathways” for short, the three-year research practitioner partnership (RPP) is a collaboration between Digital Promise Global, Digital Promise, and the League of Innovative Schools, a national network of 101 school districts across 33 states, serving over 3 million students. The goal of CT Pathways is to design, investigate and improve inclusive computing pathways for all K-12 students, starting in elementary school and going through high school. In this RPP, researchers join with three “Core” districts and twelve “Pilot” districts from the League of Innovative Schools to focus on districts’ Hispanic and African American students, Title 1 schools and, more generally, their girls and low-income students. The poster presentation will focus on the first of CT Pathways’ three research questions: How do individual participating League districts define the purpose (“the why”) of CS and CT education, and how do these individual rationales subsequently inform respective district’s intention to offer their students more equitable access to CS/CT content (“the how”)? Results will be reported via baseline pre-survey results from district administrators as well as through follow-up interviews/discussions with select district leads. At this early stage, the primary goal is to help districts align the economic and digital literacy rationales for CS/CT education with the wider social justice and broadening participation considerations they have identified.},

  pages={110-113},
  abstract={Machine learning is a key technology to design and develop products, systems, and even services. In particular, image classification using deep learning has been successfully applied to many fields. Although industrial designers might learn this is an opportunity for their best practice, studies demonstrating how to integrate the technology into the design process are rare. Thus, we discussed the need to introduce ML to industrial design by presenting examples and ML tools with lower scientific thresholds such as Weka that is preferable for industrial design students and practitioners. A five-stage process of applying ML to product form-giving is presented to illustrate the bridging of ML to the design process. Further technical details and industry case studies are needed to demonstrate evidence of the advantages of ML in form-giving. The implication is not only in sharpening the tools of product form-giving but also in rethinking the theories of industrial design.},

  abstract={This paper presents measure-valued Markov decision processes (MVMDPs) and gives an algorithm of finding an optimal policy for this model. MVMDP is a generalization of partially observable Markov decision process, and reflects an important characteristic of human thought: that people, under the possibility that they grasp the whole states (i.e., appropriately measure the state space), think of problems and can choose their own optimal actions. So the measure-valued Markov decision process is the conscious result of unconscious decision minds. Moreover, we extend this thought to the category of divergent thinking and presents measure-valued Markov process model which is based on the measure-valued branching process in modern probability theory. This model can depict the unconscious mind feature that is: the way of human thinking is not linear, like logical mind; on the contrary, the mind has a grasp of the whole problem and evolves in an “area” manner; in this way, the mind can always get the heart of problems. We believe this work is helpful for further development of artificial intelligence.},

  abstract={This paper summarizes the successes and challenges encountered during the incorporation of the New Mexico State University DISSECT (DIScovering SciEnce through Computational Thinking) Fellowship program into a 6th grade classroom. Graduate student fellows work with experienced K-12 teachers to create and deploy interactive computational thinking (CT) modules in middle and high school classrooms that promote active learning through the use of technology and cutting edge scientific research. One of the main objectives of the DISSECT program is to facilitate the professional development of graduate students in computing-rich fields, such as engineering, computer science, and biology, through leadership development, public speaking experience, and an enhanced vision of how CT is vital to in all scientific disciplines. The alliances formed between K-12 teachers and their fellows provide an opportunity for teachers to attain knowledge of CT principles and equips them with the ability to develop and continue their own future lesson plans integrating CT. This paper thoroughly describes specific modules that integrate CT concepts into the traditional 6th grade science curriculum, the statistical results of assessments gauging the development of CT skills and knowledge during the course of one academic year, and suggestions for improvements and incorporation into other curricula.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) has been identified in the last few years as a fundamental skill that should be developed by all people. This has motivated multiple initiatives, whether governmental, through organizations, or by individuals. However, upon realizing a literature review, to the best of our knowledge no initiatives that include minority groups such as those within the Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were proposed. Furthermore, in this context there are no guidelines to orientate the creation of didactic activities that will bring about the benefits of CT. Due to the aforementioned information, in this article we present the definition of a collection of guidelines for the construction of didactic activities (CT4AII) that aim to promote Computational Thinking in adolescents with ASD through the construction of digital games. The proposed guidelines were instantiated in a Digital Games Programming Workshop with Scratch. The workshop was offered to four adolescents with ASD, obtaining the development of high-level CT skills and stimulating interpersonal skills that are diminished in this public. Furthermore, a posttest was executed 5 months later, with the objective of determining if the developed skills had been maintained over time. The results evidenced that the skills were in fact maintained in a sustained manner, demonstrating promising results.},

  abstract={This research to practice, work in progress paper presents the analysis strategy used to assess the learning behavior using logs on an e-learning platform. Students who can link algebraic functions to their corresponding graphs perform well in STEM courses. Early algebra curricula teaches these concepts in tandem. However, it is challenging to assess whether students are linking the concepts. Video analyses, interviews and other traditional methods that aim to quantify how students link the concepts taught in school require precious classroom and teacher time. We use web logs to infer learning. Web logs are widely available and amenable to data science. Our approach partitions the web interface into components related to data and graph concepts. We collect click and mouse movement data as users interact with these components. We used statistical and data mining techniques to model their learning behavior. We built our models to assess learning behavior for a workshop presented in Summer 2016. Students in the workshop were middle-school math teachers planning to use this curriculum in their own classrooms. We used our models to assess participation levels, a prerequisite indicator for learning. Our models aligned with ground-truth traditional methods for 17 of 18 students. The results of the models with respect to the two types of components of the web portal have been used to infer possible data or graph oriented cognitive bias.},

  abstract={Whereas the imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) shows limited global search ability and be liable to be trapped into local optimum, a double-assimilation of prosperity and destruction oriented improved imperialist competitive algorithm (DPDO-IIC A) is proposed tentatively to overcome inherent defects. The imperialist assimilation and colonial reform strategy are customized purposefully, and a novel population redistribution mechanism is introduced as well. The three improvement measures are supposed to further promote population diversity and searching accuracy. The CEC2017 test set is selected to verify the performance of the DPDO-IICA by the different types of numerical function problems with the different dimensions. Moreover, the DPDO-IICA is compared with the three first-class intelligent optimization algorithms, which have achieved significant rankings in the CEC2017 competition. The comparison shows that the DPDO-IICA has good performances, which is demonstrated by the accuracy and stability. In addition, the proportion of imperialists and colonies is investigated, and it is through the community partitioning and clustering dynamically to enhance the population diversity. In conclusion, the DPDO-IICA can effectively improve the ability of global exploration and avoid premature convergence in comparison with the original ICA.},

  abstract={Among diagrammatic representations, law encoding diagrams (LEDs) are a special class. A LED captures the important laws or relations of a domain in the structure of a diagram using geometrical, spatial and topological constraints, such that a single instantiation of a diagram represents one instance of a phenomenon. Research on LEDs uses a combination of approaches, including the analysis of properties, computational modelling and empirical studies. The overarching theoretical context of this work is the paradigm of complex information processing, which sees problem solving as symbol processing by the means of heuristic searching. This paper considers how different LEDs can be used to solve diverse problems, and contrasts them to common Cartesian graphs, to argue that LEDs may be useful representations for expert problem solving. LEDs seem to be able to support some of the abilities that experts appear to possess, such as: being able to perceive large meaningful patterns; solving problems fast and with little error; seeing problems at a deep level; and doing large amounts of qualitative analysis of problems. Various forms of problem solving are examined in a particular domain, using different LEDs and conventional graphs. One LED and some sample problems are described. The domain is that of collisions among bodies moving in a straight line, with no frictional resistance.},

  abstract={Existing scheduling and decision solutions to container terminal logistics systems (CTLS) are falling short of peoples' wishes both in theory and in practice. This paper proposes a container terminal gang scheduling computational paradigm (GSCP) for planning and control at container terminals based on computational thinking. GSCP is built on the computing perspective and architecture of multi-processor system-on-chip. GSCP applies principles of pervasive computing to evaluate load conditions of core resources, and then integrates the fundamental principles of gang scheduling, processor affinity and load balancing to define the flexible and robust decision framework and scheduling algorithm set. Those are intended to improve the performance of CTLS, and strive for balance among through capacity for vessels and containers, task latency and load leveling as well. GSCP is demonstrated and validated by a typical container hub logistics service case with intensive computational experiments.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) has become an indispensable skill in the 21st century and has permeated into K-12 education at all levels. The evaluation of CT has become a crucial concern for educators and researchers. Currently., while extensive research has investigated the assessment of students' CT conceptual understanding., the measurement of their thinking processes is less involved. The game-based assessment appears to address this issue by analyzing students' behaviors and reactions during the gameplay process., which has become an emerging assessment tool in CT education. This drives the need for a comprehensive overview of this field. To fill this gap., this study aims to conduct a systematic literature review on the assessment of CT through games. It explores CT skills assessed through games., focusing on target groups, game forms., and benefits. A total of fifteen studies were examined. Findings indicate that algorithmic thinking, problem decomposition, pattern recognition., and abstraction were commonly assessed in games. Different ways for assessing CT skills in games were identified, involving progression level, log data, and manual coding. The benefits of CT game-based assessments were broadly reported, such as enjoyable experiences for students, instant feedback, easy administration for teachers and researchers, and richer information on students' cognitive processes. However, limited has been done in exploring the use of digital games for younger age groups, and the psychometric qualities of the tools were hardly reported in the reviewed studies. The study sheds light on the research and teaching practices in using games and interactive assessment platforms in CT education.},

  abstract={The popularization of digital educational devices with low barriers to entry has encouraged the development of many training activities oriented towards the incorporation of technology in schools. In some cases, the introduction of technology has led to the development of new educational practices that support the development of computational thinking. However, the supposed benefits of these approaches have not been properly assessed. Moreover, having taught over 30 workshops with the Scratch programming tool to teachers at different educational levels (primary, secondary, university), we found no evidence of subsequent methodological changes in schools. This study tries to understand the dissonance between the alleged success of initiatives around digital literacy and the lack of continuity in the use of user-friendly programming environments like Scratch. For this purpose, we analyzed the evolution of the grades of Scratch programming achieved by the students of the School of Education of Vitoria-Gasteiz and their engagement with Scratch. We also interviewed teachers from different schools who have participated in Scratch workshops with us. After this study, we identified some of the circumstances that facilitate and hinder the development of computational thinking. Since we consider Scratch as a resource that allows the development of new methodological approaches in the classroom as well as the acquisition of skills related to computational thinking, we propose a framework that will help to overcome the current status.},

  title={Unified Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology Against Unplugged Computational Thinking Activities}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},

  pages={357-362},
  abstract={Occasionally, there may be a low impact on learning engagement between teachers and students due to, for example, poor internet connection or simply because students have lost their focus. One of the methods to improve learning engagement is through a research framework called Unified Theory Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). This paper adopted 17 UTAUT questions to compare with research variables (pre-post surveys and genders). The user acceptance and use of technology or UTAUT consisted of Likert scale (Strongly disagree to Strongly Agree) questions, computed to generate total scores for each participant. Then, the scores will be compared to each variable to investigate the relationships between these variables against the UTAUT. This study could be implemented via online learning, but in the end, the offline (unplugged) method was the only method to deliver the learning activities. There is limited evidence discussing UTAUT within the area of offline learning; hence, this paper will focus on another spectrum regarding the UTAUT study. Instead of mobile (online) learning engagement, this paper studies the relationship between unplugged learning with user acceptance and the use of technology. Spearman correlation indicated that the unplugged learning approach has a significant positive relationship with user acceptance and use of technology. It revealed that students may also demonstrate an interest in online learning engagement and be able to comprehensively accept the online learning approach. In contrast, Mann-Whitney U test analysis on genders revealed no significant difference. The findings could contribute to another noteworthy discussion regarding the validity of user acceptance and the use of technology against the unplugged learning approach.},

  volume={},

  pages={1-4},
  abstract={This work-in-progress paper is part of a project that aims to analyze how the implementation of different instructional designs through complete and incomplete examples influence the cognitive load that students perceive when learning statistics and computer programming. For this first stage, we conducted a pilot study aimed at conducting a differentiated measurement of cognitive loads through secondary tasks and a subjective scale. The pilot study consisted of three moments. The first one focused on measuring their working memory capacity and their prior knowledge of statistics. Then, students worked on a learning activity focused on using Chi-square and Pearson correlation to conduct inferential analyses. The study included two different instructional designs in the form of computational notebooks. Design 1 consisted of correct and incomplete examples, while Design 2 included correct, incomplete, and incorrect examples. Simultaneously, students had to attend to a secondary task, which consisted of responding to an auditory stimulus, after which they had to press a key on their keyboard. Finally, students completed a naïve rating scale of cognitive loads involved in the task. The results highlight the important role of prior knowledge in different instructional designs and how it connects to students' perceived cognitive effort. Likewise, the differences in the instructional designs influenced students' cognitive loads, suggesting a differentiated measure of extraneous loads. Using incorrect examples in learning statistics and programming may affect students' perceived difficulty without resulting in a better learning outcome.},

The computational thinking and conceptualization of sustainability were incorporated. The interaction between instruction treatment and participants' personality was investigated. Eighty-six engineering undergraduates participated in this experimental study for exploring the effectiveness of the IMSP program. The findings indicate that 1) the IMSP program promoted undergraduates' computational thinking, and further enhanced their design innovation ability; 2) the program that integrated the conceptualization of sustainability has better teaching effects than that without the conceptual integration; 3) the personal characters of innovation proaction and emotional intelligence acted as moderators in the ISMP program.
