abstract = {The geometric effects of Coanda trailing edges on the aerodynamic performance of an airfoil are numerically evaluated for a range of different freestream Mach numbers and momentum coefficients. A Circulation control (CC) airfoil with a circular trailing edge (ACTE) proves to have better control effectiveness at low subsonic freestream speeds (Mach = 0.1). A CC airfoil having an elliptic trailing edge (AETE) outperforms the ACTE at high subsonic flow conditions. The occurrence of Cμ-stall for the AETE is greatly postponed, and meanwhile the maximum net lift coefficient increment achieved for the AETE (ΔCL = 0.51) is slightly higher than that of the ACTE (ΔCL = 0.50) at Mach 0.6. Compared to the ACTE, the AETE is found to have better control consistency at different operating velocities and better control stability when the Coanda jet is supersonic. Through careful consideration of the aerodynamic performance and the control effects, the most appropriate axial ratio for an AETE ellipse is within the interval from 1.5 to 2. Finally, the flow field instability phenomenon and the jet detachment induced by the supersonic Coanda jet are investigated. A self-sustained shock-wave instability phenomenon without jet detachment is first observed in this paper.}

abstract = {Background: A recent COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a large death toll rate globally and even no cure or vaccine has been successfully employed to combat this disease. Patients have been reported with multi-organ dysfunction along with acute respiratory distress syndrome which implies a critical situation for patients and made them difficult to breathe and survive. Moreover, pathology of COVID-19 is also related to cytokine storm which indicates the elevated levels of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-12, and IL-18 along with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α. Among them, the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 has been reported to be induced via binding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS)-CoV-2 to the host receptors. Methodology: Interleukin-6 blockade has been proposed to constitute novel therapeutics against COVID-19. Thus, in this study, 15 phytocompounds with known antiviral activity have been subjected to test for their inhibitory effect on IL-6. Based on the affinity prediction, top 3 compounds (isoorientin, lupeol, and andrographolide) with best scores were selected for 50 ns molecular dynamics simulation and MMGB/PBSA binding free energy analysis. Results: Three phytocompounds including isoorientin, lupeol, and andrographolide have shown strong interactions with the targeted protein IL-6 with least binding energies (−7.1 to −7.7 kcal/mol). Drug-likeness and ADMET profiles of prioritized phytocompounds are also very prominsing and can be further tested to be potential IL-6 blockers and thus benficial for COVID-19 treatment. The moelcular dynamics simulation couple with MMGB/PBSA binding free energy estimation validated conformational stability of the ligands and stronger intermolecular binding. The mean RMSD of the complexes is as: IL6-isoorientin complex (3.97 Å ± 0.77), IL6-lupeol (3.97 Å ± 0.76), and IL6-andrographolide complex (3.96 Å ± 0.77). In addition, the stability observation was affirmed by compounds mean RMSD: isoorientin (0.72 Å ± 0.32), lupeol (mean 0.38 Å ± 0.08), and andrographolide (1.09 Å ± 0.49). A similar strong agreement on systems stability was unraveled by MMGB/PBSA that found net binding net ~ −20 kcal/mol for the complexes dominated by van der Waal interaction energy. Conclusion: It has been predicted that proposing potential IL-6 inhibitors with less side effects can help critical COVID-19 patients because it may control the cytokine storm, a major responsible factor of its pathogenesis. In this study, 3 potential phytocompounds have been proposed to have inhibitory effect on IL-6 that can be tested as potential therapeutic options against SARS-CoV-2.}

abstract = {In this paper we report on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of airflow inside the nozzles used in Nozzle-Ring spinning. Using the CFD, air velocities at different locations of the nozzle were obtained and then drag forces acting on hair and yarn were computed. Z-twisted carded cotton yarns were produced at ring spinning machine with and without placing nozzle. Three nozzles were used, each having air inlets at different axial angle. Using the results of simulation, the role of air drag forces and angle of impact of air current on reduction in yarn hairiness could be explained. Nozzle-Ring yarns had a lower number of S3-hairs than the regular ring yarn. The drag forces played a dominant role in reducing the hairs. The angle of air inlets controlled the impact angle of air on the hair. At very high impact angle, curving of protruding hair was bound to occur during its folding, signifying the difficulty in wrapping the hair over the yarn and, hence, a lower reduction in hairiness.}

abstract = {Simulation software used for modeling has become as ubiquitous as computers themselves. Despite growing reliance on simulation in educational and workplace settings, users encounter frustration in using simulation software programs. The authors conducted a study with 26 engineering students and interviewed them about their experience learning the simulation software Arena for optimization modeling. These students experienced frustration with the process of learning to “think” like the simulation software. Students explained their difficulty with learning the software in a way that implied human dialogue with a machine and negotiation with Arena in an attempt to overcome this frustration. Rather than being gender specific, frustrations were experienced by most male and female students equally, specifically those who held a perception of difference between human and machine “thinking.” The authors contend that communication difficulty with the embedded assumptions of the software is the source of frustration rather than deficiencies of users.}

abstract = {Processing rewarding and aversive signals lies at the core of many adaptive behaviors, including value-based decision making. The brain circuits processing these signals are widespread and include the prefrontal cortex, amygdala and striatum, and their dopaminergic innervation. In this review, we integrate historic findings on the behavioral and neural mechanisms of value-based decision making with recent, groundbreaking work in this area. On the basis of this integrated view, we discuss a neuroeconomic framework of value-based decision making, use this to explain the motivation to pursue rewards and how motivation relates to the costs and benefits associated with different courses of action. As such, we consider substance addiction and overeating as states of altered value-based decision making, in which the expectation of reward chronically outweighs the costs associated with substance use and food consumption, respectively. Together, this review aims to provide a concise and accessible overview of important literature on the neural mechanisms of behavioral adaptation to reward and aversion and how these mediate motivated behaviors.}

abstract = {Multistate transition models (MSTMs) are valuable tools depicting disease progression. However, due to the complexity of MSTMs, larger sample size and longer follow-up time in real-world data, the computation of statistical estimation and inference for MSTMs becomes challenging. A bounded Taylor series in Newton–Raphson procedure is proposed which leverages the uniformization technique to derive maximum likelihood estimates and corresponding covariance matrix. The proposed method, namely uniformization Taylor-bounded Newton–Raphson, is validated in three simulation studies, which demonstrate the accuracy in parameter estimation, the efficiency in computation time and robustness in terms of different situations. This method is also illustrated using a large electronic medical record data related to statin-induced side effects and discontinuation.}
