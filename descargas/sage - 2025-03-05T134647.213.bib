abstract = {In this paper, the effect of near gravity material at desired separation density during the coal washing is studied. It is believed that the Dense Medium Separation of coal particles in the presence of high percentage of near gravity material, results in a significant misplacement of coal particles to wrong products. However the performance of dense medium cyclone does not merely depend on the total amount of near gravity materials but also on their distribution as well as on their quality. This paper deals with numerical simulation of magnetite medium segregation and coal partitioning handled in a 350 mm dense medium cyclone. Volume of Fluid coupled with Reynolds Stress Model is used to resolve the two-phase air-core and turbulence. Algebraic Slip mixture multiphase model with the granular options are considered to predict magnetite medium segregation. Medium segregation results are validated against Gamma Ray Tomography measurements. Further, Discrete Phase Model is used to track the coal particles. Residence Time Distribution of different size and density coal particles are also estimated using Discrete Phase Model. Additionally, Algebraic Slip mixture model is also utilised to simulate magnetite and coal particle segregation at different near gravity material proportions. Discrepancies in the coal particle behaviour at different near gravity material content are explained using locus of zero vertical velocities, mixture density, coal volume fractions.}

abstract = {In today’s technology-driven healthcare landscape, AI competencies are essential for medical students. This study assessed AI literacy and online information search (OIS) skills among 336 students from 12 public medical institutions in Sindh, Pakistan. The survey revealed strong AI literacy in areas such as hardware, software, data literacy, content creation, safety, and problem-solving, but students struggled with understanding AI errors. They also demonstrated sufficient behavioral, procedural, and meta-cognitive competencies in online information searching. A significant positive correlation between AI literacy and OIS skills was found, indicating that higher AI literacy improves students’ search abilities. These findings underscore the need to integrate AI-related skills into medical education to better prepare students for the evolving healthcare environment. The study offers insights for AI developers, AI vendors, medical educators, librarians, medical institution administrators, and policymakers on how they can play a significant role in enhancing AI literacy and search competencies in medical education.}

abstract = {The critical research agenda on smart cities has tended to assume a largely top-down orientation in which powerful actors like the state and corporations enact programmes to embed Information & Communication Technologies (ICT) in the urban landscape. Because of the way research has framed this relation of power, the dominant response has been to seek social justice by either contesting these top-down exercises of (digital) power or by reconceptualising the smart city ‘from below’. In this paper, we join a growing chorus of voices recognising the importance of interstitial actors that influence the ways in which the smart city manifests. We draw on a five-year ongoing study in Calgary, Alberta, to examine two actor groups that are, properly, neither top-down nor bottom-up, but play an important role in envisioning, implementing and contesting how ‘smartness’ is framed. The first set of actors, situated between the top and bottom of the smart city hierarchy, are most prominently community associations, non-profit organisations and ad-hoc task groups. The second group is comprised of groups with different digital practices, whose spectre of marginalisation influences how digital systems are articulated and pursued. These actors strategically move between different interstices in order to enact particular kinds of political influence, and often influence smart cities by virtue of their absence, profoundly impacting urban political geographies of smartness.}

abstract = {The current generation of advanced robots essentially considers the external world, including humans, vehicles, and other robots, as navigational issues rather than as team members, opponents, or part of the ambient culture. But robotic systems need true Soldier-Robot Teams where each part of the team understands the roles, responsibilities, and required actions of the others and has the capability to provide the communication necessary to make the team successful. Accomplishing this within a mission context, accepted military doctrine, and social norms of the society in which the human-robot teams operate, represents a major theoretical and technological challenge for research in human-robot teams.}
