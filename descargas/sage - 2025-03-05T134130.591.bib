abstract = {Thermoplastics hold utmost importance in the day-to-day life of modern-day society, being widely employed in water transport and storage vessels commonly made from thermoplastics such as PVC, i.e., polyvinyl chloride, and PP, i.e., polypropylene. This urge for a joining technique is applicable even with water in the vessel or the submerged case. The present investigation explores ultrasonic welding as an option to weld thermoplastics in water-submerged conditions. We have performed FEM simulations and experimental validation to prove the viability of the proposed ultrasonic welding process used in welding PVC and PP in water-submerged conditions. The discussed results demonstrate a decrease in melting and degradation of adherend material at the weld interface while welding PVC and PP in water-submerged conditions and attaining 65.78% and 107% of weld strength, unlike their open-air counterparts, respectively.}

abstract = {The aim of the present work is to predict the fatigue life of a friction stir welded (FSW) joint in the 2024-T351 aluminum alloy using the finite element method in the framework of Fracture Analysis Code for Two Dimensions (FRANC2D/L). The simulation is conducted using linear elastic fracture mechanics based on Paris’ model, and the maximum tensile stress and displacement correlation methods are applied to calculate the crack direction and stress intensity factor, respectively. Several strategies are applied in order to predict the crack propagations through various welded zones regarding the corresponding parameters and Paris constants for each zone. The entire crack growth process is investigated step by step through all of the FSW zones, and the fatigue lifetimes of the FSW joint under various loading conditions are predicted by implementing the same procedure. The numerical results are validated with experimental and analytical work.}

abstract = {With the tremendous growth of science and technology in the world, the silent submarine has been an interesting research topic for many years. What is of equal interest is how to produce a high-speed submarine that limits noise to minimise detection from the enemy. In this study, we investigated the combination of a propeller and a duct so that when a submarine is operated, it minimises as much as possible the noise without affecting the speed of the submarine. The goal of installing the duct outside the propeller is to reduce the noise and loss of thrust simultaneously. The purpose of this article is to investigate the variation of the magnitude of the noise and thrust that occurs when a submarine propeller is operated in six different types of ducts. The research method is to use the large eddy simulation method with the cavitation model and then to calculate the result using the finite volume method. The study found that Ducts 1 and 4 have a better noise reduction effect and better propulsion than the other four ducts. Among them, Duct 4 has the best noise reduction effect, and Duct 1 provides the maximum propulsion. In all of the computation examples herein, the cavitation phenomenon did not occur. In the future, we will continue to study the growth and decline of related physical quantities with various types of propellers and ducts.}

abstract = {There are many benefits of using argumentation-based techniques in multi-agent systems, as clearly shown in the literature. Such benefits come not only from the expressiveness that argumentation-based techniques bring to agent communication but also from the reasoning and decision-making capabilities under conditions of conflicting and uncertain information that argumentation enables for autonomous agents. When developing multi-agent applications in which argumentation will be used to improve agent communication and reasoning, argumentation schemes (reasoning patterns for argumentation) are useful in addressing the requirements of the application domain in regards to argumentation (e.g., defining the scope in which argumentation will be used by agents in that particular application). In this work, we propose an argumentation framework that takes into account the particular structure of argumentation schemes at its core. This paper formally defines such a framework and experimentally evaluates its implementation for both argumentation-based reasoning and dialogues.}

abstract = {This study explores the effects of worked-out examples and metacognitive scaffolding on novice learners’ knowledge performance, cognitive loads, and self-regulation skills in problem-solving programming. 126 undergraduate students in a computer programming fundamentals course were randomly assigned to one of four groups: 1) task performance with a traditional WOE (TW), 2) task performance with a faded WOE (FW), 3) task performance with traditional WOE and metacognitive scaffolding (TWM), and 4) task performance with a faded WOE and metacognitive scaffolding (FWM). Over the course of 3 weeks, participants in these four groups were asked to solve programming problems using Python with WOE and metacognitive scaffolding. The results demonstrate that the provision of metacognitive scaffolding with faded WOE (FWM) is the most effective for problem-solving programming and self-regulation skills. In addition, an interaction effect exists between the two treatments for the germane load in FWM. Therefore, results in this study provide empirical insights into ways to effectively apply WOE and metacognitive scaffolding to problem-solving processes for programming-based complex problem-solving, especially for novice learners.}

abstract = {Complicated flowfields near casing in a transonic axial flow compressor rotor have been numerically investigated in this paper. Two vortex identification methods, namely the Eigenvector Method and Lambda 2 Method, are introduced as important tools for the graphical representation of the concentrated vortices arising from tip leakage flow and blade boundary layer separation. The analysis of the numerical results reveals that multiple tip vortices whose development are dependent on the variation of shock wave configuration are observed at conditions around the peak efficiency point. However, with the decrease of the massflow rate, only the well-known tip leakage vortex and the second tip vortex are left in the tip region due to the disappearance of the second shock wave. Then when the massflow rate further decreases to the stall limit, an deceleration flow region emerges downstream of the shock wave due to an increasing interaction between the first shock wave and the well-known tip leakage vortex. The tip leakage vortex further experiences a bubble-type and then spiral-type breakdown at near stall flow conditions. In addition, the validity of the two vortex identification methods is also discussed in this paper. It is found that both methods are able to identify and accentuate the concentrated streamwise vortices near casing when a vortex is not disrupted. However, if the vortex breakdown occurs, only Eigenvector Method can describe the breakdown region in a deep view.}

abstract = {Three arrangement types of fibrous media have been established including “Mesh” (layered distribution), “Para” (unidirectional distribution), and “Nurbs” (random distribution), with fiber diameters ranging from 5 to 7 µm and solid volume fractions ranging from 14.58% to 21.95%. To describe the filtration performance, particles trajectories, and the influence of structural parameters of fibrous media, the computation fluid dynamics is adopted. The filtration efficiency and the pressure drop of fibrous media are calculated in computation fluid dynamics and semi-analytical model. It is found that the arrangement types have significant effects on the filtration efficiency and show the limitation of the semi-analytical model. With the Stokes number larger than 1, the numerical results and semi-analytical model have great consistency in the filtration efficiency for the “Mesh” and “Para” types than “Nurbs” type. Meanwhile, the pressure drop between the numerical results and the semi-analytical model is always consistent.}

abstract = {Although desktop computers have been considered in many computational fluid dynamics (CFD) indoor simulations, they were usually simplified as hot boxes. A real desktop computer, however, is not only a heat source but also a momentum source due to the jet airflow generated by the computer case fan. The airflow induced by a desktop case fan could have the same order of magnitude as the ventilation rate of the whole room, and thus is expected to have significant influence upon the indoor airflow field and distribution of contaminants. Obviously, the simplification of desktop computer into a hot box does not sufficiently stand for the actual situation. In this study, a CFD model of a typical office room was built and simulations were conducted to investigate the airflow field and volatile organic compounds (VOC) distribution under two scenarios: (1) computer as a ‘hot box’ without a fan and (2) a more realistic computer model with an operating case fan. The comparison of CFD results yielded from these two scenarios demonstrated that the role of computer fan is very important in terms of airflow field and contaminant distribution and should be included in CFD office simulations for the purpose of improved reliability.}
