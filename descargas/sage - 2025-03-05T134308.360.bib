abstract = {The objective of the paper is to investigate the internal flow characteristics inside the inducer under the gas-water condition using a combination of experiment and numerical simulations. Gas-water mixing is achieved by an annular gas mixing device and visualized by high-speed imaging technology. Meanwhile, the shear stress transport (SST) k-ω model coupled with the VOF model is applied to investigate the gas phase distribution. Numerically simulated inducer energy characteristics and internal gas-phase distribution are in good agreement with experimental data. The results show that the mixed gas-liquid flow inside the inducer exhibits three flow patterns: wavy flow, bubbly flow, and plug flow. For the wavy flow, a series of wavy structures on the blade surface and gas-pocket bubbles near the blade rim are observed. From wavy flow to bubbly flow, uniform bubble streams on the blade surface and spiraling strip bubbles near the edge of the blade are observed. For plug flow, bubble accumulation results in a bullet-shaped plug, and the strip-shaped bubbles near the blade rim are more obvious. In the same axial position of the inducer, the proportion of gas phase is increasing as the flow coefficient increases, thus affecting the inducer performance. The main frequency amplitude of the pressure pulsations gradually rise when the flow pattern changes from wavy to plug flow.}

abstract = {Despite the importance of software interfaces, trade-offs must be made during development. Value Focused Thinking (VFT) provides an objective methodology that is well suited for handling multi-objective problems such as interface design issues. Facilitated sessions are held with the intended users to elicit what is of importance to the user. These values are characterized and put to a common scale, allowing measurement of their contribution to the overall objective. The resulting hierarchy can be used to guide software development or compare different interface solutions. In this study, a VFT hierarchy was developed with military intelligence analysts to identify what values were desired in an interface for software intended to address a facet of data overload. The prototype interface was evaluated against the hierarchy with these stated values. The process and the hierarchy itself provided insight on where resources should be expended to provide the greatest benefit in the final product.}

abstract = {Excitation energy migration between dyes embedded in hexagonal crystals of cylinder morphology is an attractive phenomenon for the construction of photonic antennae [1, 2]. Detailed knowledge of the zeolite structure, the organization and the spectroscopic properties of the dyes and the nature and strength of the host-guest interactions is required to optimize energy migration (EnM). Whether a dye-zeolite antenna efficiently transports excitation energy is mainly determined by the mechanism and rate of energy transfer (EnT) between the dyes embedded in the zeolite channels. The decay of the luminescence of these dyes, which reveals information about the EnT, is measured indirectly using Multi-Frequency Phase Fluorimetry (MFPF). Subsequently a fit of the measured data to a multiexponential decay is performed. A new, user-friendly Windows software has been developed which performs this fit, allowing full control over all fit parameters and providing useful information about the quality of the fit. The software also contains a database capable of storing all the relevant information related to the experiment. It is therefore a highly optimized analysis and managing tool for our experimental method which has greatly improved the efficiency of data analysis. The software is highly flexible and can easily be adapted to other experimental methods.}

abstract = {Item response theory (IRT) models typically rely on a normality assumption for subject-specific latent traits, which is often unrealistic in practice. Semiparametric extensions based on Dirichlet process mixtures (DPMs) offer a more flexible representation of the unknown distribution of the latent trait. However, the use of such models in the IRT literature has been extremely limited, in good part because of the lack of comprehensive studies and accessible software tools. This article provides guidance for practitioners on semiparametric IRT models and their implementation. In particular, we rely on NIMBLE, a flexible software system for hierarchical models that enables the use of DPMs. We highlight efficient sampling strategies for model estimation and compare inferential results under parametric and semiparametric models.}

abstract = {In elasticity, microstructure-related deviations may be modeled by strain gradient elasticity. For so-called metamaterials, different implementations are possible for solving strain gradient elasticity problems numerically. Analytical solutions of simple problems are used to verify the numerical approach. We demonstrate such a case in a two-dimensional continuum as a benchmark case for computations. As strain gradient enforces higher regularity conditions in displacements, in the finite element method (FEM), the use of standard elements is often seen as inadequate. For such piecewise or elementwise continuous elements, we examine a possible remedy to correctly simulate strain gradient elasticity problems by implementing two techniques. First, we enforce continuity of displacement gradient across elements; second, we employ a mixed finite element method where displacement and its gradient are solved both as unknowns. The results show the pros and cons of each numerical technique. All methods converge monotonically, but the mixed method is more reliable than the other one.}

This problem is modeled as a dynamic traveling repairman problem with time windows, and with three objectives considered: maximization of the number of serviced customers, minimization of customer waiting, and minimization of total travel time. A solution (simulation) framework, extending techniques developed for single-objective dynamic routing problems in the literature, is proposed to tackle this multiobjective problem. An efficient chained local search heuristic is embedded in this solution framework to solve the underlying static problem, the traveling salesman problem with time windows. Comprehensive simulation experiments conducted on data sets derived from benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithmic approach is able to provide high-quality solutions with limited computing effort. These experiments also indicate that the multiobjective model proposed in this study can offer much more attractive solutions to decision makers than single-objective models.}

abstract = {The purpose of this research is to examine one of the most effective approaches for locating niche tourism attractions that varies by people, using a methodology that combines statistical analysis, deep learning visual image detection, and text mining. Using 30,013 posts with the hashtag #Seoul in English, the analysis focused on the Instagram posts’ time, dominant color, image visual content, and hashtag to identify niche tourism attractions. The analysis result shows that Instagram posts hashtag #Seoul that depicted “young women” and was uploaded in the evening with warm colors such as orange, yellow, and green received more “likes” than other postings. Furthermore, deep learning and text mining analysis were used to identify and forecast the actual image with the most likes in each sectoral domain, as classified by topic modeling, such as “young, woman, outdoor” and “table, plate, indoor.” Through these findings, this study identified niche hotspots of tourism attractions based on those destination image attributes in Instagram photos, which contributes to the popularity of Instagram postings. The methods and results will be particularly useful to marketers and researchers looking to uncover specialized tourism themes and combine popularity measurement with visual image analysis.}
