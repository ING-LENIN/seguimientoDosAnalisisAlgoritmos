abstract = {Indigenous people are significantly underrepresented in the fields of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). The solution to this problem requires a more robust lens than representation or access alone. Specifically, it will require careful consideration of the ecological contexts of Indigenous school age youth, of which more than 70% live in urban communities (National Urban Indian Family Coalition, 2008). This article reports emergent design principles derived from a community-based design research project. These emergent principles focus on the conceptualization and uses of technology in science learning environments designed for urban Indigenous youth. In order to strengthen learning environments for urban Indigenous youth, it is necessary, we argue, that scholars and educators take seriously the ways in which culture mediates relationships with, conceptions of, and innovations in technology and technologically related disciplines. Recognizing these relationships will inform the subsequent implications for learning environments.}

abstract = {This article reports on a year-long study of high school students learning computer programming. The study examined three issues: 1) what is the impact of programming on particular mathematical and reasoning abilities?; 2) what cognitive skills or abilities best predict programming ability?; and 3) what do students actually understand about programming after two years of high school study? The results showed that even after two years of study, many students had only a rudimentary understanding of programming. Consequently, it was not surprising to also find that programming experience (as opposed to expertise) does not appear to transfer to other domains which share analogous formal properties. The article concludes that we need to more closely study the pedagogy of programming and how expertise can be better attained before we prematurely go looking for significant and wide reaching transfer effects from programming.}

abstract = {Aims and objectives/purpose/research questions: Using a foreign language is suggested to affect how we think, even reducing bias. However, the exact mechanisms of its influence are still unknown. In this project, we tested two variants of the “thinking more” mechanism driving the foreign language effect: increased cognitive reflection and greater task engagement. Design/methodology/approach: We analyzed previously collected data from five experiments employing the Cognitive Reflection Test (CRT) and/or the Berlin Numeracy Test (BNT), each administered in the native or foreign language. If the increased reflection explanation is true, the CRT score should be higher in participants using a foreign language. If the greater task engagement explanation is true, the BNT score should be higher in participants using a foreign language. Data and analysis: We report data from N = 1,288 participants who filled the CRT and N = 413 who filled the BNT. Data were analyzed using the NHST approach and its Bayesian alternative over a spectrum of liberal, default, and conservative priors. Data are publicly available at https://osf.io/m8tn9 Findings/conclusions: All the test results were nonsignificant and showed anecdotal to strong evidence that neither the CRT nor the BNT scores improved in the foreign language condition, also when controlling for proficiency. The proportion of intuitive to computational errors was also unaffected. Originality: We are the first to comprehensively test the thinking-more explanation of the foreign language effect. Significance/Implications: Our results undermine the claim that using a foreign language promotes more cognitive reflection or engagement. The foreign language effect likely has a different cause.}

abstract = {Information technology and computer science represent one area of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) that have experienced significant growth in recent years. As such, federal policy has urged schools to embed new types of STEM courses into the curriculum. As one very prominent example, computer science (CS)-focused courses are a growing branch of career and technical education (CTE)—that is, CS-CTE. While previous research has examined coursetaking patterns and subsequent outcomes of CS-CTE courses for the general student population, little is known about how participation in these courses may benefit students with learning disabilities (SWLDs). From a pedagogical perspective, CS-CTE courses, and CTE courses in general, may be uniquely positioned to improve schooling outcomes for SWLDs. Using data from the nationally representative High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, we explored characteristics of CS-CTE participants, how CS-CTE may promote the development of key STEM attitudes (e.g., identity, self-efficacy, and utility), and how any relationships may differ by learning disability status. Using a double propensity score matching estimations, we found CS-CTE participation related to positive development of STEM identity and STEM self-efficacy for students without learning disabilities. For the SWLD population, CS-CTE participation was associated with growth in STEM self-efficacy and STEM utility. Policy implications discuss the gap in computer science employment between SWLDs and non-SWLDs, the prevalence of state-related computer science policies, and how to continue to promote STEM identity growth.}

abstract = {The basal ganglia are an intricately connected assembly of subcortical nuclei, forming the core of an adaptive network connecting cortical and thalamic circuits. For nearly three decades, researchers and medical practitioners have conceptualized how the basal ganglia circuit works, and how its pathology underlies motor disorders such as Parkinson’s and Huntington’s diseases, using what is often referred to as the “box-and-arrow model”: a circuit diagram showing the broad strokes of basal ganglia connectivity and the pathological increases and decreases in the weights of specific connections that occur in disease. While this model still has great utility and has led to groundbreaking strategies to treat motor disorders, our evolving knowledge of basal ganglia function has made it clear that this classic model has several shortcomings that severely limit its predictive and descriptive abilities. In this review, we will focus on the striatum, the main input nucleus of the basal ganglia. We describe recent advances in our understanding of the rich microcircuitry and plastic capabilities of the striatum, factors not captured by the original box-and-arrow model, and provide examples of how such advances inform our current understanding of the circuit pathologies underlying motor disorders.}

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations and experimental steady flow tests (flow discharge, swirl, and tumble) were carried out to study the in-cylinder flow in a commercial four-valve spark ignition engine. The present investigation was aimed at analysing and controlling the generation of macro-vortex structures (swirl and tumble) during the inlet process. A comparative study of the most commonly employed tumble benches along with in-house design was performed, the last showing some advantages with respect to the others. The outcomes from the simulations were in agreement with experimental results. Mainly, the tumble generation rate was in general proportional to the valve lift. However, tumble was reduced drastically at medium valve lift due to a change in the vortex pattern. A stagnation zone was observed between inlet valves. CFD calculations successfully captured this tumble-fall effect, which was related to characteristic changes in the vortex pattern downstream of the inlet valves at medium valve lift. This affects tumble production without affecting the mass flowrate efficiency. Finally, at high valve lifts the tumble production and the vortex pattern were recovered. The capability of the cylinder head to induce swirl, tumble, or combined swirl–tumble by modifying the valve timing or by introducing adjustable flow deflectors was evaluated using CFD. Several valve timing strategies were analysed: some of them produced significant swirl, but introduced high mass flowrate losses. On the other hand, adjustable flow deflectors were shown to be an interesting alternative to induce swirl–tumble at low load and to improve tumble at high load.}

abstract = {Given the strong influence of teachers educators’ pedagogical modeling on new teachers’ capacity to use technology to support student learning, this study sought to answer two interrelated questions: (a) How are teacher educators and teacher education programs currently working to prepare teachers to integrate technology? and (b) How are teacher educators implementing the TPACK (complex integration of technological [T], pedagogical [P], and content [C] knowledge [K]) model? The evidence to answer these questions was derived from an analysis of quantitative and qualitative survey responses from 843 teacher educators from approximately half (n = 541) of the accredited teacher education programs in the country. The results showed that teacher educators are increasingly integrating technology across the curriculum, that there is a fairly low level of TPACK adoption, and that conceptions of TPACK vary greatly. The study helps to better understand these teacher educator practices in relationship to the literature on preparing teachers to use technology to support student learning.}
