abstract = {Cognitive control refers to the processes by which individual cognitive functions are coordinated in the service of higher-level goals. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in the middle front of the brain monitors performance, and it is activated when the need for control increases—for instance, in difficult situations or when errors occur. Since the late 1990s, the ACC has been thought to signal when there is conflict between competing action plans so that the conflict can be resolved. More recently, an alternative model has reconceptualized the role of ACC as that of a predictor and evaluator of the likely outcomes of planned actions before the actions are performed. This new Predicted Response Outcome model accounts for a broader range of findings than the earlier framework and suggests that the ACC might support the cognitive operations by which individuals can “think before they act” in order to avoid risky or otherwise poor choices.}

abstract = {Research on early childhood robotics education often focuses narrowly on teaching young children STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) concepts and skills. In this qualitative case study, our research team examined what happened when we worked with young children (age 7) and combined the technologies of robotics education with an inquiry approach, that is, an opportunity for students to collaboratively identify a problem arising from their own lived experiences and build a robot to solve it. We found that the process of children’s problem identification was dialogic, not only with peers and teachers but also with materials, as they defined and refined problems based on interactions with peers and objects. As this study was conducted at an economically disadvantaged public school in the Southern United States, we argue that early childhood robotics education has a great potential to engage young children in STEM learning in a personally meaningful manner and that an instructional approach fostering children’s inquiry and project-based learning through their problem finding and problem posing is effective in making STEM accessible to students from diverse backgrounds.}

abstract = {Heat affected zone on the micromachined material, a hindrance in achieving good precision and accuracy, which are adequate requirements for micromachined materials, is a drawback of nanosecond micromachining assisted by laser. The primary objective of this paper is to take into consideration a number of input parameters, such as the pulse width and the temperature of the laser beam, and study the effect that these parameters have on the heat flux generated as well as on the temperature distribution along the square grooves of 200 µm width and depth that are to be micro-machined on an alumina ceramic workpiece. However, processing of alumina ceramic on a micron-scale requires careful consideration to raise the quality standard. This will be accomplished by analyzing the data collected from the micro-machining process. Using the ANSYS® software, it is possible to visualize not only the region where heat is generated but also the way in which the input parameters influence the structural qualities of the micro machined groove surface. The many thermal models that have been constructed have revealed specific changes in the structural qualities that have had a significant impact on the upper width, the lower width, and the depth of the groove when applied to a variety of different parametric settings. Finally, developed analytical model is compared with the experimental models. The highest prediction error was found to be 1.68%, while, for constant 50 W power and 150–250 mm/s of speed, the average prediction error was determined to be 1.18%. As a result, the proposed model closely matches the experimental findings, and the proposed model can be used to estimate channel profile.}

abstract = {In this paper I explore the possibility that recursion is not part of the cognitive repertoire of non-human primates such as chimpanzees due to limited working memory capacity. Multiple lines of data, from nut cracking to the velocity and duration of cognitive development, imply that chimpanzees have a short-term memory size that limits working memory to dealing with two, or at most three, concepts at a time. If so, as a species they lack the cognitive capacity for recursive thinking to be integrated into systems of social organization and communication. If this limited working memory capacity is projected back to a common ancestor for Pan and Homo, it follows that early hominid ancestors would have had limited working memory capacity. Hence we should find evidence for expansion of working memory capacity during hominid evolution reflected in changes in the products of conceptually framed activities such as stone tool production. Data on the artifacts made by our hominid ancestors support this expansion hypothesis for hominid working memory, thereby leading to qualitative differences between Pan and Homo.}

abstract = {Carbon nanofiller–modified polymers have been the subject of intense study for years due to their potential use in diverse and far-reaching applications. The effect of nanofiller network parameters on macroscale direct current electrical transport has been thoroughly elucidated by extensive nano-to-microscale modeling. As a result, we now have great insight into how the conductive and piezoresistive properties of nanocomposites can be tailored through judicious control of the underlying nanofiller network. It is also well-known that carbon nanofiller–modified polymers possess frequency-dependent alternating current electrical properties. Even though work has been done to understand the alternating current properties of nanocomposites via experimental characterization and through the development of macroscale equivalent circuit models, much less has been done to understand how macroscale alternating current conductivity depends on microscale effects such as nanofiller alignment and aspect ratio. This is an important knowledge gap because, like direct current conductivity, the underlying nanofiller network ultimately gives rise to macroscale alternating current transport in these materials. To this end, we herein present an alternating current microscale percolation model for carbon filler–based polymer nanocomposites. After calibration against experimental complex impedance data from randomly ordered carbon nanofiber–modified epoxy, this model is used to explore the effect of carbon nanofiber alignment and aspect ratio on alternating current conductivity. These simulations show that alternating current conductivity generally increases with increasing alignment and with aspect ratio; however, the competing effects of alternating current and direct current percolation give rise to substantial variation in alternating current conductivity at low frequencies and with poor percolation. The methodology presented in this article provides a modeling tool by which nanocomposites with highly optimized alternating current properties can be developed through careful control and tailoring of nanofiller network properties for the realization of exotic, next-generation material functionality.}
