N2 - Minimum miscibility pressure is the least required pressure for complete mixing of gas and oil in the reservoir conditions. It is an important parameter in the processes of gas injection in a miscible manner and its precise determination is very vital in choosing the type of injecting gas and planning injecting equipment for increasing the recovery efficiency. The common method is determining MMP in slim tube or 1-D simulation of slim tube. Usually determining the minimum miscibility pressure via slim tube apparatus is an expensive and time-consuming test and to carry it out it is necessary to have a sample of reservoir oil and suggested injecting gas. Occasionally it is possible that for some unknown reasons despite spending much time and money it won’t bring up any result. As a result, for determining this parameter, finding another method which has a higher precision in addition to being swift and less expensive is very necessary. On the other hand, there are several simulation methods to determine minimum miscibility pressure. These methods are so fast rather than slim tube experiment and relatively precise. MMP can be estimated numerically using compositional simulation, method of characteristics (MOC), mixing-cell methods, intelligent methods, and empirical correlations. However, nowadays one dimensional (1-D) slim tube simulation based on compositional simulation is very common. In this paper a suggestive method is proposed for determining MMP. A mixing rule method coupled with artificial neural network model (ANN) based on a numerous experiment data. Accuracy and computational time of artificial neural network method were compared to common prior models and correlations. The results show although intelligent methods are so fast, 1-D slim tube simulation is still a proper method to determine MMP in high accuracy. Average absolute relative error for MMP value is 1.5% for 1-D slim tube simulation, while the number for ANN is 3.25%. However, ANN method is recommended for fast MMP estimation.

N2 - This article’s aim is to explore the possibilities and limitations of some quantitative tools for the analysis of images. It shows how three different families of tools – manual annotation, eye-tracking and signifier analysis – can help to better understand the meaning effects of figurative and plastic (abstract) elements in pictures. Advantages and disadvantages for each family of tools are discussed. The author also suggests some theoretical implications of the adoption of quantitative tools in the humanities and especially within semiotic disciplines.

N2 - The organizational structure is described for a new program that permits computa tions on a variety of quantum mechanical problems in chemical dynamics and spec troscopy. Particular attention was devoted to developing and using algorithms that exploit the capabilities of current vector supercomputers. A key component in this procedure is the recursive transformation of the large sparse Hamiltonian matrix into a much smaller tridiagonal matrix. An ap plication to time-dependent laser-mole cule energy transfer is presented. Rate of energy deposition in the multimode mole cule for systematic variations in the mo lecular intermode coupling parameters is emphasized.

N2 - System knowledge and reasoning mechanisms are essential means for intellectualization of cyber-physical systems (CPSs). As enablers of system intelligence, they make such systems able to solve application problems and to maintain their efficient operation. Normally, system intelligence has a human-created initial part and a system-produced (extending) part, called synthetic system intelligence (SSI). This position paper claims that SSI can be converted to a new industrial asset and utilized as such. Unfortunately, no overall theory of SSI exists and its conceptual framework, management strategy, and computational methodologies are still in a premature stage. This is the main reason why no significant progress has been achieved in this field, contrary to the latent potentials. This paper intends to contribute to: (i) understanding the nature and fundamentals of SSI, (ii) systematizing the elicitation and transfer of SSI, (iii) exploration of analogical approaches to utilization of SSI, and (iv) road-mapping and scenario development for the exploitation of SSI as an industrial asset. First, the state of the art is surveyed and the major findings are presented. Then, four families of analogical approaches to SSI transfer are analyzed. These are: (i) knowledge transfer based on repositories, (ii) transfer among agents, (iii) transfer of learning resources, and (iv) transfer by emerging approaches. A procedural framework is proposed that identifies the generic functionalities needed for a quasi-autonomous handling of SSI as an industrial asset. The last section casts light on some important open issues and necessary follow-up research and development activities.

N2 - Abstract We analyzed the interrelationships between mixture heterogeneity and reaction in a premixed charge compression ignition (PCCI) combustion, using large eddy simulation (LES) in conjunction with a reaction kinetics model. The aim of this analysis is to find the statistical characteristics of the mixture heterogeneity in a turbulent flowfield for moderating the PCCI combustion and for increasing an output limit, which is restricted by a severe knock. Several different initial conditions of heterogeneity of an air-fuel or air-fuel-EGR gas mixture were given at the intake valve closing time by a new method, which generated statistically reasonable turbulent fluctuations in both velocity and fuel mass fraction fields. The autoignition and combustion behaviours were analysed for several different sets of the r.m.s. and the length scale of the fluctuations in the fuel mass fraction. The analyses show that the combination of a larger r.m.s. value and a longer-length scale of the fluctuations in fuel mass fraction is effective to slow the combustion in a hot flame reaction phase and to avoid knocking. The analytical results also show that the heterogeneous distribution of an EGR gas has a considerable effect in making the combustion slower, even when a fuel-air mixture is homogeneous.

N2 - The process of coating textiles with a blade coater has been investigated with CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) software. The simulations have uncovered a pressure drop in the area between the edge of the knife and the textile. This drop can be explained by the varying height of the flow channel which is made of the knife and the textile in conjunction with the no slip condition that is applied to the walls. In the simulations this drop became arbitrarily deep with increasing viscosity leading to negative absolute pressure levels. This may be a hint that the no slip condition is not valid in this scenario that involves shear rates of the order of 103/s and dynamic viscosities of around 10 to 100Pas. With a proposed slip condition for the textile the pressure drop became less pronounced. At the same time the flow rate through the gap between knife and textile was reduced leading to a thinner coating. This can be a hint that a slip between coating material and textile can cause distortions in the coating up to a complete disruption which is reported frequently by the industry. This could eventually be avoided by reducing the varying height of the flow channel. Alternatively a vertical lift of the textile due to the negative pressure was taken into account. This lift appeared only with low tensions of the textile of about 1N/m and showed no influence on coating thickness and pressure drop.
