N2 - As part of a recent animal facility refurbishment, a cubicle containment system was designed to increase the amount of experimental space and also provide containment facilities to support the holding and use of specialized animal models. In order to achieve this, a series of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) studies was undertaken to evaluate the effects of different airflows and in order to optimize ventilation, a variety of exhaust/supply arrangements and animal loads was employed. These studies showed that air delivered via two, opposed, low level ducts, at a rate of 20 air changes per hour and exhausted high in the cubicle above the rack, was the optimal configuration resulting in minimal turbulence, stagnation and entrainment.

N2 - Is the relationship between criminal thinking and recidivism the same for criminal justice–involved individuals from varying demographic backgrounds? Relying on two independent samples of offenders and two measures of criminal thinking, the current studies examined whether four demographic factors—gender, race, age, and education—moderated the relationship between criminal thinking and recidivism. Study 1 consisted of 226 drug-involved probationers enrolled in a randomized clinical trial. Study 2 consisted of 346 jail inmates from a longitudinal study. Logistic regression models suggested that the strength of the relationship between criminal thinking and subsequent recidivism did not vary based on participant demographics, regardless of justice system setting or measure of criminal thinking. Criminal thinking predicts recidivism similarly for people who are male, female, Black, White, older, younger, and more or less educated.

N2 - The application of a previously developed computational method to the prediction of high-lift performance for multi-element aerofoil sections operating at transonic flow conditions is described. The flows are computed by solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations, using a full differential Reynolds-stress turbulence model to evaluate the various Reynolds-stress components appearing in the governing mean-flow equations. Algebraic wall functions are used to bridge the molecular viscosity-dominated region immediately adjacent to the aerofoil surfaces. An unstructured grid-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology is used to deal with the geometric complexity of the multi-element aerofoil configurations. Initial results are presented for the viscous, transonic flow development around the SKF 1.1 supercritical aerofoil section, equipped with either a trailing-edge flap or a leading-edge slat. Predicted surface pressure distributions generally compare well with experimental data for the two high-lift aerofoil geometries considered, at a free-stream Mach number of 0.6 and over a range of incidence angles. There are some discrepancies in the regions immediately downstream of shock wave/boundary layer interactions, possibly resulting from the use of wall-function boundary conditions in the computations. Predicted Mach number contours indicate the complexity of the transonic flow fields for high-lift configurations, with the slat wake passing through an extensive supersonic-flow region, terminated by a normal shock wave, on the main aerofoil upper surface, for example.

N2 - This article analyzes the configuration of fear generated by the computational monster in computer games. We view the monster as a computational entity, which we approach through our theory of game-play coupled with the concepts of loss aversion and endowment effect. Of particular interest is player perception of the threat posed by monsters as they perturb the experience of progression and the sensation of control within the game. We scrutinize this aspect from a situational as well as an existential perspective. Furthermore, we advance an analytical scheme of the threat of the computational monster, which is radically different from the traditional academic approach with its emphasis on the representation of monsters. Overall, we argue that the threat players perceive when facing monsters in computer games springs more from the computational nature of monsters—how they upset progression and the feeling of control—and less from the representation of the monster(s).

N2 - Stainless steel alloys are widely used in many important applications but their production presents difficulties because they contain expensive chromium, which can be extensively oxidised during decarburisation to the very low carbon levels required. Modern stainless steelmaking largely avoids this problem by having two distinct stages and is therefore described as duplex practice. Molten high carbon stainless steel is produced in an electric arc furnace and then the melt is decarburised in an argon–oxygen converter or a vacuum oxygen decarburising converter. In this work, computational thermodynamics has been used to examine the major reactions occurring in the electric arc furnace and to show the effect of various process variables on chromium recovery. It was shown that significant oxidation of the scrap must occur during melting, and that subsequent carbon/oxygen injection initially oxidises some chromium, but then mostly oxidises the added carbon. Chromium was predicted to exist in the slag as CrO and CrO1·5 in almost equal proportions. Increasing the temperature should improve chromium recovery but results in less benefit than expected due to the decreasing activity coefficients of CrO and CrO1·5 and the increasing oxygen partial pressure. Ferrosilicon additions reduce chromium oxides from the slag, but much of the silicon simply dissolves into the steel. Computational thermodynamics is seen to be a very effective educational tool for gaining an understanding of smelting processes.

N2 - We developed a novel concept of endovascular thrombolysis that employs a vibrating electroactive polymer actuator. In order to predict the efficacy of thrombolysis using the developed vibrating actuator, enzyme (plasminogen activator) perfusion into a clot was analyzed by solving flow fields and species transport equations considering the fluid structure interaction. In vitro thrombolysis experiments were also performed. Computational results showed that plasminogen activator perfusion into a clot was enhanced by actuator vibration at frequencies of 1 and 5 Hz. Plasminogen activator perfusion was affected by the actuator oscillation frequencies and amplitudes that were determined by electromechanical characteristics of a polymer actuator. Computed plasminogen activator perfused volumes were compared with experimentally measured dissolved clot volumes. The computed plasminogen activator perfusion volumes with threshold concentrations of 16% of the initial plasminogen activator concentration agreed well with the in vitro experimental data. This study showed the effectiveness of actuator oscillation on thrombolysis and the validity of the computational plasminogen activator perfusion model for predicting thrombolysis in complex flow fields induced by an oscillating actuator.

N2 - Abstract Experimental data from internal combustion (IC) engines suggests that the use of proprietary computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes for the prediction of coolant-side heat transfer within IC engine coolant jackets often results in underprediction of the convective heat transfer coefficient. An experimental and computational study, based on a coolant gallery simulator rig designed specifically to reproduce realistic IC engine operating conditions, has been conducted to explore this issue. It is shown that the standard ‘wall function’ approach normally used in CFD models to model near-wall conditions does not adequately represent some features of the flow that are relevant in convective heat transfer. Alternative modelling approaches are explored to account for these shortcomings and an empirical approach is shown to be successful; however, the methodology is not easily transferable to other situations.

N2 - To design a comfortable aircraft cabin environment, designers conventionally follow an iterative guess-and-correction procedure to determine the air-supply parameters. The conventional method has an extremely low efficiency but does not guarantee an optimal design. This investigation proposed an inverse design method based on a proper orthogonal decomposition of the thermo-flow data provided by full computational fluid dynamics simulations. The orthogonal spatial modes of the thermo-flow fields and corresponding coefficients were firstly extracted. Then, a thermo-flow field was expressed into a linear combination of the spatial modes with their coefficients. The coefficients for each spatial mode are functions of air-supply parameters, which can be interpolated. With a quick map of the cause–effect relationship between the air-supply parameters and the exhibited thermo-flow fields, the optimal air-supply parameters were determined from specific design targets. By setting the percentage of dissatisfied and the predicted mean vote as design targets, the proposed method was implemented for inverse determination of air-supply parameters in two aircraft cabins. The results show that the inverse design using computational fluid dynamics-based proper orthogonal decomposition method is viable. Most of computing time lies in the construction of data samples of thermo-flow fields, while the proper orthogonal decomposition analysis and data interpolation is efficient.

N2 - Model uncertainty is pervasive in social science. A key question is how robust empirical results are to sensible changes in model specification. We present a new approach and applied statistical software for computational multimodel analysis. Our approach proceeds in two steps: First, we estimate the modeling distribution of estimates across all combinations of possible controls as well as specified functional form issues, variable definitions, standard error calculations, and estimation commands. This allows analysts to present their core, preferred estimate in the context of a distribution of plausible estimates. Second, we develop a model influence analysis showing how each model ingredient affects the coefficient of interest. This shows which model assumptions, if any, are critical to obtaining an empirical result. We demonstrate the architecture and interpretation of multimodel analysis using data on the union wage premium, gender dynamics in mortgage lending, and tax flight migration among U.S. states. These illustrate how initial results can be strongly robust to alternative model specifications or remarkably dependent on a knife-edge specification.

N2 - Purpose This article takes a postfoundational lens to reflect upon my ethnographic (re)searching experience in a Hong Kong high school biology classroom to expose ignorant theoretical–methodological assumptions of researchers and teachers on critical thinking for new realizations. Design/Approach/Methods Using an encountered embodied thinking moment as a trigger, this article examines the texts/discourses collected from teachers/teaching and students/learning to unpack underlying philosophical–theoretical–methodological traps and ignorance. Findings The analysis exposes three ignorant assumptions. First is a mind–body dualism that has historically disembodied thinking as an abstract and invisible mind/cognitive activity. Second is a knowledge–skill/thinking divide that upgrades critical thinking as a transferrable higher-order skill above and external to knowledge. Third is a naturalized assumption that didactic instructions in Asian classrooms are not as conducive to thinking cultivation as (Western) student-centered pedagogies. Originality/Value My postfoundational reflections interrogate and expand these philosophical–theoretical–methodological grounds to reconstruct effective thinking curricula and classrooms.
