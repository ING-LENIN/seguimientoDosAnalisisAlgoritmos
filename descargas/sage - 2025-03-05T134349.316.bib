N2 - Modeling an intelligent adversary has provided great challenges to simulated training realism. Traditional approaches to modeling have relied on rule-based and analytical decision-making models in an attempt to optimize the decision making of an intelligent computer-generated adversary. In order to promote realistic transfer of training in the realm of command and control, the trainee must experience realistic decision-making behavior in the enemy. This means that the enemy must make realistic decisions based on environmental constraints, goals, and intent. The enemy’s decisions must then be reflected by the simulated agents. The Recognition-Primed Decision (RPD) Model is a descriptive model of expert decision making in real-world settings. We have several related projects where the goal is to translate the conceptual RPD Model into a computer model that can simulate realistic expert decision making. In attempting this feat, we have discovered many valuable lessons about modeling cognition and decision making, and about the assumptions and mechanisms underlying the RPD Model. The purpose of this paper is to report those findings.

N2 - This study investigated teachers’ use of knowledge from research on children’s mathematical thinking and how their students’ achievement is influenced as a result. Twenty first grade teachers, assigned randomly to an experimental treatment, participated in a month-long workshop in which they studied a research-based analysis of children’s development of problem-solving skills in addition and subtraction. Other first grade teachers (n = 20) were assigned randomly to a control group. Although instructional practices were not prescribed, experimental teachers taught problem solving significantly more and number facts significantly less than did control teachers. Experimental teachers encouraged students to use a variety of problem-solving strategies, and they listened to processes their students used significantly more than did control teachers. Experimental teachers knew more about individual students’ problem-solving processes, and they believed that instruction should build on students’ existing knowledge more than did control teachers. Students in experimental classes exceeded students in control classes in number fact knowledge, problem solving, reported understanding, and reported confidence in their problem-solving abilities.

N2 - This study reflects on Harold Kincaid and Jule Zahle’s view that there is no necessary association between methodological individualism and agent-based models because the analysis of social phenomena in terms of the latter cannot always be regarded as an implementation of the former. Their view remains in contention with the standpoint of several philosophers of science and social scientists, including Chen and Di Iorio. Kincaid and Zahle’s main argument against such a standpoint is that agent-based simulation is compatible with holistic explanations that are at odds with methodological individualism. The following study argues that Kincaid and Zahle’s conclusion remains untenable since it stems from inaccurate historical assumptions concerning the tradition of methodological individualism and the way the individualism-holism debate is understood within this tradition.

N2 - Critical thinking about international politics often involves reasoning about the beliefs, goals, appraisals, actions, and plans of actors such as countries, governments, politicians, etc. We analyzed arguments in interpretive reports about international politics, in order to develop a prototype argument diagramming tool for this domain, AVIZE (Argument Visualization and Evaluation). The purpose of AVIZE is to aid users in the construction and self-evaluation of real-world arguments in the domain of international politics. AVIZE provides a set of argument schemes as cognitive building blocks for constructing argument diagrams. Most of the schemes are related to concepts from the field of automated plan recognition in artificial intelligence. While some currently available argument diagramming tools provide schemes, they are not tailored to the domain of international politics. This paper describes the argument schemes for this domain and the design of the argument diagramming tool.

N2 - In this study, solid Scots pine was surface densified in an open press using different moisture contents (9·6 and 12·4%), temperatures (150 and 200°C), press closing times (0·5 and 5 min), holding times (1 and 10 min) and compression ratios (6·7 and 25%). The characteristics of the formed density profiles were defined and their correlations to the process parameters and Brinell hardness and elastic recovery were analysed. Compression ratio and closing time had the strongest effect on the formation of the density profile, as well as the hardness and elastic recovery. The amount of localised deformation (peak area) did not have significant effect on the Brinell hardness or elastic recovery, whereas, the highest density achieved (peak density) and its location (peak distance) dominated the effect. Brinell hardness and elastic recovery were found to correlate well with each other.

N2 - Trustworthy-looking faces are also perceived as more attractive, but are there other meaningful cues that contribute to perceived trustworthiness? Using data-driven models, we identify these cues after removing attractiveness cues. In Experiment 1, we show that both judgments of trustworthiness and attractiveness of faces manipulated by a model of perceived trustworthiness change in the same direction. To control for the effect of attractiveness, we build two new models of perceived trustworthiness: a subtraction model, which forces the perceived attractiveness and trustworthiness to be negatively correlated (Experiment 2), and an orthogonal model, which reduces their correlation (Experiment 3). In both experiments, faces manipulated to appear more trustworthy were indeed perceived to be more trustworthy, but not more attractive. Importantly, in both experiments, these faces were also perceived as more approachable and with more positive expressions, as indicated by both judgments and machine learning algorithms. The current studies show that the visual cues used for trustworthiness and attractiveness judgments can be separated, and that apparent approachability and facial emotion are driving trustworthiness judgments and possibly general valence evaluation.
