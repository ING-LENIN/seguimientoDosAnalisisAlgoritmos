abstract = {The fabric air dispersion system (FADS) is a ventilation terminal made of special polymer fabric. The porous structure of the fabric causes complex flow motion. Due to its advantages over the conventional ventilation system, i.e. ducts and diffusers, the FADS has been widely favoured by architects and researchers. In computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation the FADS is usually simplified into a free opening with an area equal to all pores and perforations, called the free area (FA) method in this present work. However, the effectiveness of this simplified method has not been validated. The present work took a half cylindrical FADS without orifices as an example and employed the FA method to simulate the airflow properties inside a chamber under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. The simulated distributions of air velocity and temperature were compared with those by the direct description (DD) method. Meanwhile, the uniformity of air velocity distribution close to the FADS was validated against test data and the flow visualization using the dry ice as a smoking material. Results demonstrate that the FA method is effective and easy to implement, and performs as well as the DD method in predicting the distribution of airflow generated by the FADS without orifices.}

In this research, we present a representation scheme for solving spatial layout problems that is simple to implement as well as extend. The mechanisms for evaluation and mutation are defined and also shown to be extendable. Ultimately, the topic explored here is the ways in which ED and computation can enhance our design thinking and how computers can provide the background to new design processes and workflows.}

abstract = {Abstract A passenger car high-speed direct-injection diesel engine operating at low-load conditions in the modulated kinetic combustion mode was optimized using a multi-dimensional computational fluid dynamics code and a multi-objective genetic algorithm. Spray targeting, piston bowl geometry, and swirl ratio were optimized. Since the combustion is mainly kinetics controlled, detailed chemistry was considered through a recently developed adaptive multi-grid chemistry (AMC) model. The numerical results from the AMC model, including the pressure and pollutant emissions, were first validated on the baseline engine for a parametric sweep by comparison with the results from the standard KIVA—CHEMKIN model. The AMC model was found to give consistent results with the KIVA—CHEMKIN model, with a computational cost that is less than half that of the KIVA—CHEMKIN model. Optimal designs from the optimization were also validated using the full KIVA—CHEMKIN model and were found to reduce the fuel consumption and/or pollutant emissions. Start-of-injection timing was found to be the primary parameter influencing the fuel consumption and soot emissions for the engine operating in the low-load condition. Later injection benefits the fuel consumption and soot reduction. However, further retardation of the injection timing leads to reduced combustion efficiency and even misfire, and results in higher unburned hydrocarbon emissions. Different piston bowl shapes have different responses to bulk flow motions and the resulting geometry-generated turbulence will affect soot formation and oxidation.}

abstract = {The aim of the present work is to predict the fatigue life of a friction stir welded (FSW) joint in the 2024-T351 aluminum alloy using the finite element method in the framework of Fracture Analysis Code for Two Dimensions (FRANC2D/L). The simulation is conducted using linear elastic fracture mechanics based on Paris’ model, and the maximum tensile stress and displacement correlation methods are applied to calculate the crack direction and stress intensity factor, respectively. Several strategies are applied in order to predict the crack propagations through various welded zones regarding the corresponding parameters and Paris constants for each zone. The entire crack growth process is investigated step by step through all of the FSW zones, and the fatigue lifetimes of the FSW joint under various loading conditions are predicted by implementing the same procedure. The numerical results are validated with experimental and analytical work.}

abstract = {This is a review of research on thinking aloud in reading comprehension that considers thinking aloud as a method of inquiry, a mode of instruction, and a means for encouraging social interaction. As a method of inquiry, the analysis of verbal reports provided by readers thinking aloud revealed the flexible and goal-directed processing of expert readers. As a mode of instruction, thinking aloud was first employed by teachers who modeled their processing during reading, making overt the strategies they were using to comprehend text. Subsequently, instructional approaches were developed to engage students themselves in thinking aloud. Such endeavors revealed facilitation effects on text understanding. Current efforts to engage students in constructing meaning from text in collaborative discussions seem to indicate a new direction for thinking aloud research, one in which social interaction assumes increased importance.}

abstract = {H- and T-shaped cross sections are known to be susceptible to rotational single-degree-of-freedom aerodynamic instabilities. Here, such self-excited aerodynamic response of a T-shaped cantilever structure is used to extract energy, which is then converted into electric power through an electromagnetic transducer. The complex fluid–structure interaction between the cantilever harvester and wind flow is analyzed numerically and experimentally. To study the dynamic response of the cantilever and estimate the power output from the harvester, numerical simulations based on the vortex particle method are performed to determine the aerodynamic damping of the harvester section and to analyze the stability behavior of the section. The estimated aerodynamic damping parameter together with the mechanical and electrical damping parameters in the harvester are used to find the critical wind speed of flutter onset as well as the optimum load resistance. Wind tunnel experiments are conducted to validate the simulation results.}

abstract = {Twenty-two substituted 7-hydroxycoumarins were studied by negative ion electrospray ionization collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectrometry. Fragmentation pathways were also investigated by computation method using the B3LYP density functional theory. In general, the most important fragmentations of the 7-hydroxycoumarin [M – H]− ions were the elimination of CO2 and CO which agreed with the calculated energies of the proposed fragmentation reactions. In most cases, methyl group elimination was also favorable. Methyl group elimination occurred in three different ways, the most interesting being hydrogen rearrangement from a neighboring alkyl group to a ring carbon, which led to a benzyl radical formation. In some cases, CH2CO elimination was observed as well. Isomeric compounds gave rise to different CID spectra.}

abstract = {As a method for bonding powdered materials, sintering has distinct advantages, such as the production of a near final-shape of the desired product, without the need for significant post-processing. However, sintering has certain deficiencies, such as incomplete or weak bonding. Research is ongoing to improve the process. One approach to improve sintering processes of powdered materials is via electrically enhanced bonding, whereby electricity is pumped through the material, while it is compressed in a press, in order to induce Joule-heating. This paper develops a computationally based model for the direct simulation of electrically enhanced sintering of powdered materials using particle-based methods. The overall approach is to construct three coupled sub-models which primarily involve: (a) particle-to-particle mechanical contact, (b) particle-to-particle thermal exchange and (c) particle-to-particle electrical current flow. These physical processes are strongly coupled, since the dynamics dictates which particles are in contact and the contacts determine the electrical flow. The flow of electricity controls the Joule-heating and the induced thermal fields, which soften the material, leading to enhanced particle binding. The strong multiphysics-coupled sub-models are solved iteratively within each time-step using a recursive staggering scheme, which employs temporal adaptivity to control the error. If the process does not converge (to within an error tolerance) within a preset number of iterations, the time-step is adapted (reduced) by utilizing an estimate of the spectral radius of the coupled system. The modular approach allows for easy replacement of submodels, if needed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the model and numerical solution scheme.}
