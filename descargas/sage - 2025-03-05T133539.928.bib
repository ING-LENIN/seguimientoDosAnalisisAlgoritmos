abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the theoretical foundation and implementation of two alternative instructional courses that aimed to support the development of elementary school students’ early algebraic thinking. Both courses approached three basic algebra content strands: generalized arithmetic, functional thinking and modelling languages. The courses differed according to the characteristics of the tasks that were used. The first course involved ‘pure mathematical guided investigations’ emphasizing scaffolding steps in pure mathematics contexts. The second course focused on ‘applied open explorations’ underlining more open questions in applied everyday contexts. The courses were compared in respect to students’ learning outcomes. The findings, yielded from the analysis of pre-test and post-test data, indicated that the second course had better learning outcomes compared to the first.}

abstract = {Locomotive sanders are used to optimize the traction between the train wheels and the railhead by spraying sand into the interface. It has been previously shown that a large fraction of sand sprayed by the sanders does not make it through the wheel–rail nip, leading to sand wastage and thereby increasing the cost and refilling effort. In this study, pneumatic conveying of sand through the wheel–rail nip is numerically modeled through coupled computational fluid dynamics and discrete element method simulations. The gas phase, discrete phase, and coupled two-phase flows are separately validated against the literature, and the parameters affecting the deposition of sand into the nip are analyzed to determine their impact on sander efficiency. The aerodynamics associated with the particle-laden jet play a critical role in optimizing the amount of sand going through the wheel–rail interface, with the particle velocities being directly correlated with the sander efficiency. Particle–geometry interactions (e.g. particle bouncing) are found to have a negligible effect on the deposition. In the absence of crosswinds, it is recommended to employ particles with a smaller Stokes number to enhance the sander efficiency. A larger airflow rate through the nozzle is also recommended. Crosswinds strongly and adversely affect sander efficiency. The effects of crosswinds can be mitigated by reducing the nip–nozzle distance and using coarser particles.}

abstract = {Carbon nanotube polymer composites exhibit piezoresistivity that can be utilized for flexible strain sensors. Piezoresistive modeling is critical for improving sensor performance, but remains a challenging subject due to the complex CNT network microstructure and the various effects occurring at both the micro and nano scales. Tunneling conduction between CNTs is the primary mechanism underlying piezoresistivity in carbon nanotube polymer composites. Existing models have employed a myriad of assumptions on the CNT network kinematics and the tunneling conduction behavior, but their physical basis and effects have not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, a detailed evaluation on these modeling assumptions is presented with the goal of establishing an approach without ad hoc assumptions and improved predictive accuracy. A computational model that is capable of tracking the history of tunneling separation of each CNT junction is first constructed. The effects of CNT extensibility, tunneling cross-section, conduction channels are studied via statistical analysis of the tunneling conduction and comparison of computed piezoresistive response. It is found that CNT inextensibility leads to higher predicted piezoresistivity, the tunneling cross-section area in the Simmons approximation is a highly influential parameter, and the Landauer formula provides a more physically based approach that accounts for CNT properties.}

abstract = {Contemporary artificial intelligence and algorithmic processes address deep-seated existential challenges and modes of desire. In so doing, they produce computational systems of imagination, an “algorithmic as if” that enables the expression, transformation, and seeming overcoming of existential limitations via technological means. This article elaborates the character of the “algorithmic as if” by focusing on Deep Nostalgia, an online tool that turns personal photographs of the deceased into looped animations which smile, blink, and move, promising to overcome mortality by technologically “resurrecting the dead.” Performing a close-reading of Deep Nostalgia’s technological processes and the public discourse around its 2021 launch, the article highlights its combination of computational learning, forms of visual representation (photography, video, and animation), and distinctive realignments of temporal experience. Together, these frame the “algorithmic as if” as a magical and affective space for realizing impossible longings that are also reflexive encounters with the “limit-situation” of human mortality.}

abstract = {In recent years, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) techniques have attracted enormous interest in the throughflow calculations, and one of the major concerns in the CFD-based throughflow method is the modeling of blade forces. In this article, a viscous blade force model in the CFD-based throughflow program was proposed to account for the loss generation. The throughflow code is based on the axisymmetric Navier–Stokes equations. The inviscid blade force is determined by calculating a pressure difference between the pressure and suction surfaces, and the viscous blade force is related to the local kinetic energy through a skin friction coefficient. The viscous blade force model was validated by a linear controlled diffusion airfoil cascade, and the results showed that it can correctly introduce the loss into the CFD-based throughflow model. Then, the code was applied to calculate the transonic NASA rotor 67, and the calculated results were in good agreement with the measured results, which showed that the calculated shock losses reduce the dependence of the throughflow calculation on the empirical correlation. Last, the 3.5-stage compressor P&W3S1 at 85%, 100%, and 105% of the design speed was performed to demonstrate the reliability of the viscous blade force model in a multistage environment. The results showed that the CFD-based throughflow method can easily predict the spanwise mixing due to the inclusion of the turbulence model, and predicted results were in acceptable agreement with the experimental results. In a word, the proposed viscous blade force model and CFD-based throughflow model can achieve the throughflow analysis with an acceptable level of accuracy and a little time-consuming.}

abstract = {One advantage of highly automated vehicles is drivers can use commute time for non-driving tasks, such as work-related tasks. The potential for an auto-mobile office—a space where drivers work in automated vehicles—is a complex yet underexplored idea. This paper begins to define a design space of the auto- mobile office in SAE Level 3 automated vehicles by integrating the affinity diagram (AD) with a computational representation of the abstraction hierarchy (AH). The AD uses a bottom-up approach where researchers starting with individual findings aggregate and abstract those into higher-level concepts. The AH uses a top-down approach where researchers start with first principles to identify means-ends links between system goals and concrete forms of the system. Using the programming language R, the means-ends links of AH can be explored statistically. This computational approach to the AH provides a systematic means to define the design space of the auto-mobile office.}

abstract = {Documents have been increasingly recognised as important objects of investigation in Science and Technology Studies (STS); however, so far, much less attention has been given to the study of documents produced in Digital Humanities. The author proposes therefore to use the method of the ‘STS of documents’ and analyse Feasibility documents that aim to assess technical and design requirements based on research questions and to organise a project workflow. Drawing on the ethnography of King’s Digital Lab, the article investigates Feasibility documents produced by the lab within the Agile-based Software Development Lifecycle framework. The article aims to show that Feasibility documents (1) inform ethnographic work about lab workflow and management and in doing so, are able to capture the interconnectedness of work layers and practices; (2) enable an empirical analysis of digital research projects and the process of translation from research questions, to methods, to technical solutions; (3) are critical structuring objects that structure the research process and relationships between involved actors and are structured by local institutional strategies and decisions. The author conducts a ‘feasibility analysis’ that reveals the project management and development stages: the analytical process (the translation of research questions into technical solutions); the production process (the move from technical and design practices to research answers) and the infrastructure and management process (project workflow and sustainability solutions). Drawing on Agre’s critical technical practice and Digital Humanities’ theories of critical production, the article seeks to shift attention from end-product digital artefacts towards the complex process of their creation, which can unpack a range of social, technological and management issues. In doing so, it also aims to provide a methodological framework for the analysis of documents produced in Digital Humanities that have the potential to unearth new questions about the socio-technical nature of digital production.}
