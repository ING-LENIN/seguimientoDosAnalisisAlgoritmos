abstract = {A composite material (CM) of periodic structure with the peristatic properties of constituents, as proposed by Silling, is analyzed by a generalization of the classical locally elastic computational homogenization to its peristatic counterpart. New volumetric periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) are introduced at the interaction boundary of a representative unit cell (UC). A generalization of the Hill’s equality to peristatic composites is proved. The general results establishing the links between the effective moduli and the corresponding mechanical influence functions are obtained. The discretization of the equilibrium equation acts as a macro-to-micro transition of the deformation-driven type, where the overall deformation is controlled. Determination of the microstructural displacements allows one to estimate the peristatic traction at the geometrical UC’s boundary, which is exploited for estimation of the macroscopic stresses and the effective moduli. The proposed approach is demonstrated computationally through one-dimensional examples.}

abstract = {Why do some individuals pick up arms as opposed to others who live under the same conditions? Environmental and group theories fail to differentiate between these individuals. In response, we apply the cognitive mapping approach and model violence as decisions based on chains of beliefs about various types of factors, including state aggression, access to violent groups, religion, and personal characteristics. Based on a double-paired comparison, data are constructed from ethnographic interviews with Muslim and non-Muslim individuals engaging in violent and nonviolent activity in authoritarian and democratic states—Egypt and Germany. The analysis develops a computational model formalizing the cognitive maps into Bayesian networks. In 477,604 runs, the model (1) identifies the beliefs connected to decisions, (2) traces inference chains antecedent to decisions, and (3) explores counterfactuals. This suggests that both violent and nonviolent activities are responses to state aggression, and not to Islam, group access, or personal characteristics.}

abstract = {We address the problem of DOA estimation in positioning of nodes in wireless sensor networks. The Stochastic Maximum Likelihood (SML) algorithm is adopted in this paper. The SML algorithm is well-known for its high resolution of DOA estimation. However, its computational complexity is very high because multidimensional nonlinear optimization problem is usually involved. To reduce the computational complexity of SML estimation, we do the following work. (1) We point out the problems of conventional SML criterion and explain why and how these problems happen. (2) A local AM search method is proposed which could be used to find the local solution near/around the initial value. (3) We propose an algorithm which uses the local AM search method together with the estimation of DML or MUSIC as initial value to find the solution of SML. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. In particular, the algorithm which uses the local AM method and estimation of MUSIC as initial value has much higher resolution and comparable computational complexity to MUSIC.}

abstract = {Clutter in tactical situation displays (TSD) is a persistent problem that affects pilots’ performance. Decluttering methods such as dimming, dotting, small-sizing and removal have been used in several display types to reduce clutter. This study aims to investigate the effects of different decluttering methods applied in TSD on pilots’ visual search performance. It also aims to uncover the basic psychophysical processes underlying the pilots’ visual search behavior through computational modeling. Data from fifteen Air-Force pilots showed that accuracy is higher and response time is faster when the TSD is decluttered, regardless of the technique. However, when the data was fitted into the hierarchical drift-diffusion model, it was revealed that among the techniques tested, dimming yielded the best search performance based on the model parameters. This study suggests that analyzing behavioral data through computational modeling may lead to better insights that are more practical and applicable in solving the issues in visual search in TSDs.}

abstract = {The co-optimization of in-cylinder combustion and after-treatment technology has become a major aspect in engine design and development, with the goal of meeting the increasingly restrictive emission regulations in the transportation industry. Selective Catalytic Reduction is a robust technology to control the emission of NOx, and the injection of urea in water solution is the exhaust tailpipe is a key aspect of its operation. The proposed work uses high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics to characterize the atomization dynamics of the liquid jet in relevant cross-flow conditions. The study focuses on a commercial low-pressure (9 bar) pressure-swirl injector which is characterized in its internal geometry through high-resolution X-ray micro-computational tomography. The internal two-phase flow has been modeled according to the volume-of-fluid approach in a large eddy simulation framework and validated against near-nozzle X-ray radiography measurement. Moreover, characterizing the breakup dynamics for the swirling hollow cone formation, and assessing the influence of the cross-flow in the breakup dynamics was completed. The results have been reported proposing Re-Oh maps and probability density functions of the spray kinematics. Higher cross-flow momentum generates an increase in the jet intact length and a reduction of the liquid droplet diameters. The axial momentum of the jet is affected by the cross-flow already in the near-nozzle region, determining a relevant deviation of the spray velocities. This work aims to inform the initialization of Eulerian-Lagrangian spray models through the assignment of droplet kinematics and static one-way coupling between volume-of-fluid results and Lagrangian spray parcels, to be used for system-size domain simulations.}

abstract = {Film cooling effectiveness has been studied by using a computational approach based on solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. A wind tunnel test configuration is considered with a total of four cooling hole geometries as a cylindrical hole, a cylindrical hole with an upstream wedge (called ‘ramp’ thereafter), a shaped diffuser, and a double console slot. In all cases, the hole centreline has an inclination angle of 35° against the mainstream airflow and the blowing ratio is unity. Choosing the cylindrical model as a baseline, simulations have been carried out for grid convergence and turbulence model influence studies. Results are compared with available experimental data and other numerical predictions and good agreement has been achieved. Further computations continue with three remaining geometries, using the baseline flow conditions and configuration. Comparing to the results from the baseline model, it was found that the centreline adiabatic cooling effectiveness has shown incremental increases for the ‘ramp’ model, while results from the console slot model and the shape diffuser model have exhibited significant improvements by a factor of 1.5 and 2, respectively. The reason for such a step change in cooling effectiveness is mainly due to the weakening of the vortex structures in the vicinity of the hole exit, thus significantly reducing the entrainment of surrounding ‘hot’ fluids.}
