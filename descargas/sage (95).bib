abstract = {This article discusses interaction between multimodal representations of architectural design knowledge, particularly focusing on relating explicit and implicit types of information. The aim of the presented research is to develop a computational environment that combines several modes of representation, including and integrating different forms of architectural design knowledge. Development of an interactive digital-models library and ontological model of architectural design factors are discussed, which are complementary in nature. In a time when BIM software is seen as embodiment of domain knowledge and the future medium of architectural design, this paper presents an interaction between ontological representation of architectural design knowledge and its embodiment in interactive models, thus focusing on the process of design and design space exploration. In the digital environments that we propose, representation of different formats of knowledge, such as visual, linguistic or numeric, are integrated with relational and procedural information, design rules, and characteristics. Interactive search and query based on contextual constraints, and parametric variation of the model based on the information received from ontology are the underlying drivers for design exploration and development.}

abstract = {Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education initiatives have placed pressure on teachers to bring technology tools into classroom, including three-dimensional (3D) printing. Yet, little research has examined what specific math skills are required for 3D printing technology. This article describes a follow-up analysis of findings from a quasi-experimental study that tested feasibility of 3D geometry instruction, Anchored Instruction with Technology Applications (AITA), designed to help students visualize and construct 3D models based on Enhanced Anchored Instruction. Although we found that AITA improved math outcomes of students with math learning disabilities (MLD) in the previous analysis, we only used composite scores encompassing a variety of math and spatial tasks. In this study, we employed item response theory and differential item functioning to examine the impacts of MLD on students’ spatial thinking skills, understand the types of items to assess the intended skills in a valid way, and provide a detailed information of whether student ability and MLD status have caused different results to assess students’ spatial thinking skills. Results showed that students with MLD struggle to learn spatial thinking skills, and AITA was a significant positive indicator to improve spatial thinking skills for both students with and without MLD.}

Roughly speaking, a partial word is a word in which some positions are unspecified and a partial word automaton is a finite automaton that accepts a partial word language—here the unspecified positions in the word are represented by a “hole” symbol ⋄. A partial word language L′ can be transformed into an ordinary language L by using a ⋄-substitution. In particular, we investigate the complexity of the compression or minimization problem for partial word automata, which is known to be NP-hard. We improve on the previously known complexity on this problem, by showing PSPACE-completeness. In fact, it turns out that almost all problems related to partial word automata, such as, e.g., equivalence and universality, are already PSPACE-complete. Moreover, we also study these problems under the further restriction that the involved automata accept only finite languages. In this case, the complexities of the studied problems drop from PSPACE-completeness down to coNP-hardness and containment in ∑2P depending on the problem investigated.}

abstract = {Accumulation of soot particles on the wall of a constricted pipe, through which JP4 liquid jet fuel flows, is investigated numerically, using a pipe with a bump on its wall. The effects of particle size, particle-to-fluid density ratio and carrier fluid flow Reynolds number, on particle accumulation, are investigated. When the particles’ size is relatively large, with particle-to-fluid density ratio greater than unity, and at relatively large Re number, the largest accumulation of particles occurs near the bump’s front wall where those particles are blocked by the protruding bump and are too massive to be carried away by the nearwall, low momentum carrier fluid. Conversely, when either the particles’ size or the carrier fluid Re number is relatively small, or the density ratio is less than unity, the largest accumulation of particles occurs in one of three regions: on the bump’s rear wall, near the center of the recirculation eddy, or at the flow detachment point. Particle-accumulation ratio on the bump’s wall decreases monotonically as the particle size decreases (with the mass concentration of particles at the pipe inlet held fixed).}

abstract = {Hand sanitization by healthcare staff remains one of the most effective ways for controlling infection in healthcare settings. However, predicting faithful adherence to Hand Hygiene Compliance (HHC) is difficult in complex environments such as inpatient hospital settings. The main challenge is understanding how different components of human and built systems interact to achieve specific goals such as HHC at the critical moments of care delivery. The aim of this explorative study was to evaluate how Human Factors derived visual salience cues and proximity-compatibility principles might be used in the design of healthcare spaces to support nurse moments of HHC through increased perceived behavioral control and intention. The investigative team used a Collaborative Computational Scenario Planning (CCSP) Model approach to determine the integrative effects of reinforcing and detracting operational and environmental factors on discrete moments of HHC behavior. Supervised Machine Learning analysis was conducted on data collected by a large academic medical center that included HHC observance in clinical staff spanning from 2017 to 2021 in two inpatient hospital units. The probabilistic outcomes of unit based HHC observance likelihood were used to compute Fuzzy Cognitive Model Edge Probabilities between Hand Hygiene (HH) cues and detected HHC at key moments. Hospital infection control experts were then engaged to identify the weight of various reinforcing and detracting operational and environmental factors contributing to HHC observance. Combining the quantitative and qualitative methods, allowed the team to then develop integrative CCSP models which facilitated predictive insight into the development of targeted environmental improvements that might contribute to HHC control and intention to support safer patient care.}

Air levels of volatile components (VCs) arising from oil spills under some hypothetical scenarios have been studied using a computational model. The computational results indicate that overexposure to benzene may exist under general conditions. A table summarizing the exposure risks under various conditions is presented which may be useful in exposure risk analysis during oil spill response. The exposure to other volatile hydrocarbon components is negligible. Exposure to sulphur components occurs, but the duration is very short.}
