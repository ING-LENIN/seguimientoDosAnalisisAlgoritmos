abstract = {This paper proposes CHROMUBE. It is a methodology for the creation of computational models of human behavior. That kind of simulated model has a number of applications in the smart environments and ubiquitous computing domains. For example, an interesting application is using these models for testing services and applications in smart environments (e.g. a fall detection service for elders living independently in their own house, based on sensors deployed at home). The methodology uses techniques from Chronobiology (i.e. actograms, plexograms and cyrcadian rhythms detection) to analyze real data about the target subject’s behavior. The analysis is intended to create a simulation model of the human starting from the result of such analysis. The effectiveness of the procedure is demonstrated with a running example: a real system that monitors elderly people at home. The application of CHROMUBE in such context had an influence on the pilot experience used to test the system. Thanks to CHROMUBE, its duration was reduced and the pilot more focused on the typical reliability and dependability aspects of a system that must work 24 × 7.}

With ByrdBot, listeners can compare simulated soundscapes of 1970, 2017, and 2065 to immediately, and viscerally, experience decades of past or projected future environmental change. The communication tactic of ByrdBot—what we call emergent sonification—is discussed as one that capitalizes on computational media to facilitate attunement to nonhuman voices and, subsequently, to offer an affective grasping of the impacts of such phenomena as habitat destruction and climate change on wildlife displacement and loss.}

abstract = {The performance of air bearing is highly influenced by the geometrical parameters of its restrictor. This study aims to maximize the load-carrying capacity and stiffness of air bearing, and minimize its volume flow rate by optimizing the geometrical parameters of restrictor. To facilitate the calculation of air bearing performance, a parametric computational fluid dynamics model is developed. Then, it is combined with multiobjective optimization genetic algorithm to search the Pareto optimal solutions. Furthermore, as a case study, the optimal design of an annular thrust air bearing is implemented. The stiffness of air bearing is improved 38.5%, the load-carrying capacity is improved 33.9%, and the volume flow rate is declined 19.6%, which are finally validated by experiments. It proves the reliability of proposed parametric computational fluid dynamics model and genetic optimization algorithm.}

abstract = {A robust approach to computational kinematics intended to cope with algorithmic singularities is introduced in this article. The approach is based on the reduction of the original system of equations to a subsystem of bivariate equations, as opposed to the multivariate polynomial reduction leading to the characteristic univariate polynomial. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated for the exact function-generation synthesis of planar, spherical, and spatial four-bar linkages. Some numerical examples are provided for the case of the spherical four-bar function generator with six precision points to show the benefits of the proposed method with respect to methods reported in the literature.}

abstract = {The emergent reflexive process, by which researchers in a computational humanities project work towards a viable organizational modality for interdisciplinary collaboration, is analyzed. Using the metaphor of decomposition, successful collaboration between computer scientists and humanities scholars can be seen to require a reflexive scrutiny — a decomposition — of the disciplinary research processes that are involved, thus allowing crucial differences with respect to typical ways of posing research questions, the role of data, and the rhythm of the research process to be highlighted. It is argued that the currently popular expectation towards data as a self-identical organizational unit tends to downplay the role of decomposition as practice and process. A European cyberinfrastructure initiative that tries to respect the specificities of scholarly practice in the humanities is critically assessed, reflecting in particular on the inherent tension between ‘mutual shaping’ of digital tools and their users on the one hand, and the policy interest in efficient, functionalist design principles on the other.}

Some scholars, however, have argued that violence is often the result of local cleavages and feuds, many of which may be unrelated to the conflict’s master cleavage.

Using a computational model, this paper studies an alliance mechanism proposed by Kalyvas (2006, The Logic of Violence in Civil War, Cambridge University Press), where macro-actors support local ones that fight on their behalf. While these alliances create a principal–agent problem, the model shows that they can raise the overall severity of the conflict and serve the interests of the macro-actor.

Alliances can increase the level of violence perpetrated in the interest of the macro-actor, but only if (a) the latter supports agents that have in the past fought along the master cleavage and if (b) this happens in rural areas. This emphasizes again the importance of the rural dimension in the study of civil war.}

abstract = {Increasing demands for high-performance screw pumps in oil and gas as well as other applications require deep understanding of the fluid flow field inside the machine. Important effects on the performance such as dynamic losses, influence of the leakage gaps and presence and extent of cavitation are difficult to observe by experiments. However, it is possible to study such effects using well-validated computational fluid dynamics models. The novel-structured numerical mesh consisting of a single-computational domain for moving screw pump rotors was developed to allow three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation of such machine possible. Based on finite volume method, the instantaneous mass flow rates, rotor torque, local pressure field, velocity field and other performance indicators including the indicated power were predicted. A calculation model for the bearing friction losses was introduced to account for mechanical losses. The geometry of the inlet and outlet passages and piping system are taken into consideration to evaluate their influences on the pressure distribution and shaft power. The paper also shows the influence of rotor clearances on the pump performance. The computational fluid dynamics model was validated by comparing the numerical results with the measured performance obtained in the experimental test rig through the comprehensive experiment performed for a set of discharge pressures and rotational speeds. Validation includes comparison of mass flow rates, shaft power and efficiency under variety of speeds and discharge pressure. It has been found that the predicted results match well with the measurements. The results also showed that the radial clearances have larger influence on the mass flow rate than the interlobe clearance. The correct design of the flow passages within the screw pump plays significant role in minimizing required power consumption. The analysis presented in this paper contributes to better understanding of the working process inside the screw pump and offers a good reference to improve design and optimize such machines in terms of clearance selection, shape of the ports, piping system, etc. In future, this model will be used for analysis of cavitating flows and determining performance of other multiphase screw pumps.}

abstract = {Molecular biology focuses on genes and their interactions at the transcription, regulation and protein level. Finding genes that cause certain behaviors can make therapeutic interventions more effective. Although biological tools can extract the genes and perform some analyses, without the help of computational methods, deep insight of the genetic function and its effects will not occur. On the other hand, complex systems can be modeled by networks, introducing the main data as nodes and the links in-between as the transactions occurring within the network. Gene regulatory networks are examples that are modeled and analyzed in order to gain insight of their exact functions. Since a cell’s specific functionality is greatly determined by the genes it expresses, translation or the act of converting mRNA to proteins is highly regulated by the control network that directs cellular activities. This paper briefly reviews the most important computational methods for analyzing, modeling and controlling the gene regulatory networks.}

abstract = {Robotics education has received widespread attention in K-12 education. Studies have pointed out that in robotics courses, learners face challenges in learning abstract content, such as constructing a robot with a good structure and writing programs to drive a robot to complete specific learning tasks. The present study proposed the embodied learning-based computer programming approach and applied it to the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 robotics course. To evaluate its effectiveness, a quasi-experiment was conducted in one public primary school to explore its effects on students’ learning achievement, learning motivation, learning attitudes, learning engagement, and cognitive load. The experimental group (40 students) adopted the embodied learning-based computer programming approach, while the control group (40 students) adopted the conventional computer programming approach. The results showed that the experimental group had significantly better learning achievement in robotics than the control group, and that there was no significant difference in the cognitive load of the two groups. In terms of learning motivation, although both groups showed improvement, the experimental group had higher intrinsic learning motivation. In addition, the experimental group outperformed the control group with regard to learning attitudes and learning engagement (including cognitive, behavioral, and emotional engagement). Accordingly, this study could contribute to future research for developing more effective robotics teaching approaches and computer programming activity design.}
