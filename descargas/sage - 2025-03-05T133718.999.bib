N2 - There are particular similarities in how machines learn about the nature of their environment, and how humans learn to process visual stimuli. Machine Learning (ML), more specifically Deep Neural network algorithms rely on expansive image databases and various training methods (supervised, unsupervised) to “make sense” out of the content of an image. Take for example how students of architecture learn to differentiate various architectural styles. Whether this be to differentiate between Gothic, Baroque or Modern Architecture, students are exposed to hundreds, or even thousands of images of the respective styles, while being trained by faculty to be able to differentiate between those styles. A reversal of the process, striving to produce imagery, instead of reading it and understanding its content, allows machine vision techniques to be utilized as a design methodology that profoundly interrogates aspects of agency and authorship in the presence of Artificial Intelligence in architecture design. This notion forms part of a larger conversation on the nature of human ingenuity operating within a posthuman design ecology. The inherent ability of Neural Networks to process large databases opens up the opportunity to sift through the enormous repositories of imagery generated by the architecture discipline through the ages in order to find novel and bespoke solutions to architectural problems. This article strives to demystify the romantic idea of individual artistic design choices in architecture by providing a glimpse under the hood of the inner workings of Neural Network processes, and thus the extent of their ability to inform architectural design. The approach takes cues from the language and methods employed by experts in Deep Learning such as Hallucinations, Dreaming, Style Transfer and Vision. The presented approach is the base for an in-depth exploration of its meaning as a cultural technique within the discipline. Culture in the extent of this article pertains to ideas such as the differentiation between symbolic and material cultures, in which symbols are defined as the common denominator of a specific group of people.1 The understanding and exchange of symbolic values is inherently connected to language and code, which ultimately form the ingrained texture of any form of coded environment, including the coded structure of Neural Networks. A first proof of concept project was devised by the authors in the form of the Robot Garden. What makes the Robot Garden a distinctively novel project is the motion from a purely two dimensional approach to designing with the aid of Neural Networks, to the exploration of 2D to 3D Neural Style Transfer methods in the design process.

N2 - With the disruptive emergence of Artificial Intelligences in the production of knowledge, new questions arise about the role that these technologies should occupy within the different spheres through which the past is represented. This article examines ChatGPT’s potential as a pedagogical tool for the development of historical thinking. For this purpose, we present the analysis of an interactive process around the historical event usually referred to as the Spanish Reconquista (711–1492). Through argumentative interventions, a dialogue is constructed in which the information provided by the AI is questioned, proving its ability to rectify and incorporate elements of historical thinking into its discourse. An ethical and multidisciplinary perspective is needed, which safeguards the responsible and beneficial use of these technologies in the construction and transmission of historical knowledge.

N2 - In this factor-analytic study of imaging and thinking, measures of vivid visual and auditory imaging loaded onto a unitary “vivid imaging” factor, on which no measures of thinking loaded. This first factor-analytic finding, like previous findings of no correlation between vivid imaging and productive thinking, is consistent with Külpe’s classic argument and Kunzendorf’s contemporary argument that visually and auditorily imaged sensations are not building blocks for “spatial” and “temporal” thinking, respectively, but are sensory representations which vivid imagers construct from their imageless thoughts. Moving beyond individual differences in vivid imaging to individual differences in imageless thinking, this factor-analytic study found, in addition, that radically different measures of styles of thought load onto a unitary “heterarchical versus hierarchical thinking” factor. These differing measures of thinking styles instructed research participants to find embedded spatial and temporal patterns, to organize two unstructured data sets into matrices or outlines, and to rank their preferences for 12 competitive events—6 events defined by “how close, “how high,” or “how far” competitors can perform on a heterarchical measure, and 6 events defined by “how well synchronized,” “how long,” or “how fast” competitors can perform on a hierarchical measure. Engineering students in this research exhibited significantly more heterarchical thinking and significantly less hierarchical thinking; management students exhibited significantly less heterarchical thinking and significantly more hierarchical thinking; and male students and female students exhibited, on average, no significant differences in their modes of thinking. Based on these findings, the authors conclude that people’s “imageless thinking” can be characterized in terms of two orthogonal modes of thinking: heterarchical thinking and hierarchical thinking.

N2 - This article proposes a Rayleigh’s quotient–based damage detection algorithm. It aims at efficiently revealing nascent structural changes on a given structure with the capability to differentiate between an actual damage and a change in operational conditions. The first three damage detection levels are targeted: existence, location, and severity. The proposed algorithm is analytically developed from the dynamics theory and the virtual energy principle. Some computational techniques are proposed for carrying out computations, including discretization, integration, derivation, and suitable optimization methods. Field implementation strategies are also considered for the purpose of online damage monitoring. In order to prove the efficiency of this strategy, one experimental and three numerical case studies were conducted. The proposed algorithm successfully detected the damage in all simulated cases and estimated the damage severity with acceptable accuracy. The conclusion is that the proposed algorithm was able to efficiently detect damage appearance in a range of structures for various damage levels and locations, and under different operational conditions.

N2 - We perform a socio-computational interrogation of the google search by image algorithm, a main component of the google search engine. We audit the algorithm by presenting it with more than 40 thousands faces of all ages and more than four races and collecting and analyzing the assigned labels with the appropriate statistical tools. We find that the algorithm reproduces white male patriarchal structures, often simplifying, stereotyping and discriminating females and non-white individuals, while providing more positive descriptions of white men. By drawing from Bourdieu’s theory of cultural reproduction, we link these results to the attitudes of the algorithm’s designers, owners, and the dataset the algorithm was trained on. We further underpin the problematic nature of the algorithm by using the ethnographic practice of studying-up: We show how the algorithm places individuals at the top of the tech industry within the socio-cultural reality that they shaped, many times creating biased representations of them. We claim that the use of social-theoretic frameworks such as the above are able to contribute to improved algorithmic accountability, algorithmic impact assessment and provide additional and more critical depth in algorithmic bias and auditing studies. Based on the analysis, we discuss the scientific and design implications and provide suggestions for alternative ways to design just socio-algorithmic systems.

N2 - The purpose of this article is to optimize the design of a pickup head that removes particles from road surface. A validated computational fluid dynamics model was proposed to evaluate the particle removal performance of the designed pickup head with different inclination angles. The gas-particle flow through the pickup head was modelled using the EulerianLagrangian approach. The realizable k model and the discrete particle model were adopted to simulate gas flow field and solid particle trajectories, respectively. The results indicate that the inclination angle of the rear edge wall and the pressure drop across the pickup head have great impact on the particle removal performance. Both the particle overall removal efficiency and the grade efficiency increase with the increment of inclination angle, and higher pressure drop can pick up more particles from the road surface, but it would induce unnecessary energy consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to design a pickup head with high removal efficiency and low pressure drop. Through simulation, the optimal angle should be 135 for the range of the inclination angle in this study, and pressure drop is about 2400Pa. Furthermore, more information can be acquired for pickup head design.

N2 - Recognizer P systems with active membranes have proven to be very efficient computing devices, being able to solve NP-complete decision problems in a polynomial time. However such solutions usually exploit many powerful features, such as electrical charges (polarizations) associated to membranes, evolution rules, communication rules, and strong or weak forms of division rules. In this paper we contribute to the study of the computational power of polarizationless recognizer P systems with active membranes. Precisely, we show that such systems are able to solve in polynomial time the NP-complete decision problem 3-SAT by using only dissolution rules and a form of strong division for non-elementary membranes, working in the maximallly parallel way.
