N2 - Recent years have seen a significant increase in the importance of environmental protection and sustainability to consumers, policy makers, and society in general. Reflecting this, most organizations are at least aware of this new agenda and wish to be seen as taking steps to improve behaviors in this regard. However, there appears to be a gap between this evolving agenda and the comparatively low level of knowledge that marketing managers actually have of the environmental impact of their own functional decisions. We suggest that this low knowledge level may be due, in part, to the marketplace focus of foundational marketing educational programs, and we attempt to show how broadening the horizons of marketing courses can help students (i.e., future managers) more deeply understand the environmental consequences of their actions. We demonstrate the use of a novel business game, based on the Life Cycle Assessment method, as the foundational cornerstone for the development of a broad understanding of the environmental impact of marketing decisions and actions for the entire life cycle of a product—from raw material extraction to ultimate disposal. The results of an empirical study show that this approach increases students’ appreciation for, and understanding of, these fundamental environmental sustainability concepts.

N2 - Multiple recent works have emphasized the contribution that nondigital game scholarship can make to the study of games and gameplay. Warhammer 40,000 is the market dominator of the nondigital tabletop wargame genre. In this article, we perform a ludological analysis of the process of preparing, or drafting, an army for a competitive Warhammer 40,000 tournament. We find that there are four interrelated categories of resources that influence this fundamentally playful process. Our results indicate that this process of preparation constitutes a core component of the appeal of Warhammer 40,000. This emphasizes the importance of understanding the diverse activities that go into gameplay that often exceed the computer game “client” or board of play. We suggest the category of engagement pastime to encapsulate these extended, ongoing elements of Warhammer 40,000’s appeal, which we define as a collection of interlinked and associated activities that serve to occupy one’s time and thoughts pleasantly.

N2 - Current research and theory indicate that college students’ scientific and statistical reasoning skills are deficient, but can be improved through instruction. Accordingly, an innovative statistics course was developed for the undergraduate education curriculum at the University of Wisconsin—Madison. The course promoted the idea “that the purpose of statistics is to organize a useful argument from quantitative evidence based on a form of principled rhetoric” (Abelson, 1995, pp. xiii). Most instruction was anchored to mentored, small-group collaborative activities that simulated complex, real-life problem solving. In conjunction with the second offering, evidence of student growth was obtained from pre- and post-course interviews designed to assess students’ ability to reason with statistical evidence from everyday sources. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses indicated that students made meaningful gains in their ability to reason statistically. Analyses also pointed to specific conceptual confusions, some related to course design. Students’ reactions Io the course were variable.

N2 - Recent calls encourage teacher education programs to examine how they address equity within educational technology coursework. This study therefore conceptualizes equity specifically related to using digital tools with multilingual learners. Drawing on a technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) framework informed by prior research on (language) teacher education and computer-assisted language learning, this study examines how preservice teachers described their knowledge base specifically related to using digital tools equitably with multilingual learners. Qualitative analysis of 17 preservice teachers’ course discussions, assignments, and interviews revealed that preservice teachers purposefully reflected on and selected digital tools to use that would support students’ language development and leverage students’ interests. They also reflected on structural inequities and advocacy related to technological implementation. This study encourages teacher educators to support preservice teachers in developing technologically savvy practices that are also linguistically responsive and humanizing by centering equity in TPACK.

N2 - This article examines the advancement of automated fact-checking in Brazil and investigates how artificial intelligence (AI) products shape publishers’ discourses and practices. First, it maps the field to identify how it has evolved throughout the years. Next, it draws on 30 official statements published by journalists and their tech partners, and seven semi-structured interviews with representatives from five websites. This article shows an emerging automation landscape in the Brazilian fact-checking venture supported by the tech industry. Nonetheless, AI has challenged fact-checkers’ authority and increased the technologists’ influence over journalism.

N2 - Neurophysiological signals are crucial intermediaries, through which brain activity can be quantitatively measured and brain mechanisms are able to be revealed. In particular, non‐invasive neurophysiological signals, such as electroencephalogram (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are welcomed and frequently utilised in various studies since these signals can be non‐invasively recorded without harming the human brain while they convey abundant information pertaining to brain activity. The recorded neurophysiological signals are analysed to mine meaningful information for the understanding of brain mechanisms or are classified to distinguish different patterns (e.g., different cognitive states, brain diseases versus healthy controls). To date, remarkable progress has been made in both the analysis and classification of neurophysiological signals, but scholars are not feeling complacent. Consistent effort ought to be paid to advance the research of analysis and classification based on neurophysiological signals. In this paper, I express my thoughts regarding promising future directions in neurophysiological signal analysis and classification based on current developments and accomplishments. I will elucidate the thoughts after brief summaries of relevant backgrounds, accomplishments, and tendencies. According to my personal selection and preference, I mainly focus on brain connectivity, multidimensional array (tensor), multi‐modality, multiple task classification, deep learning, big data, and naturalistic experiment. Hopefully, my thoughts could give a little help to inspire new ideas and contribute to the research of the analysis and classification of neurophysiological signals in some way.
