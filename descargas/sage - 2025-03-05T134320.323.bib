N2 - In the fields of architecture and urban design, there has always been a delay in the impact of industrial revolution technologies, and in the case of less industrialised countries, the delay has been even bigger. This article starts with a review of the history of computer-aided architectural design in Brazil and then describes the state of the field in some Latin American countries. Finally, we discuss the ‘ideal computer curriculum’ for architects in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.

N2 - One feature that characterizes the organization and delivery of health care is its inherent complexity. All too often, with so much information and so many activities involved, it is difficult for decision-makers to determine in an objective fashion an appropriate course of action. It would appear that a holistic rather than a reductionist approach would be advantageous. The aim of this paper is to review how formal systems thinking can aid decision-making in complex situations. Consideration is given as to how the use of a number of systems modelling methodologies can help in gaining an understanding of a complex decision situation. This in turn can enhance the possibility of a decision being made in a more rational, explicit and transparent fashion. The arguments and approaches are illustrated using examples taken from the public health arena.

N2 - With the continuous development of physical education technology, more modern technologies and diversified teaching concepts are being introduced into football teaching. In response to the issue of interactive football teaching puzzle games, this study designs an interactive technology that integrates Virtual Reality. A technical framework containing multiple information processing modules is constructed, and the Two Stream algorithm is used as the main body of the network framework. Action information collection and analysis are utilized to generate interactive instructions. In the analysis of training speed, the loss value of the research method decreased rapidly and reached its lowest value at the 58th iteration; in the cache data generation test, the research method did not exceed 376Mb of cache data at the 12th minute of operation. When analyzing the accuracy of interactive action recognition, the research method achieved the highest accuracy of around 0.87 in open outdoor and indoor scenes when the action duration reached 1500 ms. The research method has higher interaction quality and efficiency, which can provide technical support for information-based physical education teaching and game interaction, and provide more diversified technical means for football teaching.

N2 - Comminution and classification are the two major unit operations involved in the processing of pure minerals from its ore rocks. In the current paper, an assessment is made on different numerical models used for the prediction of fluid and solid flow properties in tumbling mill, hydrocyclone and dense medium cyclone (DMC). A detailed discussion on the selection of suitable turbulence and multiphase models for the accurate prediction of flow field in hydrocyclone is made by comparing the predictions among and against experimental data. The additional requirements for accurate performance predictions at high feed solid content is elaborated. The drawbacks of DPM model and the usage of CFD-DEM coupling technique to predict the coal partition curve in DMC’s has been elucidated. The discrepancies between DEM, CFD, one way and two way coupled CFD-DEM predicted mean flow field and particle dynamics against experimental measurements in tumbling mills also made in detail.

N2 - In elasticity, microstructure-related deviations may be modeled by strain gradient elasticity. For so-called metamaterials, different implementations are possible for solving strain gradient elasticity problems numerically. Analytical solutions of simple problems are used to verify the numerical approach. We demonstrate such a case in a two-dimensional continuum as a benchmark case for computations. As strain gradient enforces higher regularity conditions in displacements, in the finite element method (FEM), the use of standard elements is often seen as inadequate. For such piecewise or elementwise continuous elements, we examine a possible remedy to correctly simulate strain gradient elasticity problems by implementing two techniques. First, we enforce continuity of displacement gradient across elements; second, we employ a mixed finite element method where displacement and its gradient are solved both as unknowns. The results show the pros and cons of each numerical technique. All methods converge monotonically, but the mixed method is more reliable than the other one.

N2 - This paper addresses a dynamic vehicle routing problem related to courier mail services with explicit consideration of multiple objectives. This problem is modeled as a dynamic traveling repairman problem with time windows, and with three objectives considered: maximization of the number of serviced customers, minimization of customer waiting, and minimization of total travel time. A solution (simulation) framework, extending techniques developed for single-objective dynamic routing problems in the literature, is proposed to tackle this multiobjective problem. An efficient chained local search heuristic is embedded in this solution framework to solve the underlying static problem, the traveling salesman problem with time windows. Comprehensive simulation experiments conducted on data sets derived from benchmark problems show that the proposed algorithmic approach is able to provide high-quality solutions with limited computing effort. These experiments also indicate that the multiobjective model proposed in this study can offer much more attractive solutions to decision makers than single-objective models.
