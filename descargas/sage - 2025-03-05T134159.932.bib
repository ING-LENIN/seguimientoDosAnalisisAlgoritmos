N2 - There are two conflicting views about the nature of thought: it is invariably rational or invariably irrational. Bartlett argued that thinking is a high level skill, and this idea suggests an obvious third possibility: thought is sometimes rational and sometimes irrational. This view is defended in the present paper, which argues that the doctrine of logical infallibility is either falsified by the results of some experiments on syllogistic reasoning or else empirically vacuous. There is no need to postulate a mental logic of the sort that Piaget and others have proposed. The rapid implicit inferences of daily life depend on the ability to interpret sentences by constructing mental models of the states of affairs that they describe. Deliberate deductions depend on the further ability to search for alternative models that violate putative conclusions. All that you need to know to assess validity is the fundamental semantic principle of deduction: an inference is valid if, and only if, its conclusion is true in every situation in which its premises are true and there is no way of interpreting the premises so as to render the conclusion false. This principle guides the construction of all logics though it is not explicitly stated in any of them. The paper concludes by examining the ways in which people differ in their ability to reason, the practical need to improve this ability, and some of the pedagogical implications of the present studies.

N2 - With emergent subspecialties like data journalism bringing new skillsets and job roles, professionals and journalism educators find it difficult to imbibe the fast-changing industry demands. Such challenges in some countries and media industries put journalism educators in an advantageous position, offering them an agency to actively shape the contours of industry practice than getting shaped by it. From this perspective, the present study tries to understand data journalism practices in India and suggests certain insights to integrate data journalism training in programmes offered by Indian journalism education. By probing insights from the literature on data journalism education and by examining existing data journalism practices in India, the study calls for intervention with a pedagogic strategy to impart better data-sourcing practices, coding skills and critical data literacy among the students as an antidote to the prevalent DIY culture and overdependence on data aggregates. The pedagogic strategy should convey the importance of audience centrality and ethics in data journalism practice. It argues that such an approach can, in effect, improve industry practices as well as the quality of journalism education in India.

N2 - This scoping review addresses internationally published empirical studies on the subject of technology-enhanced creativity. The study aims to identify the types of technological tools used to enhance students’ creativity and examine how technological tools can support students’ creativity in K-12 music education. This review selected and analyzed 17 studies published from 1987 to 2022 in peer-reviewed journals using a rigorous five-stage scoping framework. Data extraction and analysis were conducted in Covidence. The results revealed eight types of technological tools used to enhance creativity in the music classroom, in which sequencer software and GarageBand were the most commonly used type of technological tools and applications respectively. Technology’s support for creativity was also discussed from the perspectives of Lubart’s four roles of computers: (a) computer as nanny, (b) computer as pen-pal, (c) computer as coach, and (d) computer as colleague. The results showed a dearth of research on how technology can become students’ partners to help them generate creative ideas. Based on the findings, this review concluded with implications and recommendations for future research.

N2 - Abstract Increasing demand from the consumer for higher levels of refinement from their passenger vehicles has put considerable pressure on the automotive industry to produce ever quieter cars. In order to prevent the occurrence of many forms of brake noise, especially judder and drone, excessive heating of the brake disc must be avoided, while minimizing temperature variations across the rotor. In order for this to be achieved the brake rotor must be designed such that it ensures sufficient uniform heat dissipation and thermal capacity. In high-demand braking applications, vented discs consisting of two rubbing surfaces separated by straight radial vanes are normally employed, as they utilize a greater surface area to dissipate heat. Within this paper the effects of changing the geometry of the first row of pins on aerothermo-dynamic properties of a pin-vented brake rotor are investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The validated CFD model shows that decreasing the thickness of the first row of pins by 10 per cent improves the mass flowrate through the rotor by 14 per cent and the heat transfer rate by 6 per cent. The results obtained can be used for the design of brake discs which are efficient with respect to heat dissipation.

N2 - In this article, noise spectrum of marine propellers is investigated in uniform flow under non-cavitating and cavitating conditions. New results are presented for this research field. Hydrodynamic performance of both non-cavitating and cavitating marine propellers is first analyzed by viscous and potential based flow solvers. In viscous solver, sheet cavitation on propeller blades is simulated with Schnerr–Sauer cavitation model based on Rayleigh Plesset equation using volume of fluid approach. Numerical hydrodynamic results based on viscous solver is compared with potential solver and then validated with experimental data of benchmark David Taylor Model Basin 4119 model propeller. Later, noise spectrum of model propellers is predicted by a hybrid method which combines Reynolds-averaged Navier Stokes and Ffowcs Williams Hawkings equations. Computed noise spectrum is compared with other numerical studies in the literature for the selected model propeller. In addition, hydrodynamic and hydroacoustic pressures are compared in near field to show reliability of numerical solution. Effects of blade number on hydrodynamic performance and noise spectrum are also investigated. Numerical results indicated that as blade number increases, propeller noise level decreases for different loading conditions due to decreased blade loading (circulation) per blade. However, propeller efficiency increases as blade number decreases.

N2 - The performances of non-seasonal time series models assumed on outlier free series in describing the generating mechanism of an outlier is discussed. The contribution of the magnitude of outliers and bias introduced into these models are investigated. Analytically we have shown that the magnitude of outlier depends on the respective weight of their generating mechanism, although it was found that for an additive outlier model the estimates of outliers gave an unbiased estimate of the actual values observed. For a given innovative model, the first observation, if certified as outlier, has the same magnitude as the actual observed value. The efficiency of the estimates of the outliers varies according to the weights of their generating mechanisms. Analytically, additive model is more efficient for all the generating mechanism if the weights ’s lie within the unit circle. An empirical comparison of the analytical study is considered using three simulated series.

N2 - A theoretical study is presented for predicting the hygrothermal behavior of laminated composite plates during moisture desorption. This investigation is aimed at overcoming the computational difficulties in the determination of transient hygroscopic stress distribution through laminated plates and in the evaluation of the effect of anisotropy on the evolution of such stresses. To calculate such stresses during desorption phase, we present a new method by which we are able to predict directly the evolution of transient hygroscopic stresses within laminated composite plates without the calculation of moisture concentrations as in the case of Benkeddad’s method in which we are obliged to determine the moisture distribution across the plate before the calculation of such stresses. This is very important and must be taken into account in the design of composite material, particularly aerospace structures for example, aircraft. The second part of this investigation is devoted to the analysis of the effect of anisotropy on the hygrothermal behavior of laminated plates during moisture desorption. The polar representation method of anisotropic properties is selected as a convenient tool for this study. By this method, the author is able to assess the anisotropy of composite laminated plates using the degree of anisotropy. Some stacking sequences with different in-plane degree of anisotropy were investigated in order to show the effect of anisotropy on the transverse hygroscopic stresses. Finally, the results of this paper can be used to guide the derivation of future by opening a way for the optimal design of composite structures submitted to a moist environment.

N2 - The purpose of the 427M Improvement Program is to replace and update the computer, communications, and display facility used to support the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) and the Aerospace Defense Command in accomplishing their assigned missions, through 1980. The interface between the human operators and the several complete computer systems of the Space Computational Center (SCC) and NORAD is the Interactive Display Console. The SCC/NCS (NORAD Computer System) Graphic Display Console must meet specific Air Force readability, look-angle, accessibility, and maintenance requirements, as well as the restrictive space, weight, and power requirements. Both the SCC and NCS display presentations require extensive use of display vectors to construct maps and backgrounds in addition to presenting the data. The problems of legibility require evaluating the advantages of stroke-generation techniques over the raster-scan technology in producing straight, clearly defined vectors. Also, the system requires a highly reliable, modularly expandable, high-throughput system which would apply to both the SCC and NCS man/machine interface requirements. To effectively maintain the display console hardware, it should be identical for both the SCC and NCS segments; however, the segments must be addressable for different functional operations and displayed information. Thus the operational parameters were assigned to software programs. Functions of the SCC include space catalog maintenance, space sensor system status, space weapons support, system control and support, programming support, and personnel subsystem support. To perform these functions within the allowable time constraints, a highly automated and highly interactive computer system is needed. The Human Factors role in console definition, man/computer interface considerations, and facility layout problems will be discussed in the paper.
