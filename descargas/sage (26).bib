abstract = {In this response to Ambrose, VanTassel-Baska, Coleman, and Cross’s (2010) thought-provoking article on the nature and state of the field of gifted education, the author first discusses the role of disciplinary knowledge in his field. He argues that gifted education, as a normative and practical endeavor (i.e., a profession), is different from academic disciplines in research agendas and that technical rationality is not sufficient for identifying its “best practice.” The author then suggests a “flat” structure to facilitate close collaboration between theorists, researchers, and practitioners in tackling pressing problems and fashioning innovative practices. To facilitate discussion of explorations in our practice, he delineates three basic service models or paradigms in gifted education as follows: the gifted child paradigm, the talent development paradigm, and the differentiation paradigm. He proposes five criteria for assessing their strengths and potential weaknesses. Finally, he suggests that the best way of providing evidence-based best practice is through use-inspired, design studies, which not only address the question of whether a practical model works but also specify goals, assumptions, resources, processes, and constraints involved so that “how it works” is made transparent.}

abstract = {Computational Intelligence (CI) paradigms reveal to be potential tools to face under the Web uncertainty. In particular, CI techniques may be properly exploited to handle Web usage data and develop Web-based applications tailored on users preferences. The main rationale behind this success is the synergy resulting from CI components, such as fuzzy logic, neural networks and genetic algorithms. In fact, rather than being competitive, each of these computing paradigms provides complementary reasoning and searching methods that allow the use of domain knowledge and empirical data to solve complex problems. This paper focuses on the major Computational Intelligent combinations applied in the context of Web personalization, by providing different examples of intelligent systems which have been designed to provide Web users with the information they search, without expecting them to ask for it explicitly. In particular, this paper emphasizes the suitability of hybrid schemes deriving from the profitable combination of different CI methodologies for the development of effective Web personalization systems.}

abstract = {The use of a pedagogical approach mediated transfer with the bridging method has been successful in facilitating the transitions from block-based to text-based programming languages. Nevertheless, there is a lack of research addressing the impact of this transfer on programming misconceptions during the transition. The way programming concepts are taught to K-12 learners can later result in misconceptions for adult learners. The main objective was to examine the impact of mediated transfer using the bridging method pedagogical approach on the prevalence of programming misconceptions. We conducted a quasi-experimental study in school settings during informatics (computer science) classes among 163 sixth-grade students. The control group received traditional programming lectures using the text-based programming language, Python. Conversely, the experimental group utilized a mediated transfer pedagogical approach by starting with the block-based programming language MakeCode for micro:bit before transitioning to the text-based Python. Our findings indicate that the experimental group significantly reduced programming misconceptions in fundamental programming concepts: variables, sequencing, selection, and loops - compared to the control group. This suggests that the use of block-based programming language as an initial step in programming education, followed by a structured transition to text-based programming language, can effectively mitigate common misconceptions among K-12 learners.}

abstract = {To deal with ever-larger datasets, media scholars are increasingly using computational analytic methods. This article focuses on how the traditional (manual) approach to conducting a content analysis—a primary method in the study of media messages—is being reconfigured, assesses what is gained and lost in turning to computational solutions, and builds on a “hybrid” approach to content analysis. We argue that computational methods are most fruitful when variables are readily identifiable in texts and when source material is easily parsed. Manual methods, though, are most appropriate for complex variables and when source material is not well digitized. These modes can be effectively combined throughout the process of content analysis to facilitate expansive and powerful analyses that are reliable and meaningful.}

abstract = {We propose a new performance metric based on computational action. We examine work as it evolves in time and compute computational action as the integral of the work function over time. We compare the action generated at less than full power with the action that could have been generated at full power. We claim that the goal of performance optimization is to minimize lost, or wasted, action. We calculate our metric for some computers in the Top500 list (http://www.top500.org) and propose a new ranking based on least action wasted. When work is a function of the resources applied, we use the classical techniques of the calculus of variations to minimize wasted action. From the result of this exercise, we calculate productivity as the ratio of work produced to resources used.}

abstract = {This study focused on the digital design practices of Raul, a 15-year-old participant at a summer video game design camp for adolescents. As Raul developed his original game, You Will Perish, I wondered what his design process might reveal about (a) the practice of affectively and procedurally literate video game design and (b) the literacy pedagogies that can support such design. Guided by the concept of serendipity, I describe Raul’s design practice as an open process characterized by bouts of failure, chance, and discovery, and I examine how such forces shaped the emergence of his game. Using transversal analysis, I trace Raul’s design through an account of frustration and failure, perseverance and pride, showing how the challenges of the game’s creator become those of the game’s players. The study highlights the generative potential of serendipitous literacies wherever and whenever literacy happens.}

abstract = {Computer-based design and fabrication systems in architecture contain modes of operation and preferences that often constrain tectonic possibilities in design and construction. These predispositions neglect architecture’s cultural and material dimensions, resulting in universalizing tectonics that erase nuances of place, culture, and expression in design. How may we celebrate local tectonic languages while also revisiting them through computer-based systems in architecture? The project examined here highlights novel possibilities for cultural expression and craftsmanship through computational design methods, retaining the expressive potential of a local craft while de-familiarizing its cultural context. I analyze how shape grammars and digital fabrication methods deployed in design, de-familiarizes the craft of wire-bending in costuming in the Trinidad Carnival. I present and apply new rules for the craft’s computational description based on material tests and an architectural application to expand discourses on critical regionalism. I adopt Tabbarah’s term “computational regionalism” to describe this process and elaborate it as a five-step sequence. Computational regionalism employs computational methods to translate local craft knowledge and tectonic languages into new interpretations and poetics of construction. Its process of creative de-familiarization raises critical questions about the local and the universal.}
