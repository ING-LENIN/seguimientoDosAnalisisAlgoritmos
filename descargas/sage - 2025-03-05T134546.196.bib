abstract = {This paper argues that analyses of the ways in which Big Data has been enacted in other academic disciplines can provide us with concepts that will help understand the application of Big Data to social questions. We use examples drawn from our Science and Technology Studies (STS) analyses of -omic biology and high energy physics to demonstrate the utility of three theoretical concepts: (i) primary and secondary inscriptions, (ii) crafted and found data, and (iii) the locus of legitimate interpretation. These help us to show how the histories, organisational forms, and power dynamics of a field lead to different enactments of big data. The paper suggests that these concepts can be used to help us to understand the ways in which Big Data is being enacted in the domain of the social sciences, and to outline in general terms the ways in which this enactment might be different to that which we have observed in the ‘hard’ sciences. We contend that the locus of legitimate interpretation of Big Data biology and physics is tightly delineated, found within the disciplinary institutions and cultures of these disciplines. We suggest that when using Big Data to make knowledge claims about ‘the social’ the locus of legitimate interpretation is more diffuse, with knowledge claims that are treated as being credible made from other disciplines, or even by those outside academia entirely.}

abstract = {Assessing evolution of cognitive structures across historical periods has remained challenging in the absence of direct access to humans from the past. Overcoming some of these challenges, we examined shifts in the implicit cognitive structures in the Epic of Gilgamesh, which is one of the earliest surviving pieces of literature, circulating in various versions over a period of approx. 2000 years in ancient Mesopotamia. Using a canonical English translation, we applied natural language processing (NLP) and human coding to extract low-dimensional representations of the implicit personality structure in three different historical epochs. We found systematic shifts over time with increasing complexity and increasing resemblance of contemporary personality models in later periods. We discuss how lexical analyses of ancient texts using trait co-occurrence analyses can provide novel insights on the evolution of human behaviour of relevance for contemporary social and behavioural science and the study of ancient societies.}

abstract = {The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of material models, element types, and boundary conditions on the consistency of finite element analysis. Two cantilever beams were used; one made of stainless steel SUS301 3/4H and the other made of polymer polyoxymethylene. The load–deflection curves of the two cantilever beams obtained by experiments were compared to those obtained by finite element analysis, where the material models—including bilinear, trilinear, and multi-linear—were used. Four element types—beam, plane stress, shell, and solid—were also employed with the material models to obtain the simulated load–deflection curves of the cantilever beams. It was found that bilinear material models had the stiffest behavior due to their overestimated yield strength. In addition, by applying a finite displacement to simulate the grip of the cantilever beams, the discrepancy between the simulated permanent set and the experimental set could be reduced from 80% to 5%. To sum up, both the selection of the material model and the setup of the boundary conditions are critical for obtaining good agreement between the finite element analysis results and the experimental data.}

abstract = {This research study investigates US middle school students’ collaborative information-seeking, sense-making and knowledge-building practices in a guided discovery-based programme of game design learning in which students and their teachers participate in a formal, in-school class daily, for credit and a grade for an entire year. The learning is supported by information affordances including a wiki learning management system (LMS) housing the curriculum, organized design activities, social media features, tutorials and informational assignments. Students engage in a Constructionist blended learning setting in their classroom, and work collaboratively in teams on game design. The study draws on qualitative video data from six team cases using a coding scheme of categories for the concepts of task, collaborative information seeking (CIS) Modality, and inquiry resolution outcomes. The study also considers linkages between processes and learning outcomes. Variation in engagement across the categories among students was charted, and certain patterns emerged. Findings indicate that some categories of task appear related to some categories of students’ chosen CIS Modality for solving problems. Further, CIS processes in support of tasks appear related to inquiry incident resolution (resolved/unresolved). For student completion of advanced programming tasks in particular, we observe more frequent uses of the wiki-based LMS resources, and greater levels of challenge in fulfilling tasks. Results support existing work on these theoretical constructs in the information sciences, and lead to questions on how naturalistic emergence of CIS practices result from greater task knowledge, and whether learned CIS practices (as tasks in and of themselves) can yield project task knowledge gains. Findings of the study and the ongoing questions the work invites hold instructional design implications, and show how social constructivist educational contexts involving collaborative and information seeking and knowledge building among youth game designers can contribute to scholarly understanding of these processes more broadly in related project-based work contexts occurring among both youth and adults.}

abstract = {Nitrogen oxides are considered as one of the greenhouse gases. Among the most significant emission sources for this gas is a natural gas-fired power plant. The United Nations General assembly suggested in 1988 that human activities can negatively impact weather patterns, and thus they should be controlled. This control policy can improve the efficiency of final consumers such as power plants, cars, or other energy-intensive industries. In this paper, the existing strategies and explicitly making the dry low nitrogen oxides burner reduce greenhouse gases in power plants are explored. The geometry of the burner has been produced in a three-dimensional form in GAMBIT software, and the results of the simulation have been expressed through FLUENT software. Contours of pressure, temperature, and velocity of the fluid in the furnace are also derived. It is concluded that the dry low nitrogen oxides burners plan has a better result compared with other strategies.}
