  abstract={Pattern recognition is one of the fundamental competencies associated with computational thinking and STEM education. Although much has been written to define computational thinking (CT), we argue that CT is a multi-faceted construct and specific aspects of CT (such as pattern recognition) should be examined. The purpose of this study is to conduct a systematic review of literature on pattern recognition to define pattern recognition as an aspect of computational thinking. The synthesis included the Engineering Village database (Compendex and INSPEC). We searched peer reviewed articles and the keywords, pattern recognition, pattern generalization and education. The initial search resulted in 208 articles. The screening of abstracts more closely resulted in 17 relevant articles, which were then read in detail by two researchers. The review of this pool resulted in two relevant articles, one with a focus on mathematics education and the other one in the context of medical education. Surprisingly there were no articles that examined pattern recognition as part of engineering or computer education. Further research examining specific aspects of CT is necessary.},

  abstract={This work is the result of an investigation carried out within the framework of a research grant. The work experience that this team carried out was aimed at describing and systematizing the configuration of computational thinking, its incidence and validity in the educational field from the analysis of public policies, from an interdisciplinary approach. The experience carried out was developed based on a bibliographic and documentary analysis work, which allowed recovering the concept of computational thinking to analyze it in conjunction with the development of critical pedagogical practice and the concept of competences. Here an analysis of some of the current debates presented by computational thinking and its teaching is presented in order to promote a line of dialogue and problematization between what was done, is done and is projected on this subject.},

  abstract={A new class of genetic algorithms (GA) is presented. It is based on the idea of outsourcing, a popular trend in business. In a human based genetic algorithm (HBGA), all primary genetic operators are outsourced, i.e. delegated to external human agents. A totally outsourced genetic algorithm uses both human evaluation and the human ability of innovation. It is a multi-agent environment and the mediator of communication between multiple heterogenous agents. The advantage of this approach is its ability to address complex problems for which it is hard, not only to evaluate individuals, but to find a good representation for them. These qualities allow HBGA to process flows of information without knowledge of its particular structure and representation. The suggested conceptual approach can also be used as a general model and a way of thinking about different kinds of genetic algorithms.},

  abstract={The kind of students that currently arrive in the classroom in this technological age require a learning model that promotes their motivation for learning and thus boosts their creative thinking skills to develop disciplinary and cross-cutting competencies in their courses. It is of utmost importance to provide the students with comprehensive training and improve their competitiveness in their professional field by enhancing the skills of future generations to develop both the transversal and disciplinary competencies required that will allow them to become professionals who face challenges and opportunities in their future lives. Disciplinary competencies are the minimum necessary set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes in their disciplinary field for students to perform successfully in different contexts. Traditionally, the evaluation of knowledge is used to evaluate the student's competencies in a course, and it does not usually reflect the degree of achievement of the student's competencies since these evaluations are based on specific topics and not on the acquisition of the competencies that the course should generate. The objective of this study is to design the evaluation criteria for the disciplinary competencies of Computer Science in students, as well as to measure their impact concerning the different subjects of their academic plan.},

  title={Making Figures for Class Materials Using KETpic Based on Symbolic Thinking}, 
  year={2011},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={93-101},
  abstract={Many mathematics teachers produce original course materials with figures because their use enables students to comprehend mathematical objects. This paper presents a model for producing effective figures for use in course materials. LaTeX is often used to edit course materials and they often use computer algebra system (CAS) to insert graphical image files into the materials. We developed KETpic as a plug-in based on CAS to insert precise and expressive figures into a LaTeX document. After KETpic generates LaTeX-readable codes, the resultant figure is a monochrome, high-quality line drawing. Consequently, teachers can easily improve the quality of their materials. When they produce a figure using KETpic, they can perform mathematical operations as they consider combinations of KETpic commands as mathematical symbols. We designate this mathematical activity as symbolic thinking. By performing symbolic thinking, they need not be overly concerned about writing a program for CAS. Instead, they can concentrate on consideration of more important matters of cognition such as producing an effective figure. They require an advantageous environment in which they can easily perform symbolic thinking. This paper presents two sufficient conditions for this environment: (i) they produce new KETpic commands as the modularization of mathematical operations that they frequently use, and (ii) they create an original package of new KETpic commands. In this paper, we present some examples for these propositions using KETpic based on Scilab.},

  abstract={This paper examines the assembly of interdisciplinary teams in emerging scientific fields. We develop and validate a hybrid systems dynamics and agent-based computational model using data over a 15 year period from the assembly of teams in the emerging scientific field of Oncofertility. We found that, when a new field emerges, team assembly is influenced by the reputation and seniority of the researchers, prior collaborators, prior collaborators' collaborators, and the prior popularity of an individual as a collaborator by all others. We also found that individuals are more likely to assemble into an Oncofertility team when there is a modicum of overlap across its global ecosystem of teams; the ecosystem is defined as the collection of teams that share members with other teams that share members with the Oncofertility team.},

  abstract={Nurturing programming talent early is crucial in today's digital world, especially in K-12 education, underscored by the rise of programming competitions for younger students. However, with limited research in programming talent search, discovering programming talent in primary schools posed a significant challenge. Traditionally, various test-based talent search tools have been utilized for programming talent identification, including the Computer Talent Search Test (CTST) and the Beginners Computational Thinking Test (BCTt). Game-based platforms like CodeCombat offer an engaging alternative to overcome this challenge. CodeCombat integrates game-based learning with programming education, allowing students to apply their computational thinking skills in an enjoyable context for learning Python. The study revealed a significant correlation between CodeCombat, CTST, and BCTt outcomes. This highlighted that CodeCombat emerged as a valuable platform for talent search, aligning seamlessly with the objectives of the test-based tools and suggesting its effectiveness in boosting programming learning motivation in primary school.},

  pages={551-556 Vol.1},
  abstract={The anticipatory timing control in sensory-motor coupling is indispensable to generate coordinative movement among humans, however its cognitive mechanism still remains obscure. In this study we used synchronization tapping task as a model system, and negative asynchrony phenomenon where the tap onset precedes the stimulus onset was analyzed as an example of the anticipation. Especially, applying dual task method, the relationship between the anticipation mechanism and the higher brain function such as attention and working memory was investigated. The results revealed two types of anticipatory timing control. In the inter stimulus-onset interval (ISI) range of 450 to 1800 ms, automatic anticipation that is not affected by attentional resources was observed and was based on feed forward dynamics. In the 2400 to 3600 ms range, the anticipation showed trade-off relationship in the allocation of attentional resources. Magnitude of synchronization error (SE) between tap onset and stimulus onset in this region was scaled by the ISI and the feed back dynamics concerning ISI was suggested. Accordingly, anticipation in timing control was shown to be a dual processing between the attentional process and the embodied automatic process.},

  abstract={In this paper we show that, when dealing with genetic structures of cognition, Piaget's approach is the most convenient algebraic form of logic structure to use and which classical logic can be derived from. But the formal rationality provided by the derived “semantic squares” is not spontaneous at rational level, and therefore, should not be easy to learn for adults. This is the main reason why we need reliable and effective training tools to achieve full logic and predicative proficiency, like the Elementary Pragmatic Model (EPM). We present the basic considerations towards the development of computational, intelligent tutoring system (ITS), taking in focus the computational model for current reasoning fallacies based on Piaget-Klein Fourgroup and related EPM training tool to achieve predicative proficiency. EPM and ITS can also contribute to AI and cognitive informatics, helping to develop autonomous reasoning system for person-centered learning and training to predicative competence and decision making.},

Student participants were 11 third graders at one public elementary school in Taiwan. The project in an after-school learning program lasted for five weeks. During weekly learning session, each student needed to use one visual block programming called Ozoblockly to design action patterns for their robots (Ozobot). The study adopted a case study methodology to examine the specific learning scenario. The principal researcher used a participant observation method to observe students' learning behaviors, informal after-class interviews to collect students' learning responses, and a portfolio analysis approach to examine students' programming works. The findings showed that students might obtain a basic understanding of a computer engineer after the instructional intervention. Furthermore, some specific learning patterns from young children's programming process were identified.},

The method combines Verlet neighbor lists with coarse-grained cells. Each processing node is associated with a cubic volume of space and the particles it owns are those initially contained in the volume. Data structures for 'own' and 'visitor' particle coordinates are maintained in each node. Visitors are particles owned by one of the 26 neighboring cells but lying within an interaction range of a face. The Verlet neighbor list includes pointers to own-own and own-visitor interactions. To communicate, each of the 26 neighbor cells sends a corresponding block of particle coordinates using message-passing cells. The algorithms has the numerical properties of the standard serial Verlet method and is efficient for hundreds to thousands of particles per node allowing the simulation of large systems with millions of particles. Preliminary results on the new CM-5 supercomputer are described.<>},

  pages={195974-195985},
  abstract={Supply chain network design is a critical strategic challenge that significantly influences operational efficiency and competitiveness in the global marketplace. This paper introduces Think4SCND, a novel deep reinforcement learning framework that addresses the dynamic complexities of supply chain network design by integrating a Supply Chain Transformer Network with a Thinking Model. Our approach formulates the supply chain network design problem as a Markov Decision Process, developing an architecture capable of handling mixed discrete-continuous action spaces. The core innovation lies in the Thinking Model, which enhances the Supply Chain Transformer Network’s ability to reason about future states and evaluate decision sequences, enabling more informed and forward-looking decision-making. We propose an end-to-end training algorithm that effectively combines model-free reinforcement learning with model-based planning. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that Think4SCND significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving near-optimal solutions with a fraction of the computational cost. The framework demonstrates superior adaptability to disruptions and strong generalization capabilities, successfully transferring knowledge from medium-sized problems to larger, unseen instances.},

At the completion of the project it was realized that to address the complexity of a Smart Grid with vast numbers of intelligent connected devices and systems, computational intelligence techniques must move from top-down to the lowest levels of architectures, with interactive cooperation between smart components, each with a level of autonomy. The CS-SGVP team emphasized creative thought leadership and “blue sky” thinking to identify future Smart Grid operational visions and the role of computing to achieve these visions. The CS-SGVP team developed its visions using a three-tiered approach. Architectural concepts describe Smart Grid goals and characteristics, general grid types, as well as computing concepts considered common across grid types. Functional concepts describe how the grid will operate. Technological concepts describe the roles of certain technologies within the Smart Grid. The CS-SGVP expects that over the course of many years, various visions will come to fruition.},

Today, by the ubiquitous wireless connectivity, the boost of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and the advances in big data analytics, it is safe to say that IoT has evolved to a new concept called the Internet of Everything (IoE) or the Internet of All. IoE has four pillars, things, human, data, and processes, which render it as an inhomogeneous large-scale network. A crucial challenge of such a network is to develop management, analysis, and optimization policies that besides utility-maximizer machines, also take irrational humans into account. We discuss several networking applications in which appropriate modeling of human decision-making is vital. We then provide a brief review of computational models of human decision-making. Based on one such model, we develop a solution for a task offloading problem in fog computing and we analyze the implications of including humans in the loop.},

  abstract={Meditation has been shown to aid with the management of affective disorders through improving emotion regulation. Here we begin to develop a theory of meditation by creating a computational cognitive model of focused attention meditation. Our model was created within Prims, a derivative of the ACT-R cognitive architecture. We implemented a model based on an extensive literature review of how the meditation experience unfolds over time. We then tested the Prims model in a sustained attention task, intending to capture a faculty that may be trained with meditation practice. The model was significantly better able to maintain focus after the meditation practice than before. These results agree qualitatively with empirical findings of a longitudinal study on the effects of meditation conducted in 2010. The central mechanism for increasing task relevant focus in the model seems to be a feedback loop. The meditation and mind-wandering processes reinforce themselves and weaken the other. However, this reinforcement is more dispersed in the more elaborate mind-wandering process, which causes it to decrease over time. We speculate that observed improvements in emotion regulation observed after meditation arise from the ability to maintain focus, because it allows the practitioner to avoid emotions spiraling out of control.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Opponent Modelling tries to predict the future actions of opponents, and is required to perform well in multiplayer games. There is a deep literature on learning an opponent model, but much less on how accurate such models must be to be useful. We investigate the sensitivity of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and a Rolling Horizon Evolutionary Algorithm (RHEA) to the accuracy of their modelling of the opponent in a simple Real-Time Strategy game. We find that in this domain RHEA is much more sensitive to the accuracy of an opponent model than MCTS. MCTS generally does better even with an inaccurate model, while this will degrade RHEA's performance. We show that faced with an unknown opponent and a low computational budget it is better not to use any explicit model with RHEA, and to model the opponent's actions within the tree as part of the MCTS algorithm.},

  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-5},
  abstract={This work-in-progress research paper presents the preliminary results of a study exploring the effectiveness of using computational notebooks to enhance student learning in a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) course for undergraduate Mechanical Engineering students. Our previous work has shown that students often face difficulties in grasping abstract concepts from mechanics of materials while simultaneously learning computational modeling. However, students recognized several advantages of using MATLAB for FEA compared to manual calculations, including significant time savings, increased efficiency, and reduced errors. Nevertheless, they also faced challenges, including a steep learning curve for MATLAB and concerns about how this limitation hinders their conceptual understanding. Despite these drawbacks, they recognized the importance and value of developing computational skills for their future careers. In this study, we extended the scaffolds and changed the sequence of activities to address the challenges the students faced in the previous iteration of our work. Specifically, we provided worked examples that students needed to use, self-explain, and modify before they engaged in programming from scratch. Also, after developing a basic understanding of how to implement FEA in MATLAB, the students used ChatGPT to generate a code that would do the same task. This activity required them to evaluate and refine automatically generated MATLAB code, as ChatGPT may provide alternative solutions that might not always work correctly. We explore three main topics to understand student experiences with and perceptions of this approach: (1) the value of using computational methods compared to manual completion for FEA; (2) the challenges and support of using MATLAB for FEA; and (3) the effectiveness of simulation tools to learn FEA. The goal of this project is two-fold: (1) supporting student learning of intricate phenomena explored in mechanics of materials, like distribution of stress, and stiffness, and (2) fostering essential computational thinking skills through practical disciplinary coding experience. By implementing these elements, the study anticipates a substantial improvement in students' understanding of FEA principles and their ability to translate them into solutions for real-world engineering challenges.},

  abstract={Advanced mathematics is a fundamental subject in college education, essential for developing students’ analytical and problem-solving skills. It forms the basis for many advanced topics and is crucial for a well-rounded academic foundation. Mathematical modeling, on the other hand, is a powerful tool for addressing real-world problems by creating abstract models. It is widely applied in fields like economics, industry, medicine, and social sciences. With the rapid advancement of computer technology, mathematical modeling has evolved significantly. Tools like MATLAB have become essential for developing and analyzing complex models, enabling the resolution of intricate problems that are difficult to solve manually. The integration of computer technology into mathematical modeling enhances both the efficiency and accuracy of problem-solving.Given these advancements, it is crucial for colleges and universities to incorporate computer-based mathematical modeling into their curriculum. By integrating these techniques into advanced mathematics courses, educators can create a more cohesive learning experience that combines theoretical knowledge with practical applications. This approach not only improves the quality of mathematics education but also better prepares students to apply their mathematical skills to real-world challenges, equipping them for professional success in a rapidly changing world.},

Each state of baseline nonnative acoustic model is modified with several candidate states from the auxiliary acoustic model, which is trained on speakers' mother language. State mapping criterion and n-best candidates are investigated, and different numbers of Gaussian mixtures of the auxiliary acoustic model are compared based on a grammar-constrained speech recognition system. Using this bilingual model modification approach, compared to the nonnative acoustic model which has already been well trained by adaptation technique MAP, the Phrase Error Rate further achieves a 5.83% relative reduction, while only a small relative increase on Real Time Factor occurs.},

  abstract={Systems thinking approaches are employed to construct a formal decision making methodology for equitably allocating water among competing users in a river basin when taking into account both the societal and physical systems aspects of the allocation problem. In particular, within the societal component of the decision problem, multiple participants, their multiple objectives, equity principles, and economic factors are considered, while the physical systems part reflects relevant hydrologic and environmental factors. The Cooperative Water Allocation Model (CWAM) incorporates these societal and physical systems concerns within the framework of a large-scale optimization program which is divided into two main steps. Firstly, water is allocated among users based on existing legal water rights regimes or agreements. Secondly, water and associated benefits are reallocated among stakeholders to maximize basin-wide welfare. CWAM is applied to the South Saskatchewan River Basin located in the Canadian province of Alberta to demonstrate how it can be conveniently applied to a water allocation system of systems problem.},

  abstract={Computer science is becoming ever increasingly important to our society. Computer science content has, however, not traditionally been considered a natural part of curricula for primary and secondary education. Computer science has traditionally been primarily a university level discipline and there are no widely accepted general standards for what computer science at K-12 level entails. Also, as the interest in this area is rather new, the amount of research conducted in the field is still limited. In this paper we review how 10 different countries have approached introducing computer science into their K-12 education. The countries are Australia, England, Estonia, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, South Korea, Poland and USA. The studied countries either emphasize digital competencies together with programming or the broader subject of computer science or computing. Computational thinking is rarely mentioned explicitly, but the ideas are often included in some form. The most common model is to make computer science content compulsory in primary school and elective in secondary school. A few countries have made it compulsory in both, while some countries have only introduced it in secondary school.},

Generalized research on the effectiveness of the flipped classroom is emerging, and results have been mixed. One such model is team-based learning (TBL) as originally developed by Larry Michaelsen in the late 1970s. TBL is a structured way to implement a flipped classroom approach, and has been shown to be successful in achieving deeper learning among the students. In this paper, we discuss our experience using the TBL methodology in a graduate computer engineering course on system level design of embedded systems. Specifically, we describe the course design, instructor experience adapting TBL for use in the course, including implementing an asynchronous online TBL process, and instructor reflections and student feedback on what worked well and what did not. We analyze the course content using the Florida Taxonomy of Cognitive Behavior, and assess the effectiveness of our implementation in achieving deeper learning. Additionally, we report on student perception of the new course structure and their experience using TBL.},

One of these components is the use of modern computational and programming tools to solve engineering problems. This paper continues a long-term study that began in 2007 and focuses on student confidence with the use of computational tools. On the first day of class, students were surveyed on their proficiency with the use of spreadsheets. Students self reported levels of proficiency from expert to no experience. Students were then asked a simple question regarding a spreadsheet cell equation. Over three years only 16% of the students were correct, while 90% self ranked as familiar or better. A gender bias was noted as women under estimated their skills while men overestimated their own abilities. This study contributes to the growing body of knowledge of gender confidence gaps. Additionally, it lays the groundwork for creating an assessment plan to identify the preparedness of incoming students and measure their skill at the end of the course.},

  pages={1-1},
  abstract={There has been a well-documented and persistent drop in the number of women in computer science and engineering courses [1]. Young peoples' decisions about participation often start early and have been linked to particular experiences [2]. For some young people, these experiences are less than encouraging. In the US, high school computer science courses are overwhelmingly male dominated [3]. Schools serving minority students and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often struggle to even offer such classes [4]. Even when opportunities exist, many girls and underrepresented populations face barriers such as negative stereotypes and dearth of role models and community [5]. The Digital Youth Divas program was created to address these issues through intentional design. The program is developed to trigger situational interest [6] in girls through a combination of community, project-based instruction, on- and offline learning spaces, and narrative stories. Triggered situational interest is critical as an opening to move on to subsequent phases that are more independent of environmental factors. Understanding potential effective triggers for girls, minorities, and youth from lower socioeconomic backgrounds is critical to engaging such populations in STEM learning. (1) Community: Middle school girls interested in fashion and design are recruited, especially from areas that have traditionally been underserved. Adult mentors who are not engineers, but share cultural connections with the girls and have gone through curriculum and pedagogical training, attend to specific practices of encouraging, helping to troubleshoot, and developing community. (2) Project-based instruction: The program combines principles of fashion, design, and dance with the power and possibilities of electronic circuits and programming to develop interactive e-fashion projects and virtual programmed choreographies. Scaffolded challenges work through stages of design and computational thinking, including paper prototyping, implementation, feedback, and revision. (3) Integrated on and offline learning spaces: Girls work through projects in a shared physical space using supplied materials. An online system, iRemix, is the mechanism for independent work and leveling up. (4) Interactive narrative stories: Narratives can provide context that helps relate abstract concepts to real-world issues [7], increase motivation and positively contribute to girls' science identity [8], and provide focus for design by communicating tasks, specifically when readers can identify with the stories [9]. Compelling stories conveyed in text and multimedia (video, audio, images) is employed to engage middle school girls in activities involving computational thinking. The stories center on a group of middle school girls involved in the Digital Youth Divas program, and combines aspects of contemporary young adult fiction (mystery, social and emotional issues) with content, topics, and project work from the e-textiles and programming curricula. The interactive narratives unfold through the iRemix platform: girls launch narratives and at intervals are prompted to engage in project-based work. The girls solve challenges by submitting work online, and receive and respond to messages from characters. Our early exploratory research suggested that narratives prompted discussions of identity, and contributed to participant interest in the program content and motivation to engage in project work.},

We define the economical simulation problem (ESP) as designing the simulation of a stable linear system and distributing computational resources (wordlength) among the digital devices such that the computational cost (memory) is minimized without violating the required simulation accuracy. This problem is generally not convex because of the scaling constraint. By exploring the special structure of this joint optimization of the choice of the realizations and the computational resources to be applied, and under a scaling assumption, the ESP is converted to a convex problem. Numerical results are given which compare this method with existing approaches.},

  abstract={The Industry 5.0 requires new skills in a rapidly changing labor market. Generation Z is the first generation of digital natives whose skills to operate digital tools are unquestionable. At the same time, their communication, collaboration, and team-building skills lack the necessary depth to succeed in the world of work. Alongside other technological improvements, Education 4.0 has proposed the introduction of new learning and teaching methods such as project, problem, and design-based approaches. In this comparative study, the project-based approach is presented. The aim of the research was to investigate the teamwork skills of engineering students. 177 students were interviewed about how each project team works together and which skills and competences are missing to succeed together. The results of the quantitative research show that self-assessment scores in all subsamples outperformed the assessment of teams. The results can be incorporated into a future teaching methodology framework for skills development.},

  abstract={The importance of change management is still under-emphasised in lean transformation because many people are not familiar with change management models. This may be an area that needs more attention in the future. The survey shows that there are professionals at all levels, but also where there are gaps. However, it gives hope that in the coming years these gaps will be filled and more effective lean transformations can be led. The main lessons from the survey can help to set priorities for the coming years. Those in the support phase are the least aware of the importance of a blame-free environment, which is a key factor for effective lean transformation. In the application phase, there is a clear lack of awareness of the Kanban system. The lack of knowledge of plant management is also consistent with the experience. This is also due to the fact that the development of lean was not always based on existing knowledge, but was promoted as a new method different from traditional practices.},

The contextual element is composed of three parts: domain, situation and background. The domain is extracted by merging sentences with the same or similar domain conceptual symbol, which comes from the symbols of conceptual primitives, the conceptual symbols of words, and the semantic chunks in a sentence. The conceptual framework of situation is filled with the right words or phrases, according to the knowledge of domain sentence categories, the sentence categories and semantic chunks. The experiments show that there are still many aspects to be improved, including the knowledge base, analyzing the semantic structures of sentences, and matching the conceptual symbols in different types.},

  abstract={Classical problem in engineering modeling is that product changes and environmental effects on product are hard to propagate in the product model during engineering activities for the lifecycle of products. In order to support change handling, product modeling in current product lifecycle management (PLM) system uses feature and contextual connection definitions to realize self-adaptive characteristics of product model. Actual problems with this model are identified and recent contributions to establish new modeling solutions are introduced in this paper. The main objectives are to enhance self adaptive characteristics of currently applied product models and to extend contextual connections to new features providing higher level knowledge representation capability. Open architecture PLM system representing latest product modeling principles and methods is considered as environment for the research, simulation, and implementation demanded by the proposed extension using new features and contexts.},

  abstract={A great deal of region-related concept detection algorithms have been proposed so far, but there are few of them concerning about the problem of mismatched regions at training and testing stages. In order to investigate the mismatch problem in region-related concept detection, we introduce three kinds of methods to annotate the datasets, and then conduct experiments on differently annotated training and testing datasets. We find from these experiments that the detection performance is the best when the regions of a region-related concept are well defined and matched during training and testing, or the detection performance will be decreased. Based on these observations, we propose a fusion scheme to combine the results of classifiers trained with datasets which are annotated by different methods. Experiments on Trecvid-2007 test corpus show that the proposed fusion scheme can obtain performance improvement up to 6~12%.},

VC is generally a noninteractive process for those contributing computing resources to a project, whereas volunteer thinking (VT) or distributed thinking allows volunteers to participate interactively in CCS projects to solve human computation tasks. In this paper, we describe the integration of three tools, the Virtual Atom Smasher (VAS) game developed by CERN, LiveQ, a job distribution middleware, and CitizenGrid, an online platform for hosting and providing computation to CCS projects. This integration demonstrates the combining of VC and VT to help address the scientific and educational goals of games like VAS. This paper introduces the three tools and provides details of the integration process along with further potential usage scenarios for the resulting platform.},

The truth is that exists lots of teaching methods for developing a computational thinking and these do not depend on the resources mentioned before. Children have demonstrated a big capacity for secure their knowledge if the teaching method is simple and didactic through games and recreational activities. For these reasons, we propose the use of unplugged activities, which do not require the use of computers and has the objective of promoting, clearing out and developing essentials concepts of computer science, as well as developing the computational thinking in kids through a funny and dynamic focus. In this way, they are going to be prepared to enter in a world where the computer science is expanding progressively in each area of daily life.},

  abstract={The application of “programming education” has become one of the future technological trends, and students with design backgrounds should also grasp this important development. In this study, the “AgilePoint NX” program course was established, and computational thinking was introduced into the course to guide students, through the image flow and low-code learning process, to carry out structured thinking and question speculation, and complete task exercises. This aims to teach design students to learn programming and computational thinking through a cloud-based low-code development platform with image processes and interdisciplinary learning processes. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and evaluate the learning effect through classroom learning observation, simple questionnaire survey, imagination scale, and other methods. Finally, the study found that in interdisciplinary programming learning, different factors lead to low learning effects of programming courses for design background students, resulting in different degrees of learning pain points and learning experiences. The power of imagination test is a tentative exploration of this research, but for the low-code development platform with fewer measurement data and biased towards procedural thinking, only predictive exploration has no significant data to show the specific impact on the programming learning process, only As a reference for interdisciplinary study.},

It consists of 3 stages and each stage will focus on students of certain ages. The first stage corresponds to the grades from 1st grade to 2nd grade of primary school. The bases of computational thinking will be developed through dynamics and games, in this way children will not get bored and learn by playing. The second stage is aimed at students from 3rd grade to 6th grade. It consists in introducing the basic concepts of the computation and the use of Scratch once the computational thinking was developed when they were smaller. Finally, in the third stage the programming languages will be taught. This stage is developed throughout high school and will start with the Python language to finish with C ++.},

  abstract={Approximately 25 years have passed since the "sense-act-think" paradigm was advanced as the operational definition of a robot, and as a broad roadmap for robotics research. With the appearance of mobile robots that do real work in the real world, "communicate" has de facto been added to the list of functionalities that are essential features of robots. In keeping with the theme of the ROSE-2003 Workshop, this paper attempts to articulate and justify a set of intellectual and engineering challenges for 21 st century sensing and perception for robotics. It especially argues for examining the current and re-examining future roles for teleoperation, both as a practical route around the improbability that machine intelligence will equal human intelligence in the foreseeable future, and because it is apparent that sensor improvement is driven in large part by incremental advances in sensor-display design-and-test loops that are in turn driven by human factors governing perception.},

These new technologies, ideas and approaches provide a new environment for researching and developing load balancing-oriented job scheduling system. Aiming at the hierarchical Grid model structure, following statistical thinking, this paper proposed a new task scheduling and resource allocation algorithm, which can not only increase the utilization of resources and system throughput, but also realize the load balancing within Grid systems. This algorithm consists of three main modules, they are load tracking module, job distributing module and load monitoring module. On the basis of having explained the functions of the different functional parts and the relationships between them, the corresponding pseudo-code algorithm are given. The results of simulative experiments show that the algorithm is effective.},

  abstract={Models of the cognitions used by engineering students to solve problems have always been a part of engineering education. Many, such as the engineering mechanics model (select free-body, draw vector diagram, write equilibrium equations, and solve equilibrium equations), have been part of the introduction of students to engineering topics for a long time. More recently, student problem-solving processes are being reexamined with an eye towards a deeper understanding of the student problem-solving process and developing new approaches to student problem-solving that develop engineering insight, conceptual knowledge, critical examination, and reflective thinking skills. Several of the more recent problem-solving models reported in the engineering and science education literature are dissected and compared in this paper. This comparison indicates that the motivation, definition, exploration, planning, execution, checking, and generalization model of Wankat and Oreovicz [1] is general enough to accommodate most of the elements (but, not necessarily all) of the other models. When properly implemented, this model also contributes to the development of the additional thinking skills required of modern engineers.},

  abstract={In the area of testing ICs, once an IC has failed a traditional go/no-go test, it needs to be tested further to determine if it can support error-tolerant operation for one or more high volume customers. This test must be very efficient since many chips will probably fail, and those that pass will be sold at a discount. We have already developed several efficient test procedures to support error-tolerance. One is a built-in self-test methodology that can sort chips into various bins based on their error-rate, just like resistors are sorted into 1%, 5% and 10% bins (Breuer, 2004). Digital systems designers have almost always focused on the concept of exact computational capability. Error-tolerant VLSI chips are a step in this direction using today's technologies, addressing current computational needs, and accepting present realities of scale and yield.},

This paper first presents the Indonesia curriculum guideline. This is followed by the discussion of the development process of computing curriculum emphasizing three components: knowledge, skills, and dispositions. The last component is believed to be one of the important components aimed to prepare graduates to have 21st century skills. Then we relate them to the involvement of IT Del in the DECART project, funded by Erasmus Mundus. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate that our existing curriculum development approach has been successful to build expected graduates' competence. This is expected to give an insight to define an agile curriculum framework to face the VUCA world as one of the objectives for the DECART project.},

  abstract={Although deep learning models are powerful among various applications, most deep learning models are still a black box, lacking verifiability and interpretability, which means the decision-making process that human beings cannot understand. Therefore, how to evaluate deep neural networks with explanations is still an urgent task. In this paper, we first propose a multi-semantic image recognition model, which enables human beings to understand the decision-making process of the neural network. Then, we presents a new evaluation index, which can quantitatively assess the model interpretability. We also comprehensively summarize the semantic information that affects the image classification results in the judgment process of neural networks. Finally, this paper also exhibits the relevant baseline performance with current state-of-the-art deep learning models.},

  abstract={A considerable body of research examines people's perceptions of the nature of science. There is also extensive research about what those perceptions are for teachers, and what strategies can be used to change them. There is, however, very little information about what these perceptions may be in the case of computer science. In fact, computer scientists struggle to agree on a definition of their discipline, and perhaps the only term common term to all existing definitions is that of computational thinking. This paper reports on an investigation into perceptions about computer science occurred during a series of professional development workshops for Australian Digital Technologies teachers. These workshops aimed to promote the computer science discipline by providing skills and resources necessary to teach computer science and computational thinking. The results of our investigation indicate that Digital Technologies teachers in our sample (N=16) had one common misconception about the nature of computer science. We also found that the misconception was changed after 3 days of intensive education about computational thinking, computer science and its applications.},

A goal of the Visible Celltrade project is to integrate spatial as well as temporal models within a common data, computational and visualisation environment to support hypothesis-generation and hypothesis-testing by biologists and modellers. A unique feature of this project is our use of actual 3-D cellular structure data, reconstructed from medium-resolution confocal video microscopy and high-resolution electron tomography, to generate the matrix for our visualisation environment. Molecular sequence and protein structure data are obtained from distributed databases via web services.

  abstract={Many important real-world decision making problems involve group interactions among individuals with purely informational externalities, such situations arise for example in jury deliberations, expert committees, medical diagnosis, etc. In this paper, we will use the framework of iterated eliminations to model the decision problem as well as the thinking process of a Bayesian agent in a group decision/discussion scenario. We model the purely informational interactions of rational agents in a group, where they receive private information and act based upon that information while also observing other people's beliefs. As the Bayesian agent attempts to infer the true state of the world from her sequence of observations which include her neighbors' beliefs as well as her own private signal, she recursively refines her belief about the signals that other players could have observed and beliefs that they would have hold given the assumption that other players are also rational. We further analyze the computational complexity of the Bayesian belief formation in groups and show that it is MV-hard. We also investigate the factors underlying this computational complexity and show how belief calculations simplify in special network structures or cases with strong inherent symmetries. We finally give insights about the statistical efficiency (optimality) of the beliefs and its relations to computational efficiency.},

  abstract={This research project aims to investigate, how young men and women differ regarding (1) their perceptions of Computer Science (CS) as a scientific discipline respectively as a professional field and (2) the experiences that had influenced their choice of major subject. For that purpose, we conducted a biographical study of CS freshmen at university. In total, 217 students (54 female, 163 male) participated on the survey. The qualitative analysis showed that young men and women do have different viewpoints on computer science. While the male students tend to focus on technical aspects like hardware, mathematics, or logical issues, the female students are attracted rather by creativity, communication, or job opportunities. Furthermore, we investigated the differences between several courses of study. While students of core Computer Science are emphasizing technical issues and their personal experience with computers, the students of Games Engineering, Information Systems, or Bioinformatics mainly focus on the application fields and regard CS as a tool. All these differences seem to influence the selection of the major subject of the students. They might explain the problem of low enrollment rates in Computer Science and the decreasing number of students in core Computer Science in comparison to the more interdisciplinary courses of study.},

  abstract={Speech summarization is typically performed by using a cascade of speech recognition and text summarization models. End-to-end modeling of speech summarization models is challenging due to memory and compute constraints arising from long input audio sequences. Recent work in document summarization has inspired methods to reduce the complexity of self-attentions, which enables transformer models to handle long sequences. In this work, we introduce a single model optimized end-to-end for speech summarization. We apply the restricted self-attention technique from text-based models to speech models to address the memory and compute constraints. We demonstrate that the proposed model learns to directly summarize speech for the How-2 corpus of instructional videos. The proposed end-to-end model outperforms the previously proposed cascaded model by 3 points absolute on ROUGE. Further, we consider the spoken language understanding task of predicting concepts from speech inputs and show that the proposed end-to-end model outperforms the cascade model by 4 points absolute F-1.},

  abstract={The development agenda is always evolving, for instance the initiation of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) from the millennium development goals (MDGs). On the other hand, rapid technological advances presents both challenges and opportunities to the development agenda. Learning is ever-required in this continuously changing environment. In addition, the global nature of the environment today calls for virtual learning because of convenience, time and cost factors. This research seeks to draw measures to promote virtual learning experience. The research is based on a total virtual learning experience of a masters' level information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) 2.0 course comprised of students in South Africa, Myanmar, Finland and Germany at the University of Tampere. The research included how well the virtual environment and pedagogy promoted constructive, collaborative and conversational learning. In addition, how well the learners' needs, such as, active, reflective and intentional learning are incorporated. The research seeks to promote context in terms of assessing the learning environment, that is, students' virtual learning experience, study contents and learning technologies. Context should be embraced to map the learning process that suits the learners and study contents. The results of this study include highlighting pedagogical techniques and technological tools that fit the learners' and study content requirements to foster learning in a virtual environment. For example in this ICT4D 2.0 course, open learning diary, that is, online submission of students' diaries so that all the course's participants could review, was adopted to make learning more collaborative and conversional. Technological tools, such as, wiki and discussion form were also adopted to promote active and reflective learning in virtual environment. These pedagogical techniques and technological tools have to fit the learning context, thus for instance in the ICT4D class adoption was a result of the mid-course virtual learning review.},

  abstract={Although artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the world quickly, training AI models still requires a lot of money and time. This is so because training an AI model needs a lot of data and processing power. A website that allows users to promote their AI model to other users and pay them for sharing their computer resources to help train it is one suggested solution to this problem. A blockchain-based strategy can be used to do this, and it offers numerous advantages such as lower expenses, effective resource pooling, task automation, precise remuneration, and a decrease in administrative overhead. AI models will thereby become more effective, more reasonably priced, and available to a larger variety of individuals and institutions.},

  abstract={The testability of equipment has become the key factor affecting equipment availability, and detracts from readiness and mission success. To overcome the current problems associated with the analysis of equipment testability, such as non-comprehensive failure mode coverage, low fault detection rate, and low fault location accuracy, this paper presents a system testability modeling and analysis method based on a summary of the results of device level failure mode effect and criticality analysis (FMECA), which is developed according to the failure data of components and a hardware impact analysis. In particular, we present a mathematical multi-signal model, quantitative methods and mathematical models of system testability, and the implementation processes of system testability modeling. The proposed method allows the failure modes of a module to be obtained accurately and comprehensively. By functioning at the device level, the method provides good fault location accuracy, and improves the authenticity of system testability analysis results. Finally, the testability of an actual electronic system is conducted using CARMES, which is a widely used reliability engineering software. The results verify the effectiveness and authenticity of the presented method, which can also provide a reference for the testability modeling and analysis of follow-up system design.},

  abstract={Situation assessment in interactions needs to make an explicit evaluation of the social interactions. When there is more than one agent or ldquoplayerrdquo, the logic of knowledge and belief play an important role. One is interested not only in each personpsilas knowledge and beliefs about substantive matters, but also in his knowledge and beliefs about the others. This paper explored the meta-synthetic computing formula of situation assessment in social interactions. First, each personpsilas knowledge and belief determines the interactive structure, which can be computer-aided calculation. Second, the process of interactions is dynamic, the assessment needs an open interactive environment to analyze and understand the situation, which is human-computer symbiotic. Third, these interactions are supported by the data and information processing algorithm and models. Interactive structure aided by computer, human-computer symbiotic open interactive environment, data and information processing algorithm and models constitute meta-synthetic computing formula of situation assessment.},

  abstract={With quick upgrading of knowledge and high demand for all-round talents at the age of information, the integration of computer multimedia into college English course has altered traditional teaching model. The teaching focus is converted to learning process from content; teacher becomes the organizer and manager of class, the director and supervisor of students instead of the lecturer; students become active and autonomous learners instead of passive receivers. Meanwhile, their collaborative skills and communication styles are improved in the so-called computer-assist teaching model. All in all, this student-centered interactive environment contributes to the improvement of the students' comprehensive English skills. The present authors intend to compare the two models, put forward concrete methods to apply this computer-assist teaching model to college English teaching and some constructive suggestions to the improvement of this new model.},

  pages={640-660},
  abstract={Although there have been many advances in end-user programming environments, recent empirical studies report that programming still remains difficult for end-users. We hypothesize that one reason may be lack of effective support for helping end-user programmers problem-solve their own way around barriers they encounter. Therefore, in this paper, we describe the Idea Garden, a concept designed to help end-user programmers generate new ideas and problem-solve when they run into barriers. The Idea Garden has its roots in Minimalist Learning Theory and problem-solving theories. Our proof-of-concept prototype of the Idea Garden concept in the CoScripter end-user programming environment currently targets three barriers reported in end-user programming literature. It does so using an integrated, just-in-time combination of scaffolding for problem-solving strategies, for design patterns and for programming concepts. Our empirical results showed that this approach helped end-user programmers overcome all three types of barriers that our prototype targeted.},

  year={2019},
  volume={18},
  number={10},
  pages={2446-2459},
  abstract={This paper presents a graph processing based traffic estimation system, GPTE, which is able to achieve high accuracy and high scalability to support city scale traffic estimation. GPTE benefits from its non-linear traffic correlation modeling and the graph-parallel processing framework built on clustered machines. By representing the road network as a property graph, GPTE decomposes the numerous computations involved in non-linear models to vertices and performs traffic estimation via neural network modeling and iterative information propagation. This paper presents our experiences in designing and implementing GPTE on top of the Spark, an emerging cluster computing framework. Extensive experiments are performed with real-world data input from Singapore's transport authority. Experimental results show that GPTE achieves as high as 88 percent accuracy in traffic estimation and up to 8× performance gain in computation efficiency with the optimization techniques applied. Comparison study demonstrates that GPTE outperforms the baseline solutions by 34 percent on accuracy and 46 percent on processing time.},
