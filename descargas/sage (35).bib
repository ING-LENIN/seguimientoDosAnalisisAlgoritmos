N2 - Psychiatric research is undergoing significant advances in an emerging subspeciality of computational psychiatry, building on cognitive neuroscience research by expanding to neurocomputational modeling. Here, we illustrate some research trends in this domain using work on proactive cognitive control deficits in schizophrenia as an example. We provide a selective review of formal modeling approaches to understanding cognitive control deficits in psychopathology, focusing primarily on biologically plausible connectionist-level models as well as mathematical models that generate parameter estimates of putatively dissociable psychological or neural processes. We illustrate some of the advantages of these models in terms of understanding both cognitive control deficits in schizophrenia and the potential roles of effort and motivation. Further, we highlight critical future directions for this work, including a focus on establishing psychometric properties, additional work modeling psychotic symptoms and their interaction with cognitive control, and the need to expand both behavioral and neural modeling to samples that include individuals with different mental health conditions, allowing for the examination of dissociable neural or psychological substrates for seemingly similar cognitive impairments across disorders.

N2 - Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) etiopathogenesis remains partially unexplained. The main conceptual framework used to study AD is the Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis, although the failure of recent clinical experimentation seems to reduce its potential in AD research. Objective: A possible explanation for the failure of clinical trials is that they are set too late in AD progression. Recent studies suggest that the ventral tegmental area (VTA) degeneration could be one of the first events occurring in AD progression (pre-plaque stage). Methods: Here we investigate this hypothesis through a computational model and computer simulations validated with behavioral and neural data from patients. Results: We show that VTA degeneration might lead to system-level adjustments of catecholamine release, triggering a sequence of events leading to relevant clinical and pathological signs of AD. These changes consist first in a midfrontal-driven compensatory hyperactivation of both VTA and locus coeruleus (norepinephrine) followed, with the progression of the VTA impairment, by a downregulation of catecholamine release. These processes could then trigger the neural degeneration at the cortical and hippocampal levels, due to the chronic loss of the neuroprotective role of norepinephrine. Conclusion: Our novel hypothesis might contribute to the formulation of a wider system-level view of AD which might help to devise early diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.

N2 - The size and variation in both meaning-making and populations that characterize much contemporary text data demand research processes that support both discovery, interpretation and measurement. We assess one dominant strategy within the social sciences that takes a computer-led approach to text analysis. The approach is coined computational grounded theory. This strategy, we argue, relies on a set of unwarranted assumptions, namely, that unsupervised models return natural clusters of meaning, that the researcher can understand text with limited immersion and that indirect validation is sufficient for ensuring unbiased and precise measurement. In response to this criticism, we develop a framework that is computer assisted. We argue that our reformulation of computational grounded theory better aligns with the principles within grounded theory, anthropological theory generation and ethnography.

N2 - Recent neuroscientific evidence in human and non-human primates indicates that the regions that become active during motor execution and motor observation overlap extensively in the cerebral cortex. This suggests that to observe an action, these primates employ their motor and somatosensation areas in order to simulate it internally. In line with this finding, in the current paper, we examine relevant neuroscientific evidence in order to design a computational agent that can facilitate observational learning of reaching movements. For this reason, we develop a novel motor control system, inspired from contemporary theories of motor control, and demonstrate how it can be used during observation to facilitate learning, without the active involvement of the agent’s body. Our results show that novel motor skills can be acquired only by observation, by optimizing the peripheral components of the agent’s motion.

N2 - This paper describes a computational model of optical flow and demonstrates how it can be used to estimate the navigation velocity of the user’s viewpoint during a virtual reality (VR) simulation. The model takes as input a VR simulation video sequence and outputs the estimated average navigation velocity. When this estimated velocity is integrated into the published cybersickness dose value model (CSDV: So, 1999), the severity level of the cybersickness associated with the VR simulation can be predicted. Results of two simulation studies indicated that the average navigation velocities in lateral and vertical axes can be estimated to within 10% error. The simulations used a virtual environment (VE) with a known single depth. Discussion of an extension of the computational model to accommodate VEs with unknown multiple depths is included. The reported model is consistent with the biological neuro-pathway of the perception of visual motion velocities in humans. The benefits associated with this consistency are discussed.

N2 - The purpose of the study was to compare the deficit profiles of two important types of mathematics difficulties. Three cognitive measures (working memory, processing speed, and reasoning), two mathematics measures (numerical facts retrieval and mathematics vocabulary), and reading comprehension were assessed among 237 Chinese fourth-grade students, among whom 28 were classified as students with only computational difficulties (CD), 34 were classified as having only word problem-solving difficulties (WPD), 20 were classified as students with computational and word problem-solving difficulties (CD + WPD), and 43 typically developing (TD) peers. Multivariate analysis showed that, compared with TD, CD was associated with weakness in numerical working memory; WPD was associated with weakness in reading comprehension; both CD and WPD were associated with weakness in mathematics vocabulary. However, CD and WPD did not differ from each other on any of those profiling measures. Implications for understanding mathematics competence and identification of mathematics difficulties are discussed.

N2 - Corrosion greatly affects the integrity of many engineering structures, such as bridges, pipelines, nuclear reactors, and aircraft. This study provides an overview of the computational intelligence methods developed for the corrosion damage assessment of aerospace materials and structures. Specifically, cellular automata modeling of corrosion pit initiation and growth, wavelet based image processing methods for corrosion damage assessment, and artificial neural networks (ANNs) for material loss and residual strength predictions. In addition, ANN based prediction of life due to corrosion-fatigue conditions are considered and presented. Results obtained from selected computational intelligence methods are compared to the existing alternate solutions and experimental data. The results presented illustrate the feasibility of computational intelligence methods for modeling and assessing the corrosion health of aging aircraft structures and materials.
