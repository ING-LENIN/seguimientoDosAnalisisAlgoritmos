N2 - Parabolic trough solar collectors (PTSCs) are commonly used in solar thermal implementations to achieve high-temperatures. The current investigation looks at entropy formation and the effect of nano solid particles on a parabolic trough surface collector (PTSC) mounted aboard a solar-powered ship (SPS). The non-Newtonian first grade viscoelastic type, as well as a porous medium and Darcy-Forchheimer effects, were utilised in the current study. The flowing of PTSC was created by a non-linear stretching sheet, and the changing thermal conductivity, heat source, and viscous dissipation effects were used to calculate the heat flux in the thermal boundary layer. To convert partial differential equations (PDEs) into solvable ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with boundary-constraints, a similarity transformation strategy was used. The boundary-constraints and PDEs have been reduced to a set of non-linear ODEs (ordinary differential equations). To reach the approximated solution of ODEs, the Galerkin finite element method (G-FEM) is used. As working fluids, copper-sodium alginate (Cu-SA) and molybdenum disulfide-copper/sodium alginate (MoS2-Cu/SA) hybrid nanofluids were used. According to the findings, the permeability factor diminished the Nusselt number whilst boosting the skin friction factor. Furthermore, overall entropy variance throughout the domain was increased for flow speeds using the Reynolds number, and viscosity changes were tracked using the Brinkman number. When compared to MoS2-Cu/SA, using Cu-SA nanofluid boosted thermal efficiency by 1.3–18.8%.

N2 - In this paper, a bibliometric study on the interconnections between the fuzzy logic theory field and the other soft-computing techniques is presented. Bibliometric maps showing the associations between the main concepts between these research fields are provided for the periods 1990–1999, 2000–2003, and 2004–2007. The maps provide insight into the structure of these fields. They visualize the division of the field into several subfields and they indicate the relations between these subfields. The maps are created by co-word analysis. Experts can use these maps to forecast emerging trends for hybrid intelligent systems.

N2 - In early phases of design a wide exploration of the design space is crucial to the development of creative solutions. In this regard, Evolutionary Computation (EC), and in particular Genetic Algorithms, contain several qualities that can enhance exploration by opening the search process beyond the focus of finding a single “best” solution. Over the years many researchers in the area of creative thinking including Gordon, de Bono, Parnes, Osborn and others, have suggested design strategies that have interesting parallels in EC processes. For instance, a well known inhibitor of creative thinking is design fixation, where the suggestion of a particular solution makes it difficult to imagine other good solutions. Unlike many other computational search algorithms, EC methods work with populations of “fairly good” solutions. Therefore, there is less danger that creativity will be harmed by design fixation on one “best” solution. This paper shows through a specific example of a truss bridge how an EC based design exploration program can aid the designer by providing a selection of “pretty good” solutions rather than a single optimal solution. Other aspects of the EC program are also discussed including drawbacks to the method such as computational intensity as well as directions of future development.

N2 - Widespread availability of electronic health records coupled with sophisticated statistical methods offer great potential for a variety of applications for health and disease surveillance, developing predictive models and advancing decision support for clinicians. However, use of “big data” mining and discovery techniques has also raised ethical issues such as how to balance privacy and autonomy with the wider public benefits of data sharing. Furthermore, electronic data are being increasingly used to identify individual characteristics, which can be useful for clinical prediction and management, but were not previously disclosed to a clinician. This process in computer parlance is called electronic phenotyping, and has a number of ethical implications. Using the Belmont Report’s principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice as a framework, we examined the ethical issues posed by electronic phenotyping. Ethical issues identified include the ability of the patient to consent for the use of their information, the ability to suppress pediatric information, ensuring that the potential benefits justify the risks of harm to patients, and acknowledging that the clinician’s biases or stereotypes, conscious or unintended, may become a factor in the therapeutic interaction. We illustrate these issues with two vignettes, using the person characteristic of gender minority status (i.e., transgender identity) and health history characteristic of substance abuse. Data mining has the potential to uncover patient characteristics previously obscured, which can provide clinicians with beneficial clinical information. Hence, ethical guidelines must be updated to ensure that electronic phenotyping supports the principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice.

N2 - There are over 70 low energy and carbon standards in use around the world. None of these standards have been designed by the clients who pay for and occupy the buildings in question. In this work, the client was asked to define the building code for the construction of a new 2800 m2 building via a structured survey. The resulting zero-energy standard simply required the building to incur no energy utility bill. One year of monitoring of the completed building was used to see if the standard had been met. The result of this work is a new way of thinking about environmental building standards that solves many of the issues of obtaining and maintaining buy-in from the client. Practical application: This is the first time that the client has played a key role in the definition of a low-energy building standard. Measured energy consumption and renewable energy generation data are presented and demonstrate that the zero-energy criteria were successfully met. This work is important as it shows that the client can have a meaningful input into the design of an environmental standard. The paper should be of interest to architects, engineers, building energy researchers and those interested in methods that can be used to reduce the energy demand of buildings.

N2 - Calculating math problems from memory may seem unrelated to everyday processing of emotions, but they have more in common than one might think. Prior research highlights the importance of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in executive control, intentional emotion regulation, and experience of dysfunctional mood and anxiety. Although it has been hypothesized that emotion regulation may be related to “cold” (i.e., not emotion-related) executive control, this assertion has not been tested. We address this gap by providing evidence that greater dlPFC activity during cold executive control is associated with increased use of cognitive reappraisal to regulate emotions in everyday life. We then demonstrate that in the presence of increased life stress, increased dlPFC activity is associated with lower mood and anxiety symptoms and clinical diagnoses. Collectively, our results encourage ongoing efforts to understand prefrontal executive control as a possible intervention target for improving emotion regulation in mood and anxiety disorders.

N2 - Serious games are a growing field in academic research and they are considered an effective tool for education. Game-based learning invokes motivation and engagement in students resulting in effective instructional outcomes. An essential aspect of a serious game is the method of support for presenting the teaching material and providing feedback. A support design that evaluates students’ progress and adapts accordingly, has the potential of producing better learning results. This paper presents an adaptive model based on fuzzy logic that adjusts the support acquisition according to student knowledge level. A serious game for teaching the concepts of sequence and iteration in programming to novice students was built to assess the model. It employs working examples as a support method since previous research indicated that it produced less cognitive load during problem-solving. An empirical study with 102 students has been conducted to evaluate the learning efficiency of the model. The analysis indicates positive results and a potential solution for balancing the amount of assistance in serious games.

N2 - Becoming proficient in scientific discourse such as argumentation or developing explanations can be challenging for students, including neurodivergent students (e.g., autistic students, students with learning disabilities, students with ADHD). Students need to practice developing arguments and explanations as well as sharing their conclusions with others; however, these opportunities do not regularly occur. The use of multimedia technology shows promise in being an engaging and effective way to support student learning and discussion of science topics and phenomena. This study investigated the use of a multimedia presentation called Dialogic Instruction for Argumentative Learning in Science (DIALS) in supporting upper-elementary neurodivergent students to provide complete responses to science questions. DIALS provides a structured inquiry investigation to the student in which they learn about a phenomenon through completing scaffolded animated experiments, explicitly learning how to develop an argument and respond to others conclusions, and learning relevant content information to support their argument and explanation development. An adapted alternating treatments design approach was used in this study. The phenomena explored were counterbalanced between three options: DIALS, PowerPoint comparison lessons, or control probe slides. Results from this study show promise in the use of DIALS in enhancing student complete responding to questions and providing quality claims for why they think phenomena occur. Implications for the findings are discussed.

N2 - Hashtag campaigns calling out sexual violence and rape myths offer a unique context for disclosing sexual victimization on social media. This study investigates the applicability of adaptive self-reflection as a potential self-effect from such public disclosures of unreported sexual victimization experiences by analyzing 92,583 tweets that invoked #WhyIDidntReport. A supervised machine learning classifier determined that 61.8% of the tweets were self-disclosures of sexual victimization. Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) analysis showed statistically significant differences in four psycholinguistic dimensions (greater use of past focus, cognitive processes, insight, and causation words) connected with reflective processing in tweets with self-disclosed sexual victimization compared to those without. Additionally, topic modeling and thematic analysis identified nine salient topics within the self-disclosing tweets, comprising three self-distanced representations (i.e., relatively abstract and insightful construals) of the unwanted experiences: (a) acknowledging one’s previously unacknowledged victimization, (b) reaffirming one’s rationale for not reporting, and (c) decrying invalidating response to one’s disclosure. Moving beyond reception effects and social support in extant research about social media as a coping tool, this study provides new empirical insights into the potential of social media to promote expressive meaning-making of upsetting and traumatic experiences in ways that support recovery and resilience.
