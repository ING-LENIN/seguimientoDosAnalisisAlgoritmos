N2 - This article highlights the ‘synergistic’ use of experimental fluid dynamics (EFD) and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), where the two sets of simulations are performed concurrently and by the same researcher. In particular, examples from the area of ground effect aerodynamics are discussed, where the major facility used was also designed through a combination of CFD and EFD. Three examples are than outlined, to demonstrate the insight that can be obtained from the integration of CFD and EFD studies. The case studies are the study of dimple flow (to enhance aerodynamic performance), the analysis of a Formula-style front wing and wheel, and the study of compressible flow ground effect aerodynamics. In many instances, CFD has been used to not only provide complementary information to an experimental study, but to design the experiments. Laser-based, non-intrusive experimental techniques were used to provide an excellent complement to CFD. The large datasets found from both experimental and numerical simulations have required a new methodology to correlate the information; a new post-processing method has been developed, making use of the kriging and co-kriging estimators, to develop correlations between the often disparate data types.

N2 - A number of toxic effects are brought about by the covalent interaction between the toxicant and biological macromolecules. In chemico assays are available that attempt to identify reactive compounds. These approaches have been developed independently for pharmaceuticals and for other non-pharmaceutical compounds. The assays vary widely in terms of the macromolecule (typically a peptide) and the analytical technique utilised. For both sets of methods, there are great opportunities to capture in chemico information by using in silico methods to provide computational tools for screening purposes. In order to use these in chemico and in silico methods, integrated testing strategies are required for individual toxicity endpoints. The potential for the use of these approaches is described, and a number of recommendations to improve this extremely useful technique, in terms of implementing the Three Rs in toxicity testing, are presented.

N2 - This study examines how the news framing of immigration influences the public’s feelings toward immigrants and their preference for immigration policy in the United States. Unlike prior experimental research that documents the respondents’ immediate reactions to several hand-crafted news frames, this study provides strong empirical evidence for the association between the respondents’ real-world news exposure and their opinion change over time. Combining a computational media content analysis and a two-wave panel survey, the research demonstrates that while exposure to certain frames in the mainstream media would directly lead to public support for a stricter immigration policy, partisan media tend to affect public opinion indirectly by influencing their feelings toward immigrants in opposite directions.

N2 - This paper is the second in a series implementing initial strain–energy-based thermo-elastoviscoplastic isotropic damage–self-healing formulations for bituminous composites to compare the model predictions with experimental measurements. Computational algorithms based on the two-step operator splitting methodology are systematically developed and employed for numerical simulations. The elastic damage self-healing predictor and the viscoplastic corrector coupled with the Arrhenius-type temperature term via the net stress concept in conjunction with the hypothesis of strain equivalence are entirely considered as numerical implementation of the models. Several numerical examples of one-dimensional driver problems are first presented to show the effect of temperature and rest period for healing. Experimental validation of the proposed formulations against monotonic constant–strain test under different temperatures and controlled-strain cyclic tension test is presented. Qualitative and quantitative agreement between experimental results and numerical simulations is also observed. In particular, the softening behavior of the bituminous materials is well predicted for monotonic constant–strain rate test. The viscous damage behavior can be reasonably captured by the proposed damage models with the Arrhenius-type temperature term and the step-by-step computational algorithms.

N2 - Although a wealth of studies on companies’ environmental behavior exists, little is known about the factors with the greatest influence on the evolution of such behavior. Thus, employing empirical data on China and an agent-based simulation model, this study examines the evolution from defensive to preventive environmental behavior. The results show that community support is the most important factor in this process, followed by managers’ environmental awareness and companies’ financial ability. However, financial ability is the most significant factor in the evolution from preventive to enthusiastic environmental behavior, followed by managers’ environmental awareness and community support. Our identification of the most important factors can serve as a basis for decision makers to focus on improving the operational effectiveness of environmental policies.

N2 - Abstract An experimentally validated numerical analysis of reciprocating refrigeration compressors is presented. The finite-volume methodology is adopted to solve the flow field and a one-degree-of-freedom model is used to describe the valve dynamics. The variation of the computation domain, associated with the valve and piston displacements, is taken into account and the time-dependent flow field and the valve dynamics are coupled and solved simultaneously. The three-dimensional formulation considered in the analysis allowed the simulation of actual suction and discharge muffler geometries. Numerical results were validated with reference to experimental data for valve displacement and pressure in the suction and compression chambers obtained in a calorimeter facility. A study was carried out to identify the contributions of mufflers and valves to the compressor thermodynamic losses.

N2 - Calcium silicate hydrate Jennite is a molecular structure commonly accepted as a representation of the complex calcium silicate hydrate gel formed during the hydration of typical Portland cement. In this paper, the behavior of nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite under shear deformation was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Computational samples representing the nanoscale structure of calcium silicate hydrate Jennite were subjected to shear deformation in order to investigate not only their mechanical properties but also their deformation behavior. The simulation results indicated that the nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite under shear deformation displays a linear elastic behavior up to shear stress of approximately 1.0 GPa, and shear deformation of about 0.08 radians, after which point yielding and plastic deformation occurs. The shear modulus determined from the simulations was 11.2 ± 0.7 GPa. The deformation-induced displacements in molecular structures were analyzed dividing the system in regions representing calcium oxide layers. The displacement/deformation of the layers of calcium oxide forming the structure of nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite was analyzed. The non-linear stress–strain behavior in the molecular structure was attributed to a non-linear increase in the displacement due to sliding of the calcium oxide layers on top of each other with higher shearing. These results support the idea that by controlling the chemical reactions, the tailored morphologies can be used to increase the interlinking between the calcium oxide layers, thus minimizing the shearing of the layers and leading to molecular structures that can withstand larger deformation and have improved failure behavior.

N2 - In the present work, effects of nozzle hole size and rail pressure under non-evaporating spray condition are demonstrated. Three single hole injectors with the bore size of 0.101, 0.122, and 0.133 mm are experimented with injection pressures of 140, 45, and 38 MPa respectively to achieve similar injection rate profile. Diesel spray experiments implement Diffused Backlight Illumination Technique where diffused background is obtained for the High Speed Video camera imaging. Experimental results are then validated with computational and analytical studies. The CFD simulation requires the injection rate profile and spray cone angle as a primary input; thus, based on the High Speed Video Camera start of injection frame the 5 kHz Butterworth low-pass frequency filter is applied to the injection rate raw data. While, the spray cone angle is predicted using a simple model obtained from the relationship between the injection velocity, fluctuating velocity at the nozzle exit and total pressure loss factor of the injector. The experimental spray tip penetration of all three injectors is almost identical as the similar injection rate profile is adopted. Although, the mixture characteristics are better for 0.101 mm hole diameter since the smaller hole diameter with highest injection pressure depicts larger spray angle and better atomization. The computational study agrees with experiments qualitatively; however, the quantitative and qualitative agreements are seen in the analytical study.

N2 - A CFD-based assessment and validation of the NREL Phase-VI Sequence-S rotor at seven wind speeds presented here. The ability of a three-dimensional, unstructured, unsteady RANS solver in successfully predicting the wind flow interactions with a rotating, twisted and tapered rotor is described. The uRANS equations were coupled with SST κ-ω turbulence model and a correlation-based Gamma-Theta transition model. The simulations were performed in ANSYS CFX using both Single Reference Frame (SRF) and Multiple Reference Frame (MRF) modelling approaches. A good agreement with measurements is observed at six of seven wind speeds when comparing the integral quantities, the spanwise and chordwise distributions. The only exception is the 10 m/s wind speed case, attributed to the onset of a massive leading edge stall around the mid-span region. It is successfully demonstrated here how uRANS-based CFD computations can be effectively employed in the study of wind turbine rotor aerodynamics.
