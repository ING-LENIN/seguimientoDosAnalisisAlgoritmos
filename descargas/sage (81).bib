abstract = {A stable liquid/liquid optical waveguide (LLW) was formed using a sheath flow, where a 15% sodium chloride (NaCl) solution functioned as the core solution and water functioned as the cladding solution (15% NaCl/water LLW). The LLW was at least 200 mm in length. The concentration distributions of the liquid core and liquid cladding solutions in the LLW system were predicted by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to validate the characteristics of the waveguide. The broadening of the region of the fluorescence of Rhodamine B excited by the guided light and the increase in the critical angle of the guided light with the increase in the contact time of the core and the cladding solutions were well explained by CFD calculations. However, no substantial leakage of the guided light was observed despite the considerably large change in the refractive index profile of the LLW; thus, a narrower and longer waveguide was realized.}

abstract = {Most computational problems for matrix semigroups and groups are inherently difficult to solve and even undecidable starting from dimension three. The questions about the decidability and complexity of problems for two-dimensional matrix semigroups remain open and are directly linked with other challenging problems in the field. In this paper we study the computational complexity of the problem of determining whether the identity matrix belongs to a matrix semigroup (the Identity Problem) generated by a finite set of 2 × 2 integral unimodular matrices. The Identity Problem for matrix semigroups is a well-known challenging problem, which has remained open in any dimension until recently. It is currently known that the problem is decidable in dimension two and undecidable starting from dimension four. In particular, we show that the Identity Problem for 2 × 2 integral unimodular matrices is NP-hard by a reduction of the Subset Sum Problem and several new encoding techniques. An upper bound for the nontrivial decidability result by C. Choffrut and J. Karhumäki is unknown. However, we derive a lower bound on the minimum length solution to the Identity Problem for a constructible set of instances, which is exponential in the number of matrices of the generator set and the maximal element of the matrices. This shows that the most obvious candidate for an NP algorithm, which is to guess the shortest sequence of matrices which multiply to give the identity matrix, does not work correctly since the certificate would have a length which is exponential in the size of the instance. Both results lead to a number of corollaries confirming the same bounds for vector reachability, scalar reachability and zero in the right upper corner problems.}

abstract = {In the conveying process of a solid–liquid two-phase medium, the wear of the flow passage components is unavoidable. In this study, the solid–liquid two-phase flow in a centrifugal pump was numerically simulated by computational fluid dynamics–discrete element method coupling. For particle diameters up to 3 mm, the particle–particle and particle–wall interactions were considered in the simulation. Two-phase performance and wear experiments for different flow rates and particle concentrations were conducted. The wear experiment was carried out for 48 h at each mass concentration. In these experiments, a paint film method was used to display the wear position, and the wall thickness of the flow passage was measured using an ultrasonic thickness gauge. The results show that the instantaneous wear rate of the impeller, volute, and wear plate in the pump changed periodically with the impeller rotation. The volute wall wear was related to the particle movement. With the increase in the particle mass concentration, the wear rate increased. However, the rate of increase of the wear rate decreased because the particles moved to the wall in the volute to form a particle layer. Increasing the concentration did not linearly increase the effect of the particles on the wall.}

abstract = {Abstract A multi-body computational model of the human head and neck was previously shown to be in good agreement with experimental findings from actual human cervical spine specimens. The model segments were tested in three directions of loading showing main and coupled motions to be accurate and realistic. The model’s ability to predict the dynamic response of the head and neck, when subjected to acceleration pulses representing frontal, lateral, and rear-end impacts, is verified using experimental data derived from sled acceleration tests with human volunteers for 15 g frontal and 7 g lateral impacts and from isolated cervical spine specimen tests for rear-end impacts. Response corridors based on sled acceleration tests with human volunteers for frontal and lateral impacts are used to evaluate the model and investigate the effect of muscle activation on the head-neck motion. Firstly, the impacts are simulated with both passive and active muscle behaviour. Secondly, the local loads in the soft-tissue elements during the frontal impact are analysed. For rear-end impact simulation experiments using ligamentous isolated cervical spine specimens are used to evaluate the model performance before investigating the effects of muscle tensioning. Good agreement with human volunteer response corridors resulting from frontal and lateral impacts, and isolated cervical spine specimen sled test rear-end impact experiments is demonstrated for the model, highlighting the important role the muscles of the neck play in the head-neck response to acceleration impacts. The model is shown to be able to predict the loads and deformations of the cervical spine components making it suitable for injury analysis.}

abstract = {In a crosswind scenario, the risk of high-speed trains overturning increases when they run on viaducts since the aerodynamic loads are higher than on the ground. In order to increase safety, vehicles are sheltered by fences that are installed on the viaduct to reduce the loads experienced by the train. Windbreaks can be designed to have different heights, and with or without eaves on the top. In this paper, a parametric study with a total of 12 fence designs was carried out using a two-dimensional model of a train standing on a viaduct. To asses the relative effectiveness of sheltering devices, tests were done in a wind tunnel with a scaled model at a Reynolds number of 1 × 105, and the train’s aerodynamic coefficients were measured. Experimental results were compared with those predicted by Unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) simulations of flow, showing that a computational model is able to satisfactorily predict the trend of the aerodynamic coefficients. In a second set of tests, the Reynolds number was increased to 12 × 106 (at a free flow air velocity of 30 m/s) in order to simulate strong wind conditions. The aerodynamic coefficients showed a similar trend for both Reynolds numbers; however, their numerical value changed enough to indicate that simulations at the lower Reynolds number do not provide all required information. Furthermore, the variation of coefficients in the simulations allowed an explanation of how fences modified the flow around the vehicle to be proposed. This made it clear why increasing fence height reduced all the coefficients but adding an eave had an effect mainly on the lift force coefficient. Finally, by analysing the time signals it was possible to clarify the influence of the Reynolds number on the peak-to-peak amplitude, the time period and the Strouhal number.}
