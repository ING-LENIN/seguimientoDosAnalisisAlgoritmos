N2 - How does media coverage of electoral campaigns distinguish parties and candidates in emerging democracies? To answer, we present a multi-step procedure that we apply in South Africa. First, we develop a theoretically informed classification of election coverage as either “narrow” or “broad” from within the entire corpus of news coverage during an electoral campaign. Second, to deploy our classification scheme, we use a supervised machine learning approach to classify news as “broad,” “narrow,” or “not election-related.” Finally, we combine our supervised classification with a topic modeling algorithm (BERTTopic) that is based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), in addition to other statistical and machine learning methods. The combination of our classification scheme, BERTTopic, and associated methods allows us to identify the main election-related themes among broad and narrow election-related coverage, and how different candidates and parties are associated with these themes. We provide an in-depth discussion of our method for interested users in the social sciences. We then apply our proposed techniques on text from nearly 100,000 news articles during South Africa’s 2014 campaign and test our empirical predictions about candidate and party coverage of corruption, the economy, health, public infrastructure, and security. The application of our method highlights a nuanced campaign environment in South Africa; candidates and parties frequently receive distinct and substantive coverage on key campaign themes.

N2 - Detection of damage in vital and high-cost infrastructures has been one of the major concerns of operators of such structures in the past two decades. The growing demands in oil and gas have forced extraction of such vital fuels in deep waters. Bolted joints are widely used in pipes transporting oil and gas in deep waters. However, they do develop in-service problems, such as loosened bolts, which if remained undetected, could cause significant environmental damage and economical loss, especially in the case of pipes used in deep-water oil extraction. In this study, the energy damage index (EDI) calculated based on a novel vibration-based damage detection methodology using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is used to establish the existence of damage due to loosened bolts in common industrial bolted joints. A complete finite element (FE) model is established to simulate the whole process using the implicit dynamic solver of the commercial software ABAQUS©. Also, a comprehensive experimental program was designed and carried out to verify the FE results. Results show that the EDI based on the EMD method is a powerful tool for not only detecting the damage, but also the progression of the damage in bolted joints.

N2 - Human reasoning and creativity represent perhaps the two highest evolutionary reaches of cognition. These two capacities are distinct from each other, but research on creativity in analogical reasoning has identified a point of convergence between them at one of the farthest forward and most recently evolved reaches of the brain. Analogy is a form of relational cognition because analogies form connections that relate otherwise separate concepts. Quantitative tools for measuring the semantic distance between concepts have advanced the measurement of creativity in relational cognition (more creative relational cognition forms connections across greater semantic distance). These tools are especially useful for the emerging neuroscience of creativity. I describe this semantic-distance approach and how it is being leveraged in my laboratory and elsewhere to investigate not only differences in creative ability between individuals but also creativity as a dynamic state that varies across time within an individual.

N2 - Mass adoption of advanced information technologies is fueling a need for public servants with the skills to manage data-driven public agencies. Public employees typically acquire data skills through graduate research methods courses, which focus primarily on research design and statistical analysis. What data skills are currently taught, and what content should Master of Public Administration (MPA) programs include in their research method courses? We categorized research method course content in 52 syllabi from 31 MPA programs to understand how data skills are taught in public administration. We find that most graduate programs rely on research methods more suited for academic and policy research while lacking the data skills needed to modernize public agencies. Informed by these results, this work presents the Data Science Literacy Framework as a guide for assessing and planning curriculum within MPA programs.

N2 - 2,2-Dinitroethene-1,1-diamine (FOX-7) was studied by means of electrospray ionization (ESI) and chemical ionization (CI) mass spectrometry in both positive and negative ion mode. Detailed mechanisms of unimolecular fragmentations of protonated and deprotonated FOX-7 were investigated using high- and low-energy collision-induced dissociation (CID) mass spectrometry, neutral fragment reionization mass spectrometry and quantum chemistry calculations. In deprotonated FOX-7, elimination of the carbodiimide molecule was identified as the energetically most favored fragmentation channel, closely resembling the base hydrolysis of FOX-7. The dinitromethanide ion is formed during this fragmentation as revealed by comparison with CID mass spectra of an isobaric ion prepared by the ESI of authentic sodium dinitromethanide. The proton affinity of FOX-7 was estimated as 855 kJ mol−1 by high-accuracy quantum chemistry calculations. This value corresponds to protonation at the C-2 position, though the oxygen-protonated tautomer was found to be nearly isoenergetic in the gas phase. In acetonitrile, the nitro group-protonated FOX-7 was found to be significantly less stable then its C-2 tautomer. These theoretical findings are clearly reflected in differences in fragmentations of ESI- and CI-generated [M + H]+ ions. Interestingly, the consecutive losses of OH• and NO2• radicals instead of a whole HNO3 molecule were found to account for the most abundant fragment ion in the positive ESI CID mass spectra. In the CI-generated [M + H]+ and [M+D]+ ions, substantial internal energy effects upon the CID were observed.

N2 - To evaluate the dispersion of a heavy gas, such as sulphur hexafluoride, with a low Froude number in a built environment, an experimental and numerical simulation study was conducted. The experiment was carried out using seven different injection inlet configurations in an experimental chamber. The release rate was found to have a great effect on the concentration in the lower part of the chamber. The obstacle in the middle of the chamber could cause a non-uniform distribution of concentration, particularly due to variations in locations and angles of the release outlets. Additionally, numerical simulations were carried out to evaluate four turbulence models: the standard k-ε model, the realizable k-ε model, the re-normalization group (RNG) k-ε model and the shear stress transport (SST) k-ω model. Four indicators were used to evaluate the turbulent model performance. In general, the SST k-ω model performed the best, with geometric mean bias (MG) = 0.968 and geometric variance (VG) = 1.09 at 0.055 m height, and with MG = 0.384 and VG = 2.80 at 0.6 m height. The standard k-ε model was the next best in performance, followed by the realizable k-ε and the RNG k-ε model.
