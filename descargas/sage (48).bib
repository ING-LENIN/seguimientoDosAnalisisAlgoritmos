N2 - All operations in process metallurgy involve complex phenomena comprising momentum, heat, and/or mass transport; iron- and steelmaking is not an exception. Transport phenomena, i.e. fluid flows, heat transfer and mass transfer, play a dominant role in process metallurgy since their respective laws govern the kinetics of the various physical phenomena occurring in ironmaking and in steelmaking. These phenomena include such events as three-phase reactions, entrainment of slag and gas in liquid steel, vacuum degassing, alloy melting and mixing, the movements and flotation of inclusions, melt temperature losses, residence times in a metallurgical reactor, erosion of refractory linings, etc. In all these aspects, the evolution in our techniques and abilities to model single and multiphase flows and their attendant heat and mass transfer processes has contributed significantly to our understanding and effectively operating these processes, to designing improvements, and to developing new processes. To be ignorant of these matters can doom a processing operation to the scrap heap of metallurgical failures. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and computational heat and mass transfer has been a very effective tool over the last three decades, for modelling iron- and steelmaking processes, starting from the blast furnace up to continuous casting and beyond. With the advent of commercial CFD packages and ever increasing computational power through parallel processing, CFD has now become the dominant approach for predicting various aspects in iron- and steelmaking processes. In Part 1 of this review paper, the applications of CFD in ironmaking processes are thoroughly reviewed, discussed and critiqued. In Part 2, fluid flows and CFD in steelmaking and steel casting processes are similarly reviewed and critiqued.

N2 - Background Past studies reported a low correlation between rhinomanometry and computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but the source of the discrepancy was unclear. Low correlation or lack of correlation has also been reported between subjective and objective measures of nasal patency. Objective: This study investigates (1) the correlation and agreement between nasal resistance derived from CFD (RCFD) and rhinomanometry (RRMN), and (2) the correlation between objective and subjective measures of nasal patency. Methods Twenty-five patients with nasal obstruction underwent anterior rhinomanometry before and after mucosal decongestion with oxymetazoline. Subjective nasal patency was assessed with a 0-10 visual analog scale (VAS). CFD simulations were performed based on computed tomography scans obtained after mucosal decongestion. To validate the CFD methods, nasal resistance was measured in vitro (REXPERIMENT) by performing pressure-flow experiments in anatomically accurate plastic nasal replicas from 6 individuals. Results Mucosal decongestion was associated with a reduction in bilateral nasal resistance (0.34 ± 0.23 Pa.s/ml to 0.19 ± 0.24 Pa.s/ml, p = 0.003) and improved sensation of nasal airflow (bilateral VAS decreased from 5.2 ± 1.9 to 2.6 ± 1.9, p < 0.001). A statistically significant correlation was found between VAS in the most obstructed cavity and unilateral airflow before and after mucosal decongestion (r = −0.42, p = 0.003). Excellent correlation was found between RCFD and REXPERIMENT (r = 0.96, p < 0.001) with good agreement between the numerical and in vitro values (RCFD/REXPERIMENT = 0.93 ± 0.08). A weak correlation was found between RCFD and RRMN (r = 0.41, p = 0.003) with CFD underpredicting nasal resistance derived from rhinomanometry (RCFD/RRMN = 0.65 ± 0.63). A stronger correlation was found when unilateral airflow at a pressure drop of 75 Pa was used to compare CFD with rhinomanometry (r = 0.76, p < 0.001). Conclusion CFD and rhinomanometry are moderately correlated, but CFD underpredicts nasal resistance measured in vivo due in part to the assumption of rigid nasal walls. Our results confirm previous reports that subjective nasal patency correlates better with unilateral than with bilateral measurements and in the context of an intervention.

N2 - The versatility and application of Intelligent Multi-Agent Systems (I-MASs) is becoming more complex. The increase in complexity is due to a sudden requirement for Intelligent Agents (IAs) and I-MASs to exhibit more human-like functionality. This includes the ability to represent knowledge using perception, learning, recognition, reasoning and rationality. In addition, this ``wishlist’’ of functionality also needs to be constrained within the limits of current technology. Designers of I-MASs are looking at mechanisms and processes that can satisfy more involved requirements. Two such paradigms are cognitive architectures and computational intelligence. The Agent Coordination and Cooperation Cognitive Model (AC3M) was developed to primarily illustrate the link between agent coordination and cooperation. Whilst analysing AC3M, the Stimulate-Orient-Decide-Act (SODA) methodology was discovered. This methodology is a result of integrating cognitive architecture principles with computational intelligence. SODA was the integration of the Belief, Desire and Intention (BDI) methodology with the Observe-Orient-Decide-Act (OODA) loop and results in the components of BDI being linked to phases of the OODA loop. The main advantage of the SODA methodology is the enhancement of an agent’s situational awareness, which has proven to be paramount in the area of team automation.

N2 - As part of a recent animal facility refurbishment, a cubicle containment system was designed to increase the amount of experimental space and also provide containment facilities to support the holding and use of specialized animal models. In order to achieve this, a series of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) studies was undertaken to evaluate the effects of different airflows and in order to optimize ventilation, a variety of exhaust/supply arrangements and animal loads was employed. These studies showed that air delivered via two, opposed, low level ducts, at a rate of 20 air changes per hour and exhausted high in the cubicle above the rack, was the optimal configuration resulting in minimal turbulence, stagnation and entrainment.

N2 - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of the most important diagnostic tools in modern medicine. Since it is a high-cost and highly-complex imaging modality, computational models are frequently built to enhance its understanding as well as to support further development. However, such models often have to be simplified to complete simulations in a reasonable time. Thus, the simulations with high spatial/temporal resolutions, with any motion consideration (like blood flow) and/or with 3D objects usually call for using parallel computing environments. In this paper, we propose to use graphics processing units (GPUs) for fast simulations of MRI of vascular structures. We apply a CUDA environment which supports general purpose computation on GPU (GPGPU). The data decomposition strategy is applied and thus the parts of each virtual object are spread over the GPU cores. The GPU cores are responsible for calculating the influence of blood flow behavior and MRI events after successive time steps. In the proposed approach, different data layouts, memory access patterns, and other memory improvements are applied to efficiently exploit GPU resources. Computational performance is thoroughly validated for various vascular structures and different NVIDIA GPUs. Results show that MRI simulations can be accelerated significantly thanks to GPGPU. The proposed GPU-based approach may be easily adopted in the modeling of other flow related phenomena like perfusion, diffusion or transport of contrast agents.

N2 - The concept of ‘digital phenotyping’ was originally developed by researchers in the mental health field, but it has travelled to other disciplines and areas. This commentary draws upon our experiences of working in two scientific projects that are based at the University of Oxford’s Big Data Institute – The RADAR-AD project and The Minerva Initiative – which are developing algorithmic phenotyping technologies. We describe and analyse the concepts of digital biomarkers and computational phenotyping that underlie these projects, explain how they are linked to other research in digital phenotyping and compare and contrast some of their epistemological and ethical implications. In particular, we argue that the phenotyping paradigm in both projects is grounded on an assumption of ‘objectivity’ that is articulated in different ways depending on the role that is given to the computational/digital tools. Using the concept of ‘affordance’, we show how specific functionalities relate to potential uses and social implications of these technologies and argue that it is important to distinguish among them as the concept of digital phenotyping is increasingly being used with a variety of meanings.

N2 - To encourage the use of computational modeling in organizational behavior research, an example computational model is developed and rigorous tests of it presented. Specifically, a computational model based on control theory was created to test the theory’s explanation of the goal-level effect (e.g., higher goals lead to higher performance). Data from simulations of the model were compared with the behavior of 32 undergraduate students performing a scheduling task under various within-subject manipulations and across time. Correlational analyses indicated that the model accounted for most of the participants’data, with coefficients between the model and each participant’s behavior mostly in the high 90s.

N2 - Most manganese used in the world is consumed as ferroalloys by the steelmaking industry. Submerged arc electric furnace smelting using the manganese-rich slag method is widely used to produce ferromanganese. This process has been modelled using the HSC computational thermodynamics package. It was assumed that higher manganese and iron oxides are reduced to MnO and FeO before entering the zone where molten slag and alloy form and equilibrate. The model predictions were compared to data from Thermit Alloys (P) Limited, an Indian ferroalloy smelter, and the agreement was found to be good. It was then used to examine the affects of changing the amount of carbon reductant and temperature on several performance indicators. The results of this modelling are discussed and it is concluded that the model is useful as an aid to understanding ferromanganese smelting.

N2 - This paper reports our research concerning dialogue strategies suitable for adoption by a human–computer debating system. We propose a set of strategic heuristics for a computer to adopt to enable it to function as a dialogue participant. In particular, we consider means of assessing the proposed strategy. A system involving two agents in dialogue with each other and a human–agent debate system are constructed and subsequently used to facilitate the evaluations. The evaluations suggest that the proposed strategy can enable the computer to act as an effective dialogue participant. It is anticipated that this work will contribute towards the development of computerised dialogue systems and help to illuminate research issues concerning strategies in dialectical systems.
