  abstract={Computational literacies are becoming increasingly necessary for full societal participation. This paper investigates how Latine and multilingual students leverage their linguistic and cultural resources to develop coding and literacy skills. Data included interviews with Latine and multilingual students, teacher interviews, and teacher co-design meeting notes. Results showed that students learned coding and language through their families and communities, leveraged their cultural knowledge of storytelling to engage in computing, and built self-efficacy through peer support. Findings from this pilot study shed light on how to mobilize Latine and multilingual students’ rich languages and cultures for equitable computer science learning.},

  abstract={With the rapid development of global supply chain, the existing methodology and solution struggle to cope with the operation of complex logistics systems (CLS). Thereupon, the computational logistics is suggested systematically from the perspectives of definition evolution, conceptual architecture, problem-oriented exploration, and practical philosophy. All provide an elementary sketch and synopsis of CLS oriented scheduling and decision methodology. Subsequently, a typical application of computational logistics is discussed on a container terminal handling system (CTHS). After the abstraction and automation of container terminal-oriented logistics generalized computation, the memory access model and computing principles in computer science are transferred and integrated to propose the yard facility-block accessing and switching model (YFB-ASM). The processor affinity, spatial locality and cooperative computing of CTHS are discussed according to the practice data in a large-scale CTHS. The YFB-ASM is supposed to establish a solid foundation for rolling plan, task scheduling, resource allocation and performance analysis of CTHS. It illustrates the feasibility, availability, credibility and practicability of computational logistics preliminarily.},

  abstract={Given the pervasive reliance on technology in modern society, teaching Computational Thinking (CT) abilities is becoming increasingly relevant. These abilities, such as modeling and coding, have become crucial for a larger audience of students, not only those who wish to become software engineers or computer scientists. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, provide powerful assistance to complete computational tasks, by simplifying code generation and debugging, and potentially enhancing interactive learning. However, it is not clear if these advances make CT tasks more accessible and inclusive for all students, or if they further contribute to a digital skills divide, favoring the top students. To address this gap, we have created and evaluated a novel learning scenario for transversal CT skills that leveraged LLMs as assistants. We conducted an exploratory field study during the spring semester of 2022, to assess the effectiveness and user experience of LLM-augmented learning. Our results indicate that the usage of ChatGPT as a learning assistant improves learning outcomes. Furthermore, contrary to our predictions, the usage of ChatGPT by students does not depend on prior CT capabilities and as such does not seem to exacerbate prior inequalities.},

  abstract={The broad-scale emergence of AI in industry calls forth basic questions in terms of the knowledge bases and approaches relevant for its design. Engineering design has been mainly developed for electromechanical artifacts. In practice, this has meant that the scientific knowledge required for creating technical artifacts such as engines, cars, ships, cranes, telephones, radios, TVs, and simple data processing units has been natural science. However, one cannot find intelligent processes by means of physics and chemistry. Natural scientific phenomena follow their deterministic laws, but intelligence is based on selection and decision processes. The conceptual landscape of natural science is optimized for different kinds of phenomena than intelligent information processing. Consequently, the basic research under technology design should be rethought in light of the emergence of AI. To grasp intelligent information processing, we need concepts and approaches suited for the task. To create intelligent technologies on this basis, we need concepts and approaches that afford the operationalization of such information in artificial systems. We suggest that psychology of thinking and cognitive modeling provide a logical basis for future AI design.},

The tool follows the Internet of Things approach and consists of two prominent components: 1) SucreCore and 2) SucreCode. SucreCore incorporates an advanced microcontroller packaged in a more compact design and enables wireless connectivity. SucreCode, the block-based visual programming tool, supports two different sets of blocks depending on the education grade, and facilitates wireless communication with SucreCore. At the educational level, Sucre4Stem fosters new group dynamics and encourages students to experiment real-world projects by promoting the “programming to learn” approach to concepts from other disciplines as opposed to the strategy widely applied in schools of “learning to program” in isolation.},

  abstract={The concept of systems thinking (and its embodiment in systems approach and systems science) dates from the historical origins of engineering, policy, and philosophy. However, unlike mathematics, physics, biology, and other fields with similar histories, systems thinking lacks a common language that facilitates transparent communication across domains. Examples from the authors' research and from literature show that research in and the practice of systems thinking would benefit from a common language and foundation of systems thinking. We present for discussion the results of our metathinking approach to a standard lexicon of systems thinking, i.e., the Dimensions of Systems Thinking. We also introduce key concepts including the observer effect of systems thinking, the difference between the scope of the analysis and the boundaries of the system, and the distinction between the metrics and indices of performance of a system. The way forward will be to discuss and debate the elements of the language of systems thinking, to establish criteria for evaluating the quality of systems thinking, and to test this methodology on case studies.},

  abstract={Security for every organization in the digital space is of primary focus and to better highlight and define the strategies to keep the systems safe and secure is of prime importance. While unauthorized access and unethical actions by intruders remain a cause of concern, ensuring the right measures through proper Threat Modelling techniques is necessary to create a barrier against them. The intention of getting access to a system or website or server can be born out of multiple threat groups and can be classified into common security threats. This paper looks at a persona-based approach to identify user groups that can be a threat to a system and how we can use the concepts of Design Thinking to model the system and protect it from possible security breaches. Considering the agile methodologies of software development, the paper talks about focusing on a perspective that discusses a design methodology by keeping the individuals and interactions for working models at the top of threat modelling measures.},

  abstract={In the realm of computational physics education, enhancing student engagement remains a pivotal challenge. This research delved into the potential of Project-Based Learning (PBL), with a particular emphasis on the VBA Physics Simulation, to invigorate students’ learning engagement. By surveying undergraduate students’ perceptions in computational physics course, we observed a predominant positive response towards the PBL model. The findings underscore that students not only appreciate the structured learning experience PBL offers but also value the guidance from lecturers in this approach. Through the lens of PBL, students reported a marked improvement in various skills, including the 4C skills (Critical thinking, Communication, Collaboration, Creativity), problem-solving, and higher-order thinking skills. This study advocates for the broader integration of PBL in computational physics course, especially using tools like VBA Physics Simulation, as a means to deepen understanding and amplify student engagement. We also recommend future quantitative research to further solidify these findings.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) is a thought process designed to help students better solve complex problems using mental tools such as decomposition, abstraction, heuristics, data collection, algorithms, modeling, and communication (Wing, 2006). This study is part of a larger National Science Foundation funded STEM+C (computing) study that integrates CT in informal STEM learning. The informal STEM+CT curriculum resulted from the large study was guided by project-based learning (PBL) to help 4th to 6th grade students practice CT in the context of problem solving. Twenty-four teachers have worked with small groups of students in an afterschool community center program over an 8-weeks period. The larger STEM+C study also encouraged teachers in adapting the informal STEM+CT curriculum in their own classrooms, which eight of the 24 teachers have done so. This study investigates the participating teacher's perspective on implementing CT into elementary classrooms after they had facilitated the STEM+CT curriculum in community centers' after-school programs via interviewing 12 of the 24 teachers. The current study focuses on the challenges and issues regarding implementing CT in elementary classrooms. The results show that teachers collectively place the lack of time and the lack of professional development as the major obstacles in integrating CT into elementary classrooms.},

  abstract={Currently, there is a daily evolution of the world and our current digital society faces challenges for changing the environment. Currently, learning environments are undergoing an evolution due the increasing development of mobile technologies. Designing and implementing Smart Learning Environments (SLEs) has emerged to enhance the learning process and the creation of content. In this paper, we are interested on SLE. Our objective is to propose a new pedagogical approach to provide adaptive and personalized open learning based on Computational Thinking (CT). This contribution describes the main theoretical relationships between SLE, Open Learner Model, Open Education Resource, Open Practice and Open Pedagogy when developing SLE to promote the learning process. New pedagogical approaches, based on openness, need to be implemented. The goal is to orchestrate between different features of SLE in order to propose a Smart Open Learning Environment (SOLE). We focus in particular on the pedagogical scenario that will be deployed in a Smart Open Learning Environment (SOLE). The proposed scenario is promoted by Smart Open Pedagogy to enhance CT. We aim to deliver open assessment adapted to specific learner context profile, progress and CT’s Level in the learning.},

  abstract={In order to expand opportunities to learn computer science (CS), there is a growing push for inclusion of CS concepts and practices, such as computational thinking (CT), in required subjects like science. Integrated, transdisciplinary (CS/CT+X) approaches have shown promise for broadening access to CS and CT learning opportunities, addressing potential self-selection bias associated with elective CS coursework and afterschool programs, and promoting a more expansive and authentic contextualization of CS work. Emerging research also points to pedagogical strategies that can transcend simply broadening access, by also working to confront barriers to equitable and inclusive engagement in CS. Yet, approaches to integration vary widely, and there is little consensus on whether and how different models for CS and CT integration contribute to desired outcomes. There has also been little theory development that can ground systematic examination of the affordances and tradeoffs of different models. Toward that end, we propose a typology through which to examine CT integration in science (CT +S). The purpose of delineating a typology of CT+S integration is to encourage instantiation, implementation, and inspection of different models for integration, and to promote shared understanding among learning designers, researchers, and practitioners working at the intersection of CT and science. For each model in the typology, we characterize how CT+S integration is accomplished, the ways in which CT learning supports science learning, and the affordances and tensions for equity and inclusion that may arise upon implementation in science classrooms.},

  abstract={Recent years have seen a high volume of computational thinking (CT) review studies. However, there have been no existing studies that map these reviews with the goal of achieving comprehensive understanding of the field of CT. This paper utilizes Tikva & Tambouris’ (2021) K-12 CT research domain conceptual model as the basis for identifying and defining CT reviews, then maps the identified 38 CT reviews onto the identified domains. We pinpoint eight potential future review topics, including "communities" of tools, "modeling simulations," "problem-solving" and "scaffolding" of learning strategies, "demographic attributes" of factors, "practices" and "perspectives" of the knowledge-based areas, and the "teacher training" of capacity building. We also examine the topical keywords of the reviews and identify that the scope of the term "unplugged" is vaguely defined among the existing research, suggesting a need to refine the definition of this frequently discussed topic so as to be able to more effectively conduct supplementary reviews. Our results help to better understand the CT review field and formulate future directions.},

These shortages in case-based reasoning (CBR) and genetic algorithms (GA) were analyzed by the model. It was proved that the fundamental reason of these shortages is that they only can simulate a single process in the model of creative thinking. Then a simulation algorithm of directed similarity association is brought forward so as to realize the computation of similarity degree of product demand between components, and simulate the whole model of creative thinking by combining CBR and GA. A corresponding product design system was put forward, and then an experiment was conducted, and the results show that the combined intelligent algorithm has good performance in search.},

  abstract={At present, innovation courses for college students play a vital role in universities. It has also become an important teaching platform for cultivating superior talents. How to improve the level of innovative thinking of college students into high-quality national strategic talents has become a research topic of great concern. However, many university teachers still follow traditional instructional design. It is impossible to implement a customized approach to education. Responding to the deficiencies in the instructional design of innovative training for university students, the support vector machine and K-means clustering algorithms are combined to create a revolutionary network instructional system, which is then used in an undergraduate course. A virtual reality classroom, real-time chat features, and an evaluation system are just a few of the elements that make up this system. It makes it possible to personalize learning, share open data, have real-time debates, and participate in a variety of virtual learning activities. Through the use of conventional datasets, this integrated multi-algorithmic system’s dependability is illustrated. It can meet the diverse learning needs of college students and help solve the weaknesses of traditional instructional design. Since 2022, four evaluation techniques have been used to confirm the efficacy of this teaching strategy: student recognition analysis, final test passing rate, competition winning percentage, and classroom activity level assessment. The results support the following: Compared with the traditional teaching design, the novel network instructional system is more conducive to helping college students cultivate learning interests and enhance their innovative thinking level. The adoption and dissemination of this strategy will undoubtedly advance educational research and improve college students’ capacity for creative thought, fostering the development of top-notch creative talent and advancing sustainable societal development.},

  abstract={Today's digital society has turned the development of students' computational thinking capabilities into a critical factor for their future success. As higher education institutions, we need to take responsibility for this development in every degree course we offer, and provide students with the kind of subjects and activities that best contribute to this aim. In this paper, we study the impact of following an introductory programming course on the development of the computational thinking capabilities of university students. In order to achieve this aim, a concurrent cohort observational study was carried out in which we measured both the subjective and objective computational thinking capabilities of 104 participants (50 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Psychology at the Catholic University of Murcia (UCAM), and 54 first year students enrolled on a Bachelor's degree course in Health Information Systems at the University of Alicante (UA)). The statistical procedures applied to test our hypotheses were a two-way mixed ANOVA, a paired-sample T-test and an independent-sample T-test. The data shows that the group at UA had an initial higher subjective perception of their computational capabilities than the group at UCAM. This perception was supported by their objective scores, which were also significantly higher. However, the subjective assessment of computational capability of the UA group diminished after exposure to the programming course, contrasting with the fact that their objective computational capabilities improved significantly. In the UCAM group, both subjective and objective capabilities remained constant over time. Based on these results, we can conclude that computational thinking capabilities are not developed naturally, but need to be trained. Providing such training to all our students, and not only to those enrolled on undergraduate degrees in engineering, is of paramount importance to allow them to face the challenges of their future professions. This paper empirically demonstrates the extent to which exposing subjects to a programming course may contribute to this aim.},

  abstract={Sorting is an algorithmic concept that is covered in every fundamental computer science and engineering course and included in most if not all programming competitions. It is an everyday task, self-taught and done naturally even by a small child. In spite of its ingenuousness, mastering sorting algorithms turns out to be not so simple for many first-time programmers. This happens because how humans perform sorting is far from being straightforwardly aligned with machine instructions. We have developed an unplugged game-based learning activity that aims not only to tackle this difficult dilemma but also to promote computational thinking practice. Our game robustly challenges audiences to complete a fun sorting task algorithmically and the building blocks of the exercise are methodologically grounded in the four cornerstones of computational thinking. Participants are gently guided through solving a problem by decomposing it, recognizing patterns, applying abstraction, writing step-by-step instructions, and finally arriving at a programmable solution. Our design is largely flexible. The game can be played in small groups or larger ones. It uses only common, readily accessible materials, and is easily adaptable to different levels of audiences, from the interested general public to secondary school students and teachers, to non-computer science undergraduates and those majoring in engineering or information technology related subjects. We have implemented this activity in our classrooms and conducted several workshops. Responses were markedly positive. Engaged from the beginning to the end, participants enjoyed the activity, having fun sorting. Appreciated the ideas, audiences were captivated by many surprising challenges. Most notably, they were able to comprehend the concepts of sorting algorithms and the computational steps behind them, and gain a better understanding of computational thinking.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is a fundamental analytical ability to solve problems, design systems, and understand human behavior based on the fundamental concepts of computer science. The concept of computational thinking is almost needed on every profession in the computerization of society. Teaching computational thinking to cultivate problem solving ability by computer is a challenge of computer science education, especially for the K-12 level. Although studies introduce computational concepts by programming design, computational thinking and computer science are not computer programming. The study uses social simulation content (i.e. NetLogo, which uses muti-agent technology) to scaffold learning computational thinking concepts, such as simple genetic algorithm, parallel computing, artificial neural net, or deadlock (such as dining philosophers). To stimulate learning transfer onto computational thinking, NetLogo models library will be used to motivate reflection and meta-cognition development. Preliminary experimental results came from both questionnaires and artifacts. In the future, Gero's (1990) function-behaviour-structure (FBS) ontology will be used for the qualitative analysis to explain the outcomes of learning transfer.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) is a set of thinking processes used by computer scientists to formulate problems and describe solutions. In recent years, CT has been largely explored by the Computing Education community. Due to its potential to contribute to problem solving and analytical thinking, CT could also be a relevant subject in K-12 education. For such, there is a need to qualify educators in CT. In this paper, we describe our experience in a large-scale course on Computational Thinking for pre-service teachers. Our goal is to qualify pre-service teachers in CT, both in the comprehension of its definition and how it can be incorporated in classroom. Our experience indicates that the participants had a positive awareness of CT concepts, as well as an adequate understanding of the pedagogical approaches to teach the subject. They also developed positive attitudes towards the field of Computer Science.},

  abstract={Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. This course will look at the synergies that are required across the stack from new devices to new computational models for designing future computing systems. This course will enable attendees to understand the inter-twined nature of design optimization that requires one to interact with experts in different domains. The students will be exposed to simulation tools and modelling techniques to help explore new circuits and architectures. As physical dimensional scaling alone has ceased to be the key factor driving the industry, many innovations have occurred in designing new types of logic switches including changes to their structure (such as three-dimensional FinFETs), their underlying physics (use of tunneling for steep-switching devices), the material systems (integration of ferro-electrics in gate stack for Negative Capacitance FETs). The first part of the lecture will introduce these devices, simulation models and accompanying circuit innovations. There has been a world of revolution in the memory devices with the emergence of many nonvolatile memory technologies and their tight integration in cross-point architectures. These memory systems have enabled new styles of computing systems such as the non-volatile processor for internet of thing systems and neuromorphic computing systems for cognitive computing. The lectures will focus on the synergistic coordination in advances in devices to system design. Neuromorphic systems also leverage new advances in technology such as cross-point memory arrays to integrate computing and store. Another emerging novel computational model is based on the principle “let physics do the computation”. This technique focuses on using the intrinsic operation mechanism of devices (such as nanoscale electronic coupled oscillators) to do the computation, instead of building complex circuits with standard transistors to carry out the same function. The primary objective is to train the next generation researchers and practitioners that can understand the synergy across the stack from devices to applications. This will prepare the next generation workforce for the beyond Moore era using post-CMOS devices and new computational paradigms beyond Von-Neumann computing models. This course will introduce the following topics: [1] Emerging logic and memory devices: What value do they add for circuit designers/architects? [2] Circuit/Architecture design using Emerging Logic and Memory devices [3] Neuromorphic and Brain-Inspired Computing using emerging devices [4] Computing Using Coupled Dynamical Systems.},

  abstract={Although Computer Science has grown to become one of the most highly demanded professional careers, every year, only a small percentage of students choose a degree directly related to Computer Science. Perhaps the problem lies in the lack of information that society has about Computer Science itself, and particularly about the work computer scientists do. No one doubts the role of Mathematics or Languages as core subjects in every primary and secondary education syllabus; however, Computer Science plays a negligible role in most current syllabuses. Only in a few countries have governments paid special attention to content related to Computer Science and to learning to analyze and solve problems the way computer scientists do (Computational Thinking). In this article, we present Piens@ Computacion@ULLmente, a project that provides a methodology to promote Computer Science through Computational Thinking activities among primary and secondary education students. The results obtained from an exhaustive statistical analysis of the data we collected demonstrate that the perception of Computer Science that pre-university students have can be improved through specific training. Moreover, we can also confirm that the performance of pre-university students involving Computational Thinking skills is independent of gender, particularly at the primary education level.},

This examination reveals the current situation and possible problems in the practice of cultivating computational thinking and provide some useful references. Continuous comparison are used to code and analyze the interview data. The article founds that the instructional procedure of cultivating computational thinking in programming education generally involves five major stages: knowledge review, new knowledge exploration, problem analysis, programming on computer, and the stage of reflection. Instructional strategies accordingly include: mind map-supported, unplugged programming, flow chart use, pair programming, log reflection, and more. Finally, the paper concludes with the problems that appeared in teaching, especially in the stage of new knowledge exploration, unplugged programming and pair-programming.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) is considered as the skill of 21st century. The fundamental CT concepts include abstraction, algorithm design, decomposition, pattern recognition, and data representation or generalization. CT assessment is required to improve the understanding of the cognitive abilities and to relate them in related areas, such as introductory programming in computer science. Assessing computational thinking skills however is a challenging issue since it measures latent variables that cannot be directly observed. In addition, according to psychometrics, appropriate test requires a validation process before it can be effectively used as a measuring instrument. Thus, high quality tools for measuring student learning in Introductory Programming have been under-developed and under-researched. The objective of this work is to determine the psychometric properties (item validity, reliability, discrimination, difficulty, and distractors) of the developed multiple-choice questions of computational thinking in introductory programming by exploring classical test theory and item response theory which has not been deeply investigated by previous studies. The analysis results reveal that most of items are valid and the items are generally adequate reliable. In spite of the fact that some items are suggested to be revised since the item discrimination values, the distribution of difficulties, and distractor points are less than the expected threshold.},

However, differing from other computing forms of field problem described by partial differential equations, the computation of electromagnetic field did not really use series of the general, abstract and formalized methods. And people have to construct forms of different models to make computation. Such a method of computation can also arrange forms particular propositions suitably. But, it cannot be regarded as a universal method and it is usually implicates some logic mistakes and physical distortion. The reason would be: time-dependent electromagnetic field lacks of a united mathematical physical model that can guarantee both the partial differential equations and boundary conditions consistent in logic. In reverse, if a general mathematical model is perfect in logic, it can not only allow us to effectively use the computation methods supplied by computational mathematics but also provide more full and more exact information about electromagnetic field.},

  abstract={Central to the theory of learning are inquiry-based approaches to education. Whereas there is a plethora of research on inquiry learning in the domain of science [19], [20], few studies have analyzed how inquiry-based learning can be applied to computer science education, and how different approaches to inquiry may benefit diverse learners. This is one of the first studies to analyze teacher enactment of inquiry-based learning during the implementation of an upper elementary, computational thinking curriculum, and to explore how teacher approaches to inquiry appear to support or constrain multilingual students' development of computational thinking and computer science identities. Design-based research was used to iteratively develop, test, and refine the inquiry-based curriculum, which aligns with computer science and literacy standards, provides linguistic scaffolding, and integrates culturally responsive materials. We adopt a cross-case mixed-methods design to collect data from five teachers and 149 students including detailed field notes, teacher interviews, student computational artifacts, and student identity surveys. Through analyses of teacher moves, we find that teachers adopt different approaches to inquiry that can be indexed along a continuum ranging from open to closed. Patterns in student data revealed that those who received more structured inquiry lessons developed more sophisticated computational artifacts and showed greater identification with the field of computer science. Findings from this study are being used to add more structured inquiry approaches to the next iteration of our curriculum, including integrating USE/MODIFY/CREATE models into lessons and applying metacognitive strategies from reading research to students' programming activities.},

  abstract={In the rapidly evolving landscape of education, the cultivation of computational skills and the enhancement of students' intellectual abilities remain of paramount importance. This research paper delves into the innovative approach of leveraging Multiple Intelligence (MI) theory to foster computational skills among high school students. The study specifically focuses on a group of 26 computer science high school students at N azarbayev Intellectual School in Shymkent, Kazakhstan. The research employs a comprehensive and structured methodology that integrates MI principles into the classroom environment. Over a designated timeframe, students participate in a variety of activities designed to engage and stimulate each of their unique intelligences. Language, mathematics, spatial perception, motor skills, music, personal, and intrapersonal communication intelligences are all encompassed in these pursuits., creating a holistic learning experience. Data collection encompasses a multitude of measures, including pre- and post-assessments, observations, and student feedback, to gauge demonstrate the significant improvement in students' computational abilities following the MI-enhanced curriculum. In particular, students displayed increased problem-solving skills, critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability when confronted with computational challenges. The conclusion of this study contribute significant analysis into the potential of MI theory to transform traditional computer science education. By providing a dynamic and inclusive learning environment that nurtures students' diverse intellectual strengths, educators can empower learners to excel in computational disciplines. This research paper encourages further exploration of MI- based strategies to enhance computational abilities and inspires a shift towards more personalized and inspires a shift towards more personalized and effective teaching methodologies.},

  abstract={This paper describes a learning activity on computational thinking in ethics classroom with compulsory secondary school students (14-16 years old). It is based on the assumption that computational thinking (or better “logical thinking”) is applicable not only to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics subjects but to any other field in education, and it is particularly suited for decision making in moral dilemmas. This will be carried out through the study of so called “moral machines," using a game-based learning approach on self-driving vehicles and the need to program such cars to perform certain behavior's under extreme situations. Students will be asked to logically base their reasoning on different ethical approaches and try to develop a schema of decision making that could serve to program a machine to respond to those situations. Students will also have to deal with the uncertainty of reaching solutions that will be debatable and not universally accepted as a part of the difficulty, more ethical than technical, to provide machines with the ability to take decisions where there is no such thing as a “right” versus “wrong” answer, and potentially both (or more) of the possible actions will bring unwanted consequences.},

The results found that the level of computational thinking in the experimental class was also significantly different from the pretest, and the students in the experimental class rated each item of the course above 7 points. This indicates that this course has a significant effect on cultivating students' computational thinking, and the learners had a good learning experience and made gains from this course.},

  abstract={This paper focuses on game development using Mixed Reality technology, the Magic Leap One device, by exploring with The Lab and Unreal Engine program that are developed in game interpolating Computational Thinking (CT). The research device focuses on integrating thinking skills into 3D games with real-time user interaction. From mixed reality (MR) the application of technology is evaluated in its use for learning effectiveness. The game aims to promote a computational thinking process based on the terms and conditions within 5 levels as well as the complexity of the game with more obstacles in each level as the character travels from beginning to destination. Commands provide for different contexts. Major goal is using mixed reality technology to advance convergence in computing education and training in computational thinking (CT) to help players strengthen their thinking process and CT through the game. This game can be an alternative learning medium for the educator in primary school (Grade 4–6). The assessment of target users 10–15 persons before and after the game tests have 3 aspects in technology, CT, and usability of game performance. An expert evaluation was conducted after the test. Assessment of the overall game focuses on building of CT skill within the game relative to project objectives. Evaluation results were 77.8% by users and 88.6% by the expert. Furthermore, some useful suggestions from assessment suggest adding workshop guidelines for educators or trainers. Thus, this project contributes to the computing education community by using available cutting-edge technology as an optional teaching tool in CT that suits learners in education at the primary level and looks toward future development for higher education.},

  abstract={In the last years, many didactic activities have been proposed to develop Computational Thinking (CT) skills in children and adolescents. Among these activities, the digital game programming stands out as a promising alternative considering that it is related to a familiar and motivating context for students. These initiatives are not specifically aimed at individuals with special needs such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Children and adolescents with ASD usually have some limitations related to communication, cognitive flexibility, and interpersonal relationships. However, it seems natural that the skills potentially developed through game programming activities are especially beneficial for the public with ASD. In this paper, we describe the offering and evaluation of a Game Building Workshop adapted to adolescents with this condition. The guidelines used to define the workshop activities are described. An assessment based on the classroom observation and analysis of produced artifacts indicate that the participants acquired CT skills related to programming at a high level. In addition, the collaborative nature of the activities offered a stimulating and welcoming environment for individuals with ASD.},

  abstract={While specialized knowledge and skills are the hallmark of modern society, the size and complexity of contemporary problems often require cooperative effort to analyze and solve. Therefore, experiences with skills, methodologies, and tools for effective interdisciplinary collaboration and structured problem solving are vital for preparing students for future academic and professional success. Meanwhile, computational systems have permeated much of modern professional and personal life, making computational thinking an essential skill for members of modern society. However, formal training in these techniques is primarily limited to students within computer science, mathematics, management of information systems, and engineering. At Iowa State University, we have designed and offered an experimental course to develop undergraduate students' abilities for interdisciplinary teamwork and to disseminate computational thinking skills to a broader range of students. This novel course was jointly designed and instructed by faculty from the Computer Science Department, Gerontology Program, and Graphic Design Program to incorporate diverse faculty expertise and pedagogical approaches. Students were required to interview real users to identify real-life problems, gather requirements, and assess candidate solutions, which necessitated communication both within the group and with technologically-disinclined users. In-class presentations and wiki-based project websites provided regular practice at disseminating domain expertise to larger interdisciplinary audiences. Workshops, group-based mentoring, peer learning, and guided discovery allowed non-CS majors to learn much more about computer programs and tools, and grading criteria held students individually accountable within their disciplines but also emphasized group collaboration},

  abstract={Until now, significant R&D effort in the field of Computational Creativity, has been devoted towards understudying the elements of the creative process from idea conception to production, or towards designing machines which exhibit human level creativity without merely mimicking the human creative process. However, in the effort to determine if an artefact is creative by human standards, it is also important to examine the perception of creativity by humans and to which extend this perception can be formalized and applied on the evaluation of creative works. In this paper, we investigate how the human perception for creativity exhibited in text artefacts can be predicted using appropriate formulations of computational creativity metrics. To this end, we designed and executed a storytelling experiment assisted by the usage of computational tools. We subsequently exploited human-provided rankings of the stories in order to train a model for evaluating creativity as a combination of various characteristics of the produced stories.},

  abstract={The systematic solutions to planning and scheduling for container terminal logistics systems (CTLS) have been scarce owing to their high complexity and strong randomness. This paper extended the past research on modeling CTLS with computer composition principles and architecture. The comparability and the further mapping relationships between CTLS and multi-processor system-on-chip (MPSoC) were discussed at great length within the theoretical viewpoints of computational thinking. Whereafter a container terminal logistics computational architecture was put forward for scheduling and execution using the perspective of MPSoC, which was established on the conceptual framework and fundamental principles of distributed, parallel, and cooperative computing in essence. Finally, the approach was demonstrated by investigating the stress testing, load balancing and process behavior of a typical container terminal logistics service case in contrast with the previous work based on the comprehensive computational experiments.},

  abstract={Any cognizable thing (object, or idea) can be recognized as a concept, and they are usually described by modality-specific, experience-dependent, or localist-distributed representations. There has been a significant effort in studying concrete concepts, along with their underlying cognitive and psychological processes through conceptual representations produced by computational approaches (like Artificial Neural Networks). However, the notion of abstract concepts, though debated, is seldom explored. In this article, we propose an approach to learn abstract representation of concepts with Regulated Activation Networks (RANs) evolving computational modeling. RANs methodology is illustrated using a toydata problem, and evaluated for metrics Precision, Recall, Fl-score, and Accuracy, along with ROC curve analysis. RANs comparison is presented using a benchmark data from human activity recognition domain, yielding Precision= 98.20% (ca.), Recall= 97.62% (ca.), Fl-score= 97.8 (ca.), and Accuracy= 97.62% (ca.). Sleep Detection data from SOCIALITE project is used to model active and inactive students, showing a convincing performance. Further, the model is used in studying 3 students in order to deduce biomarkers for understanding their psychological conditions.},

A single assessment was issued at the beginning and end of each semester in order to track metrics about fellow-teacher pairings, student understanding of CT concepts, and student interest in STEM+C areas. Using statistical analysis software to evaluate the data, we were able to determine the efficacy of the DISSECT program. In particular, we use descriptive statistics to evaluate the trends in CT vocabulary recognition and overall interest in computing, and we compare trends across courses and grade levels.},

  abstract={Computational Thinking (CT) introduces computing concepts and demonstrates their usefulness in many other disciplines. CT principles such as algorithmic problem solving, abstraction, modeling and simulation, are integrated into existing STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) curricula by DISSECT (DIScover SciEnce through Computational Thinking). By pairing a local K-12 teacher with a graduate fellow, DISSECT provides instruction and resources as instruments that are pertinent to each specific discipline. These skills in problem-solving and abstract reasoning are necessary for students to be able to compete in the modern and future job markets. DISSECT works to provide these skill-sets to students and classrooms that lack access to computers. The K-12 teachers and graduate fellows work together to develop modules that are capable of teaching CT concepts that are directly tied to their current curriculum while removing the need for access to computer systems. This paper will focus on the modules developed and executed in middle and high school classrooms, emphasizing the creative ways explored to operate in a computer-free environment discussing the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches, while qualitatively assessing student engagement, learning, and interaction which is gathered through teacher interviews, observations and informal talks with students.},

  abstract={Digital games are becoming more and more a part of our daily lives. After realizing this, several educators have been motivated to use games as teaching and learning tools. In this sense, it is possible to involve teachers and students in the production of their own games, thus contributing both to the development of computational thinking and to acquiring knowledge related to the different disciplines involved in this process. Despite the benefits, the production of games is a complex task that requires knowledge of a specific domain and presents a significant learning curve for students and teachers. The choice of using effective strategies such as Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) practices supported by a Controlled Natural Language (CNL) to promote the production of games in the educational context is decisive and can favor the adoption of game-based learning. This work proposes a strategy for the specification of game design for digital games by students and teachers in the classroom, that can promote the development of computational thinking, as well as reading and writing skills.},

  abstract={The manual assessment of creativity by human raters is coupled with unavoidable subjectivity and often costs much time and human resources. To address these issues, this paper explores how to apply natural language processing (NLP) methods to the assessment of creativity. Using the Alternative Use Task (AUT), participants were encouraged to generate ideas as fast as possible for a fixed time. It was hypothesized that the similarity of ideas would decrease over time in the AUT, considering the design fixation and the limitation of working memory. In the first study, 12 university students completed the AUT in paper-pencil form and generated a total of 376 responses. We applied two NLP models, namely BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) and USE (Universal Sentence Encoder), to assess the similarity of responses between individuals. The results did not confirm our hypothesis. One prominent reason might be that the applied models represent millions of sentence structures that are over-ecological and too dissimilar to the sentence structures participants had used while finishing the AUT. Nevertheless, the results did show that BERT and USE could more accurately express the semantic information of responses pace with the Latent Semantic Analysis, a popular computer-aided model for AUT response assessment. In study 2, we proposed an algorithm to reanalyze the 376 responses in study 1 based on word embedding with crowdsourced responses. There were 1690 crowdsourced responses collected from 550 participants who completed an online version of the AUT. The results supported our hypothesis and showed that the similarity of responses increases as time passes. This indicates the proposed algorithm would alleviate the influence of sentence structure in AUT tasks. The differences between BERT, USE, and proposed algorithms are discussed in relation to the assessment of creativity, and the implications for future work are explored in-depth.},

  abstract={Block-based programming languages reduce the need to learn low-level programming syntax while enabling novice learners to focus on computational thinking skills. Game-based learning environments have been shown to create effective and engaging learning experiences for students in a broad range of educational domains. The fusion of block-based programming with game-based learning offers significant potential to motivate learners to develop computational thinking skills. A key challenge educational game developers face in creating rich, interactive learning experiences that integrate computational thinking activities is the lack of an embeddable block-based programming toolkit. Current block-based programming languages, such as Blockly and Scratch, cannot be easily embedded into industry-standard 3D game engines. This paper presents IntelliBlox, a Blockly-inspired toolkit for the Unity cross-platform game engine that enables learners to create block-based programs within immersive game-based learning environments. Our experience using IntelliBlox suggests that it is an effective toolkit for integrating block-based programming challenges into game-based learning environments.},

  abstract={This research-track work-in-progress paper contributes to engineering education by documenting progress in developing a new standard Engineering Computational Thinking Diagnostic to measure engineering student success in five factors of computational thinking. Over the past year, results from an initial validation attempt were used to refine diagnostic questions. A second statistical validation attempt was then completed in Spring 2021 with 191 student participants at three universities. Statistics show that all diagnostic questions had statistically significant factor loadings onto one general computational thinking factor that incorporates the five original factors of (a) Abstraction, (b) Algorithmic Thinking, (c) Decomposition, (d) Data Representation and Organization, and (e) Impact of Computing. This result was unexpected as our goal was a diagnostic that could discriminate among the five factors. A small population size caused by the virtual delivery of courses during the COVID-19 pandemic may be the explanation and a third round of validation in Fall 2021 is expected to result in a larger population given the return to face-to-face instruction. When statistical validation is completed, the diagnostic will help institutions identify students with strong entry level skills in computational thinking as well as students that require academic support. The diagnostic will inform curriculum design by demonstrating which factors are more accessible to engineering students and which factors need more time and focus in the classroom. The long-term impact of a successfully validated computational thinking diagnostic will be introductory engineering courses that better serve engineering students coming from many backgrounds. This can increase student self-efficacy, improve student retention, and improve student enculturation into the engineering profession. Currently, the diagnostic identifies general computational thinking skill},

  abstract={Emotions are essential drivers of the learning process, influencing motivation, performance, and problem-solving abilities. In the field of Computer Science, students often struggle with negative emotions during programming activities, impacting their performance and project quality. To address this challenge, there is a growing need to introduce Computational Thinking skills at the pre-university level. This study focuses on understanding the emotions experienced by primary and secondary school students during Computational Thinking activities, involving both plugged and unplugged tools. A significant performance difference was observed between primary and secondary education levels, with the latter outperforming the former. The research identifies specific associations between concepts and emotions, highlighting age-related differences with younger students exhibiting more positive emotions. While gender-based disparities in Computer Science perception exist in secondary education, there are no corresponding distinctions in emotional responses. The study reveals a gender-based effect, with girls showing reduced emotional responses and lower Computational Thinking performance than boys. In summary, this research underscores the profound role of emotions in learning, providing essential insights for tailoring educational strategies considering gender-specific and programming concept-related factors. It also connects lower emotional reactions to inferior results, emphasizing the importance of heightened emotional engagement.},

  abstract={The recent urgency for counterterrorism and the fight to protect ones' homeland are of grave concern to nations throughout the world. Finding an efficient process that could have screened passengers prior to boarding a flight or even a train may have derailed many devastating events. Scientific research has continuously proved that there is an explicit marker of neuronal activity that correlates with awareness, past experience, and short-term interactions from the well-known P300 peak of an evoked potential. This study examines the effects of memory recognition to certain key stimuli mixed with irrelevant variables in an effort to identify if a trained terrorist, per se, could not only be identified from a group of subjects, but also validate that the willingness to withhold information is out of the control of the individual; it's simple, one has no control in concealing their brain's activity.},

  abstract={In recent years, educational research has emphasized the significance of computational thinking (CT) and mathematics knowledge acquisition for students' learning in engineering subjects. Pre-college education plays a crucial role in preparing students for future engineering learning. While the relationship between CT and mathematics has been extensively studied at the K-12 level, limited attention has been given to early childhood education (ECE) contexts. Our research aims to investigate the potential development of early CT through mathematics learning in a potentially reciprocal manner using developmentally appropriate educational tools and instructional approaches. To commence this exploration, our primary focus is to conduct a systematic review of existing empirical studies, synthesizing evidence to illuminate the interaction between CT and mathematics during early childhood. Using the seven powerful ideas from early CT proposed by Bers as the theoretical framework, our initial findings indicate that algorithms, hardware/software, and representation are the most studied CT competencies intersecting with early mathematics skills, including numerical and spatial knowledge, measurements, basic algebraical thinking, and data processing. The complex relationship between early CT and mathematics, in general, is also discussed. Overall, the findings of this study suggest that existing mathematics education in early childhood may foster the development of CT in young children. Although this study is preliminary, it serves as a valuable foundation for future research endeavors in uncovering the interdisciplinary nature of early CT within mathematics-integrated learning contexts, thus contributing to the advancement of this field.},

  abstract={Robot-mediated learning activities are often designed as collaborative exercises where children work together to achieve the activity objectives. Although miscommunications and misunderstandings occur frequently, humans, unlike robots, are very good at overcoming them and converging to a shared solution. With the aim of equipping a robot with these abilities and exploring its effects, in this article we investigate how a humanoid robot can collaborate with a human learner to construct a shared solution to a problem via suggesting actions and (dis)agreeing with each other. Concretely, we designed a learning activity aiming to improve the computational thinking skills of children, in which the robot makes suggestions on what to do, that may be in line with what the human thinks or not. Furthermore, the robot may suggest wrong actions that could essentially prevent them from finding a correct solution. Via a pilot study conducted remotely with 9 school children, we investigate whether the interaction results in positive learning outcomes, how the collaboration evolves, and how these relate to each other. The results show positive learning outcomes for the participants in terms of finding better solutions, suggesting that the collaboration with the robot might have helped trigger the learning mechanisms.},

  abstract={Programming has become a crucial skill in today’s world. Technology and computers are basically part of anything now. President Obama once referred to the importance of children learning programming: “I do not want our young people to just be consumers, I want them to be producers of this technology and to understand it, to feel like they are controlling it, as opposed to it controlling them.” It is thus an increasing need for an individual to know how to write their own programs. With the increasing dependency on computation, one can anticipate such skills being a requirement for most jobs in the coming years. There is a lot of effort done in this area, however most of them focused on either software or hardware track. The aim of this work is to test if using a hybrid approach for teaching K-12 students programming by combining both software and hardware techniques is more effective than using a singleton approach.},

  abstract={This Research Full Paper introduces a model for structuring playful, challenge-based learning activities drawing on a process of decontextualisation of a challenge to access its Computational Thinking intellectual and conceptual components and subsequent computationalisation of these components into computational artifacts that are recontextualised to render them attractive and accessible to school pupils. The case study follows a thick description approach to evaluating the engagement potential of the instructional design, as well as the didactic choices made during implementation. We conclude that Bebras cards and Dash robots provide considerable support for a playful engagement with computational concepts and engaging children with different scientific backgrounds in Computational Thinking. In particular, flexibility in how they are used and easy adaptation of challenge level make them useful in contexts with broad participation. Additionally we find that using robots to provide a link between the theoretical presentation of CT in the Bebras card and a physical representation and programming challenge is engaging and helps participants to focus on algorithmic concepts.},

  year={2017},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Computer programming is being introduced in schools worldwide as part of a movement that promotes Computational Thinking (CT) skills among young learners. In general, learners use visual, block-based programming languages to acquire these skills, with Scratch being one of the most popular ones. Similar to professional developers, learners also copy and paste their code, resulting in duplication. In this paper we present the findings of correlating the assessment of the CT skills of learners with the presence of software clones in over 230,000 projects obtained from the Scratch platform. Specifically, we investigate i) if software cloning is an extended practice in Scratch projects, ii) if the presence of code cloning is independent of the programming mastery of learners, iii) if code cloning can be found more frequently in Scratch projects that require specific skills (as parallelism or logical thinking), and iv) if learners who have the skills to avoid software cloning really do so. The results show that i) software cloning can be commonly found in Scratch projects, that ii) it becomes more frequent as learners work on projects that require advanced skills, that iii) no CT dimension is to be found more related to the absence of software clones than others, and iv) that learners -even if they potentially know how to avoid cloning- still copy and paste frequently. The insights from this paper could be used by educators and learners to determine when it is pedagogically more effective to address software cloning, by educational programming platform developers to adapt their systems, and by learning assessment tools to provide better evaluations.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},

  pages={148-153},
  abstract={The primary issue of garbage is its direct impact on the environment and quality of life. Several types of trash have piled up in Thailand. Many individuals don’t use the correct way of waste management because they have lacked knowledge and understanding of how to sort rubbish since childhood. To increase the possibility to fully utilize the knowledge of waste separation correctly, the researcher aims to promote computational thinking through the learning of a game called “Trashman”. This game simulates various objects for situations of sorting garbage into the appropriate sorting bin. Trashman has 3 levels in the game. Each level increases the number of bins and the amount of garbage, starting from level 1-3 which refers to easy, moderate, and difficult levels, respectively. The level indicates the error of separating the waste if putting it into a wrong bin type. The educating about different types of waste separation through the game utilizes Mixed Reality (MR) technology of the Magic Leap One device. The developer’s expectation for an alternative learning medium in the form of a game is to allow players to apply their knowledge by practicing computational skills by sorting garbage correctly. The game evaluates and summarizes scores of each level at the game’s end. This will evaluate player’s performance of CT through their ability separating trash. Moreover, the Sustainable Development Goals can be applied for lifelong learning to follow-up and assessment in furtherance of correct trash sorting.},

  abstract={Research-based learning (RBL) familiarizes students with the academic research process at an early stage and at the same time offers them the opportunity to actively shape their own learning process. Working on their own research problems allows students to go through the entire research cycle, which promotes not only subject and methodological competencies but also the students' self-competencies. The handling of subject-specific and didactic challenges of this form of teaching-learning has been discussed many times in the past. New challenges for research-based learning now arise from the shift of teaching and learning to virtual space associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper focuses on the adaptation of a research-based teaching-learning format to the demands of e-learning in the course Interaction Science with Artificial Intelligence. We evaluated the adapted teaching-learning format with 18 students in a master's program in STEM. The students stated an increase in professional competence in the areas of programming, data preparation and data visualization. Our results suggest that peer group and direct interaction via synchronous communication channels are important structural frameworks for research-based learning in an online learning context. From our results, we can derive initial implications for online-based RBL in the field of computational education.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents the development of the algorithmic expressions for the assessment tools for assessing algorithmic thinking ability of elementary school children. In Japan, elementary school children will be required to learn computer programming as an interdisciplinary element appearing throughout the curriculum in 2020. The purpose of this programming education is to nurture Computational Thinking (CT) for elementary school children in Japan. However, almost no discussion has been conducted in Japan on how to measure the level of CT an elementary school child has acquired. Since the definition of CT is not very firm, it is not easy to measure the levels of CT. Therefore, several organizations have issued operational definitions of CT. Among the concepts of CT in those operational definitions, Algorithmic Thinking was chosen as a representative of CT, and the assessment tools for evaluating Algorithmic Thinking ability have been developed in this research. The assessment tool was conducted in the experimental Computer Science Unplugged classes and in the control classes in two elementary schools in Japan. There were in total 152 children in the classes, and all of them were 5th grade children. By answering the questions in the assessment tool, each child got a score between 0 and 15. The scores were statistically analyzed.},

  abstract={In this paper we describe our process for synthesizing frameworks for recognizing student talents in the areas of Computational Thinking (CT) and Engineering Design (ED) from prior research. Computer science education research has resulted in multiple, overlapping definitions of CT as an approach towards solving problems using methods and tools that are derived from computer science. Our development of operationalized definitions of CT talent for middle school educators is focused on uniting models for CT in a simplified structure. Our ED definition framework builds on multiple distinct models of the engineering design process along with concepts from systems engineering models and the design thinking process. We operationalize these frameworks to provide teachers with metrics and examples for recognizing and assessing the CT and ED skills of their students in non-technical classes. By training teachers to evaluate students' processes from the perspective of an engineer and computer scientist, teachers are more able to help their STEM-inclined students recognize the alignments between their own talents and possible careers. Through the analysis of teacher surveys and interviews from 19 classroom implementations, we evaluated the changes that the Arts & Bots program has had on teacher perceptions of student CT and ED skills and talents.},

  pages={360-364},
  abstract={In this paper, we describe on-going work on the ensemble of two models for computational creativity using commonsense knowledge. The GENCAD model of computational creativity proposes the use of an evolutionary algorithm (EA) that employs a population of exemplars as a starting point for its search, unlike traditional EAs, which employ a randomly-generated initial population. The EA, operating on this population, is then used to generate new potentially creative solutions. GENCAD has been instantiated in the domains of structural design of tall buildings and feng shui-compliant residential floor-plan design. The MEXICA model of computational creativity also begins with a set of exemplars as a starting point, but it analyzes these exemplars based on a domain theory. The generalized model that is obtained from analyzing the set of exemplars is then used to guide the generation of new solutions. MEXICA has been instantiated in the domain of plot generation for stories involving themes, characters and locations from the Mexica culture of ancient Mexico. In the hybrid model, we combine the two original models to generate plots for stories of the same sort that MEXICA generates, but using GENCAD's process model to do so. To confirm that the generated plots make sense, the hybrid model integrates commonsense knowledge into its evaluation module.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Critical Systems Thinking (CST) is a systems approach that aims to assist decision&#x2010;makers to better understand and address the complex issues they face. This chapter looks at the origins and early development of CST. A brief account of the state of Systems Thinking (ST) in the early 1980s is necessary to discern the reasons for the emergence of the approach. The development of CST is then traced to 1991. By that time, it had become formalised around a set of three commitments, to which it has largely remained true. The first, &#x2018;systemic critique&#x2019;, insists that all systems approaches are partial, and this leads to their different strengths and weaknesses. The second, &#x2018;systemic pluralism&#x2019;, suggests that the maximum benefit can be obtained by using systems methodologies in combination during an intervention. The third, &#x2018;systemic improvement&#x2019;, explains what improvement means in systems terms and how it can be pursued. The case is then made for CST to embrace a fourth commitment, to &#x2018;systemic pragmatism&#x2019;. It is argued that this can support the other three and take CST forward.</p>},

  abstract={In recent years there is a growing interest in including programming activities in education, emphasizing the importance of children developing computer thinking since early ages. Block-based programming environments scaffold children to explore and learn programming in an easier way. In this paper we present a project supported by a theoretical framework that mobilizes constructionism, the maker movement, tinkering, and project-based learning, and a practical framework based on workshops with primary teachers. Primary school children developed computational thinking and creative computing skills, while they design and present ideas to turn their city a smart city. Results show the quality of the products developed using programming and robots and the impact that this approach can have in authentic learning.},

  abstract={Student who possess several qualities of intelligence and critical thinking skills are believed to think independently. To develop overall skills for a student, it is required that a student demonstrate his knowledge, skills, and abilities in a various ways i.e., through multiple choice questions, fill the gaps, problem solving, short and long answers. Assessment of short and long/essay answers is hectic and tedious tasks for several teachers. Learning Management Systems provide an opportunity to learn online. To develop critical thinking in an online environment, it is necessary to conduct exams and assessment online. Most online LMS tools support assessment through multiple choice questions, but these tools test only higher order thinking skills. Many researchers have tried to provide a system to automatically assess short and long/essay answers using several different approaches. The objective of survey is to highlight problems associated with the evaluator, discuss difficulties and limitations of online tools. In this literature, the methodologies used to develop various models of short answer grading given by several authors and their results are discussed. This paper highlights drawbacks/difficulties with automatic short answers grading. Authors tried to discuss the scope for researchers in this field of automated grading using machine learning algorithms. Authors recommend researchers to conduct an experiment in hybrid and feedback supported systems for grading answers.},

  abstract={Intrinsic Motivation Inventory is a self-report instrument used to assess participants' experience regarding a particular activity. This paper examined the psychometric properties of a revised Intrinsic Motivation Inventory in the context of computational thinking learning. A total of 400 students from 4th grade participated in the pilot study. The revised instrument measured students' intrinsic motivation from four dimensions: interest/enjoyment, perceived competence, value/usefulness, and relatedness. The main findings of the study are twofold: (1) primary school students showed moderate to high motivation to learn computational thinking through programming and CS Unplugged; (2) factor analysis revealed that single factor model and multifactor model had good fit indices. However, discriminant validity of multifactor model was poor, suggesting the existence of a general factor.},

  abstract={This Research-to-Practice full paper presents an exploratory study investigating the impact of using a Bee-Bot educational robot simulator to enhance learning sequencing concepts and student motivation among Macao primary school students. Sequencing in computational thinking (CT) is understanding and applying the logical order of steps in problem-solving processes. We introduced a Bee-Bot computer simulator for children to learn sequencing. Our study adopted a pretest-posttest method involving 35 grade two students. The Computational Thinking Test for Beginners (BCTt) was used to assess CT abilities, and the Instructional Materials Motivation Survey (IMMS) was utilized to measure learning motivation. We found a significant improvement in sequencing ability and more advanced CT concepts (loops and conditions) and a significant correlation between those concepts. Departing from the existing literature, we delved deeper into how Bee-Bot's influence on sequencing extended to more advanced CT concepts. Moreover, considering the ARCS motivation model, this study examined how Bee-Bot affects learning motivation at the primary education level. After the intervention, the findings revealed that the students showed significantly higher learning motivation, meaning that the different learning activities using the Bee-Bot simulator positively influenced various sub-dimensions of the ARCS model: attention, relevance, confidence, and satisfaction. The correlation between the IMMS scores and the BCTt outcomes further suggested that enhanced motivation positively correlated with better CT abilities.},

Among the six math topics, only statistics and calculus significantly contribute to projecting popularity. In addition, noncore programming elements, including sound and look, are widely adapted across various math topics and contribute significantly to project popularity. Although some studies discussed the integration of computation thinking (CT) and math in the classrooms, scant research focuses on the effect of math topics on CT element adoption for achieving better integration in the creative learning context.

  abstract={Can digital competencies be acquired by solving real problems? The educational intervention MadeByKids called an external educational provider to 17 schools to conduct a series of workshops, having pupils age 7 - 12 solve challenges such as designing the schoolbag 4.0 or the future classroom. The workshops were designed by adopting the Stanford Design Thinking Method for Kids (http://www.ideaco.org) and digital technologies with the goal to “teach” children computational thinking, collaborating in teams, resolving conflicts, presenting, giving/receiving feedback, etc. In this paper, we take a participatory action research (PAR) approach with the goal of exposing significant chunks of the incredibly rich experience. A content analysis of a qualitative survey among teachers and findings from a focus group reflect the teachers' view. The study indicates that the acquisition of digital competences needs to be backed by personal and social capacities that take time to mature. Furthermore, we learned that the children's teachers must be included consistently to ensure their cooperation and improve sustainability. Besides providing inspiration for teachers, implications for teacher education are derived and the national project is related to the findings from studies conducted abroad in order to contribute to constructive educational innovations crossing national boundaries.},

  abstract={This research paper examined theories, pedagogics, and contents explored by studies focusing on promoting computational thinking (CT) in higher education institutions (HEIs). CT has become a fundamental approach to building problem-solving skills, which requires a thought process. The field of CT is generally still maturing, and the use of CT as an approach to introduce freshmen to introductory programming courses in HEIs has been gaining scholars' interest in the recent past. To appreciate the strategies explored to promote teaching and learning of CT in HEIs; evaluate scholarly discussions, contributions, and potential impact of studies in this field, there is a need to ground the theoretical constructs that build the foundation for the field. A literature review methodology was adopted in this study. The data collected from the Web of Science, the Scopus, ACM, and ProQuest databases were analyzed to provide answers to the research questions. The findings from this study suggest that constructionism and constructivism are the prevailing learning theories explored by scholars in this field to deploy CT in HEI. Additionally, the study revealed that activity-based learning, problem-based learning, automatic assessment-based learning, and self-regulated or self-reflective learning are the prominent pedagogies used by educators. These findings provided a strong foundation for research in this growing field. Besides, the findings also create an opportunity for positioning CT in HEI's educational curriculum regarding how CT should be taught in that context.},

  abstract={While programming has been recognized as an engaging way to enhance students’ learning, implementing programming in K-12 education remains challenging, particularly when it requires access to digital devices or the internet. Therefore, it’s essential to consider more accessible methods for teaching crucial programming skills. Given this situation, we turned to unplugged computational thinking (CT) activities to foster interest and develop skills in programming. By introducing programming concepts through unplugged CT activities, this research significantly contributed to the growth of interest and the development of skills among secondary school students. Two hundred and thirty lower secondary school students volunteered to participate in the intervention using a designed unplugged CT activity framework. The CT activities framework consists of four components: puzzles, the Bebras Computing Challenge, problem-solving, and programming concepts. Four schools participated in three- to four-day interventions for four to five hours daily. Quantitative data collection was performed using pre- and post-surveys before and after the intervention phase. A paired sample t-test and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests indicated the p-value < 0.05 suggested a significant improvement in interest and programming skills. An overall findings implied that the unplugged CT activities enhanced students’ understanding of CT as well as improved their interest and programming skills.},

  abstract={The advancement in Microelectromechanical System (MEMS) technology resulted in accurate and high-performance miniature device systems. These devices are so tiny that they are not noticeable by the human eye and exhibit excellent feasibility in miniaturization sensors due to their small dimensions, low power consumption, and superior performance. The area of sci-ence and engineering where MEMS are developed (dimensions in the manometer scale) is called Nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is one of the fastest growing scientific research related to Industry 4.0. Nanotechnology may introduce industrial skills deficits as well as opportunities for new teaching practices in several subjects and educational frameworks. In the present work, we investigate the attitude of STEM (i.e. technology/engineering) and non STEM - related instructors, regarding the integration of Nanotechnology applications in Higher education curricula. Their opinions, concerning the applied teaching method, the learning content material and expected student skills, should always be taken in to account, as they may boost any reformations proposed. Moreover, we propose a repository platform, with which instructors may interact with 3D designs and MEMs mate-rial to built their didactic plans. This work's findings is critical for the design and innovative training material and computational thinking (CT) activities, which will prepare student with skills related to Industry 4.0 demand.},

  abstract={This research to practice work in progress paper explores changes in teachers' knowledge of integrating computational thinking (CT) into early childhood education in a professional learning (PL) initiative. The main goal of the program is to prepare teachers to develop CT practices into early childhood learning environments by fostering several key components: recognizing the significance of CT development from early childhood, applying pedagogical practices (i.e. unplugged activities, Use-Modify-Create), identifying socially constructed roles and stereotypes surrounding toys, implications of screen and device usage in learning, and developing skills to design CT learning activities tailored for their own classroom settings. To achieve our goals, the research team designed, implemented, and evaluated an online 30-hour PL program with educators from Latin American countries. Approximately 80 teachers completed the online PL program. The participating teachers engaged with the PL program weekly by providing written journal reflections. In the final week, they were asked to design a lesson based on what they learned and implement it into their classroom. Teachers completed a pre- and post-survey surrounding their self-efficacy and technological, pedagogical, and content knowledge (TPACK) in CT. Data sources include pre- and post-surveys, teacher journal reflections, and lesson plans developed by teachers. In this paper, we analyzed their journal reflections to qualitatively develop an understanding of how teachers progressed in the PL. The lesson plans will be analyzed to identify: (1) the learning goals for the students, (2) which activities teachers preferred to implement, and (3) how they assessed student learning in CT in their classroom. Preliminary findings demonstrate the types of CT activities they implemented in their classrooms. Teachers also created lessons that met their students' needs which further provides examples of how CT is integrated within the existing curriculum surrounding student interest and culture. Many PL programs often teach about CT concepts, but do not offer a chance to implement a lesson plan and reflect on their experience. This process helps teachers develop self-efficacy for teaching CT in an elementary classroom and teachers reported that they would continue to integrate CT within their future instruction. Also, this program contributes to the reduction of the gender gap in CT, promoting equitable practices in early childhood education.},

The core principle employed by this model is that different knowledge from various level cases can be explicitly explored and integrated into a practical design process.},

The App aims to teach children the basics of Computational Thinking (CT) in a playful way. The gameplay expects the young children to steer successfully their in-game character with the help of an intuitive symbol language through a set of increasingly complex mazes. The children may even draw sets of symbols by hand thus develop a basic program. Pic2Programs image recognition module will then process these symbols by first photographing them with an Android device and then using a neural network to map the photos to program instructions. The effectivity of Pic2Program on learning CT has been evaluated by a designed course for 9th, graders. The results show that students find the App well-structured and help them to understand the basics of programming.},

  abstract={Aspiring software developers, like the novice students in Computer Science courses, need to acquire a thorough understanding of fundamental computational concepts like sequential execution, conditional branching, loops, modularisation, hierarchy and reuse. This understanding and "computational thinking" is deepened when they encounter the concepts in different contexts and environments, as opposed to only in one traditional programming language. In this paper, we describe how we used the Cinco Adventure Game Tool, a tool that allows students to model simple browser games in an intuitive graphical framework, to train basic computational concepts in a creative and engaging, learning-by-doing fashion. On purpose, we steered away from traditional programming languages, in order to separate the use of the concepts and constructs from the hurdle of a programming language syntax and development environment. The experiences with a large group of first-term Computer Science students in two successive years were very positive: The students had no problems in understanding and using the concepts, used the tool proficiently and enjoyed designing and modelling the games. Working together on a game project in small groups, they showed sustained engagement, developed a high level of confidence, and created quite complex games containing various fundamental computational constructs.},

  abstract={Fast Delivery is an educational game designed to facilitate the learning of computational thinking and development of logic, teaching the basic pillars that would be sentences, conditionals and cycles through an entertaining and innovative tool. Fast Delivery facilitates the resolution of programs because it is written in a textual programming language through a simple and intuitive pseudocode in the Spanish language. The game employs a gamified approach where users answer coding questions displayed on the screen by selecting code fragments from boxes to complete the given code. Using various associated techniques, such as gamification mechanics that will be lives and scores. And also the behavioral instruction technique that will work through visual and auditory stimuli. To evaluate the effects of the game use on learning and motivation, a study was carried out with students from a Chilean educational school. The results show that some students presented an overall learning gain, while others performed worse in the posttest than in the pretest. A motivational questionnaire based in the Self-determination Theory, supports the idea that students perceived the activity as difficult, lowering their sense of autonomy and competence, raising pressure, and thus negatively affecting motivation. Results by learning objective suggest that higher learnings were obtained for decision structures rather than for cycles and arithmetic operations with variables.},

  abstract={Collaborative learning has proven to be a productive approach across domains including computer science. Especially for novices, collaboration among learners with diverse experiences, values, and knowledge can be especially effective. However, there is limited research on how collaborative interactions among learners from different undergraduate disciplines manifest during the learning of computational concepts. This qualitative study investigates interaction among learners in small interdisciplinary student groups in an undergraduate computational thinking (CT) class. In analyzing the social interactions of cohort members, the Differentiating Overt Learning Activities (DOLA) framework developed by Chi was used as a starting point. Several themes (e.g. explain-to-other, self-monitor, connect/plan) suggested by Chi’s overt activities framework emerged naturally in the observations. However, several categories that were not explicitly stated in the DOLA framework also emerged. These are: asking a shallow question versus asking an elaborate question, socializing, being confused or expressing frustration, self-talk, and struggle. Analysis of interactions between cohort members revealed that most of the group interactions were active in nature. Barriers to collaborative learning were accentuated when peers were novices. Students who lacked knowledge of computational concepts found it hard to contribute to a discussion, hindering learning, whereas students who had better conceptual understanding were constructive in their interactions, elaborated on a topic, made connections with previous problems, and displayed self-awareness about their understanding.},

We propose that the human thought process, which is the fundamental unit for the human mind and all the different emotions coming from it, can be implemented as a mathematical formula to a reasonable extent. Furthermore, we argue that our model has the ability to derive mind functions such as dreams and thinking. The model utilizes a top-down approach for understanding the factors involved in the thought process while explaining the factors involved. The authors are intending to make continuous improvements in the formulae as more scientific advances happen in the understanding of the human cognitive functions.},

  abstract={ACM Ubiquity hosted a symposium in 2010–2011 on Turing's question, ‘What is computation?’ The editor reflects on how the symposium was organized and what conclusions it reached. The authors showed strong consensus around the propositions that computation is a process, computational model matters, many computations are natural, many important computations are continuous, many important computations are nonterminating and computational thinking has emerged as a core practice of computing. They left open the questions of whether the Turing model is the best reference model, is computational necessarily a physical process, what is information and what is an algorithm.},

  abstract={Engaging youngsters with ancient approaches in education, especially reading, grows ever tougher in the face of their attachment to tablets and PC games. In this paper, we explore the digital storytelling more interesting and memorable for children. Digital storytelling is recognized as a motivating instructional approach that engages learners in 21st century learning skills which will be essential to success in the future. Digital storytelling is one of the latest pedagogical approaches that can engage learners in computational thinking. Educators are in search of recent technologies and education approaches to engage students in computational thinking. Digital storytelling using MIT Scratch have the potential to meet this demand.},

  abstract={Proposes a query expansion method using fuzzy abductive inference for a creative thinking support system. This query expansion method for information retrieval is useful, because unexpected related information can probably be obtained by adding new words to the query. The fuzzy abductive inference is the inference method based on Peng and Reggia's (1990) abductive inference. This method infers nonredundant combinations of concept words for the query. This paper also studies how to update the weights of concept-term relationships by the steepest descent method.},

  abstract={In this paper we present an interactive learning environment (ILE) called CRA y JUEGA, focused on the development of computational thinking skills using block-based visual language programing with a 3D physics simulation system. It includes a programmable interaction system based on hand movement and gesture recognition, that allows to easily create and use customized hand gestures for interaction with 3D objects in a virtual environment. By applying the TAM model to discover the motivation, enjoyment and behavioral intention to use, the results show that: (1) using NUI technologies in interactive learning environments improve the enjoyment and the perceived ease of use; (2) perceived enjoyment was a significant issue in the intention to use; (3) NUIs interfaces during exercises could provide motivation to learn for middle school students.},

  abstract={This paper introduces a new model of artificial cognitive architecture for intelligent systems, the Neuromodulating Cognitive Architecture (NEUCOGAR). The model is bio mimetically inspired and adapts the neuromodulators role of human brains into computational environments. This way we aim at achieving more efficient Artificial Intelligence solutions based on the biological inspiration of the deep functioning of human brain, which is highly emotional. The analysis of new data obtained from neurology, psychology philosophy and anthropology allows us to generate a mapping of monoamine neuro modulators and to apply it to computational system parameters. Artificial cognitive systems can then better perform complex tasks (regarding information selection and discrimination, attention, innovation, creativity) as well as engaging in affordable emotional relationships with human users.},
