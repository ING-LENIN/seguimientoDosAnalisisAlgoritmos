N2 - Objectives: In the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment, the emergence of therapeutic failures with existing antiretroviral drugs presents a significant challenge. This study aims to employ advanced molecular modeling techniques to identify potential alternatives to current antiretroviral agents. Methods: The study focuses on three essential classes of antiretroviral drugs: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs). Computational analyses were performed on a database of 3,343,652 chemical molecules to evaluate their binding affinities, pharmacokinetic properties, and interactions with viral reverse transcriptase and protease enzymes. Molecular docking, virtual screening, and 3D pharmacophore modeling were utilized to identify promising candidates. Results: Molecular docking revealed compounds with high binding energies and strong interactions at the active sites of target enzymes. Virtual screening narrowed down potential candidates with favorable pharmacological profiles. 3D pharmacophore modeling identified crucial structural features for effective binding. Overall, two molecules for class 1, 7 molecules for class 2, and 2 molecules for class 3 were selected. These compounds exhibited robust binding affinities, interactions with target enzymes, and improved pharmacokinetic properties, showing promise for more effective HIV treatments in cases of therapeutic failures. Conclusion: The combination of molecular docking, virtual screening, and 3D pharmacophore modeling yielded lead compounds that hold potential for addressing HIV therapeutic failures. Further experimental investigations are essential to validate the efficacy and safety of these compounds, with the ultimate goal of advancing toward clinical applications in HIV management.

N2 - This paper studies the law of the Lie algebras associated with a particular type of Lie groups: the Lie groups formed by all the upper-triangular matrices without zeros in their main diagonal. Indeed, these laws are obtained by means of a computational algorithm which we have constructed and particularly implemented by using the symbolic computation package MAPLE. Besides, the complexity of this algorithm is studied by considering the number of computations carried out with this implementation.

N2 - A composite material (CM) of periodic structure with the peristatic properties of constituents, as proposed by Silling, is analyzed by a generalization of the classical locally elastic computational homogenization to its peristatic counterpart. New volumetric periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) are introduced at the interaction boundary of a representative unit cell (UC). A generalization of the Hill’s equality to peristatic composites is proved. The general results establishing the links between the effective moduli and the corresponding mechanical influence functions are obtained. The discretization of the equilibrium equation acts as a macro-to-micro transition of the deformation-driven type, where the overall deformation is controlled. Determination of the microstructural displacements allows one to estimate the peristatic traction at the geometrical UC’s boundary, which is exploited for estimation of the macroscopic stresses and the effective moduli. The proposed approach is demonstrated computationally through one-dimensional examples.

N2 - This systematic literature review presents the computational methods of human behaviour prediction research from Pentland and Liu’s seminal 1999 paper on human behaviour prediction to the latest research to date. The PRISMA framework for systematic reviews was used as the review methodology to structure this information aggregation. This review provides a high-level summary of the field with key areas identified for new research. The results show that there are frequently used datasets for training predictive models: MavHome, MavLab, LIARA, CASAS, PlaceLab, and REDD. Accuracies in the range of 43.9% to 100% for predictions of varying complexity. Common data structures for modelling behavioural data: Vectors, tables, trees, Markov models, and graphs. Algorithms that fall into three distinct categories: Machine Learning (NN, RL, LSTM), Probabilistic Graphical Models (namely Bayesian and Markov variants), and Statistical and Trend Analysis (ARIMA, Prophet). Additionally, we document other notably useful algorithms that fall outside of these three main categories including Jaro-Winkler and Levenshtein distances. Opportunities identified for further research include the use of audio as the data source for behaviour prediction methods, and applying times-series prediction machine learning algorithms (RNN, LSTM) to the smart home problem space.

N2 - We address the problem of DOA estimation in positioning of nodes in wireless sensor networks. The Stochastic Maximum Likelihood (SML) algorithm is adopted in this paper. The SML algorithm is well-known for its high resolution of DOA estimation. However, its computational complexity is very high because multidimensional nonlinear optimization problem is usually involved. To reduce the computational complexity of SML estimation, we do the following work. (1) We point out the problems of conventional SML criterion and explain why and how these problems happen. (2) A local AM search method is proposed which could be used to find the local solution near/around the initial value. (3) We propose an algorithm which uses the local AM search method together with the estimation of DML or MUSIC as initial value to find the solution of SML. Simulation results are shown to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithms. In particular, the algorithm which uses the local AM method and estimation of MUSIC as initial value has much higher resolution and comparable computational complexity to MUSIC.

N2 - This study investigates how collective corruption appears, using a computational method. Specifically, acknowledging that the characteristics of collective corruption process are analogous to percolation phenomena, we illuminate that collective corruption is formed by ongoing social interactions in an organizational boundary. By formulating a percolation-based system dynamics model, we consider the behavioral characteristics of collective corruption in terms of individuals’ corruption preferences governed by personal attributes on corruption. We also propose and examine scenarios regarding the formation of collective corruption.

N2 - In this paper, a computational fluid dynamics trimming method is proposed and compared with wind tunnel experiment and the blade element method. The NASA’s generic ROBIN helicopter model is adopted for transient simulations to obtain the final main rotor trimming conditions. Totally three steps were applied to the computational fluid dynamics method. The first step is associated with no cyclic pitch motion, the second is regarding pure longitudinal cyclic pitch motion and the last is concerning with pure lateral cyclic pitch motion. At the same time, a simple linear equation system between the roll and pitching moment was established to get the final longitudinal and lateral cyclic pitch angles for the main rotor through the above three steps. An overset grid approach was used where the volume around each blade was modeled in an individual overset grid region. The rotor rotation was resolved with three degrees per time-step. Turbulence was modeled with the well-known SST K-omega model with second-order convection. The helicopter was in straight forward flight with an advance ratio of . Three sources of stick angles, which are also called rotor trimming angles, were shown and compared with each other. And the corresponding results were also plotted with a type of history plot in the computational fluid dynamics condition. In the simulations, the results became quasi periodic after about 1.5 rotations and four rotor rotations were simulated for each case. The pitch moment coefficient and roll moment coefficient were all trimmed to about zero by the computational fluid dynamics trimming method while moments were not removed thoroughly in the other two source conditions.

N2 - Gain modulation is a nonlinear way in which neurons combine information from two (or more) sources, which may be of sensory, motor, or cognitive origin. Gain modulation is revealed when one input, the modulatory one, affects the gain or the sensitivity of the neuron to the other input, without modifying its selectivity or receptive field properties. This type of modulatory interaction is important for two reasons. First, it is an extremely widespread integration mechanism; it is found in a plethora of cortical areas and in some subcortical structures as well, and as a consequence it seems to play an important role in a striking variety of functions, including eye and limb movements, navigation, spatial perception, attentional processing, and object recognition. Second, there is a theoretical foundation indicating that gain-modulated neurons may serve as a basis for a general class of computations, namely, coordinate transformations and the generation of invariant responses, which indeed may underlie all the brain functions just mentioned. This article describes the relationships between computational models, the physiological properties of a variety of gain-modulated neurons, and some of the behavioral consequences of damage to gain-modulated neural representations.

N2 - The blood pump is an implantable device with strict performance requirements. Any effective structural improvement will help to improve the treatment of patients. However, the research of blood pump structure improvement is a complex optimization problem with multiple parameters and objectives. This study takes the splitter blade as the object of structural improvement. Computational fluid mechanics and neural networks are combined in research and optimization. And hydraulic experiments and micro particle image velocimetry technology were used. In the optimization study, the number of blades, axial length and circumferential offset are optimization parameters, and hydraulic performance and hemolytic prediction index are optimization targets. The study analyzes the influence of each parameter on performance and completes the optimization of the parameters. In the results, the optimal parameters of number of blades, axial length ratio, and circumferential offset are 2.6° and 0.41°, respectively. Under optimized parameters, hydraulic performance can be significantly improved. And the results of hemolysis prediction and micro particle image velocimetry experiments reflect that there is no increase in the risk of hemolytic damage. The results of this study provide a method and ideas for improving the structure of the axial spiral blade blood pump. The established optimization method can be effectively applied to the design and research of axial spiral blade blood pumps with complex, high precision, and multiple parameters and targets.
