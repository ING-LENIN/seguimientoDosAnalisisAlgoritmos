abstract = {The main aim of the work was to investigate a simplified finite element simulation of the out-of-plane distortion caused by fusion butt welding. The thermal transient part of the simulation made use of a finite element analysis of the two-dimensional cross-section of the weld joint and the thermoelastic-plastic treatment was based on analytical algorithms describing transverse and longitudinal deformations, leading to predictions of transverse angular deformation and longitudinal contraction force. These results were then applied to a non-linear elastic finite element model to provide predictions of the final angular and overall deformations of the butt-welded plates. The validity of the simulation was investigated via full-scale tests on 4m x 1.4m x 5 mm steel plates, butt welded using a flux-cored Ar-CO2 metal-inert gas process. Thermography and thermocouple arrays were used to validate the thermal transient computations and out-of-plane deformations were measured using displacement transducers for transient deformations and a laser scanning system to measure the profiles of the whole plates before and after welding. The results of six full-scale tests are given and comparison with the simulations shows that the procedure provides good prediction of the angular and overall out-of-plane deformations. Prediction accuracy requires account to be taken of initial shape, gravity loading, and support conditions.}

abstract = {This paper compares the use of scripting languages and visual programming languages for teaching computational design concepts to novice and advanced architecture students. Both systems are described and discussed in terms of the representation methods they use. With novice students better results were obtained with the visual programming language. However, the generative strategies used were restricted to parametric variation and the use of randomness. Scripting, on the other hand, was used by advanced students to implement rule-based generative systems. It is possible to conclude that visual languages can be very useful for making architecture students understand general programming concepts, but scripting languages are fundamental for implementing generative design systems. The paper also discusses the importance of the ability to shift between different representation methods, from more concrete to more abstract, as part of the architectural education.}

abstract = {Learning programming is a painful process for most students, especially those learning text- based programming languages. In this study, based on the principle of Bandura’s social learning theory, the vicarious real-life experiences of several pioneers in the field of IT and programming were presented as 15-minutes stories to a group of 9th graders learning to code in Python. A quasi-experimental research design was used to examine the effects of the theory and associated technique on student achievement. The 27 participants in the experiment group watched these presentations before engaging in programming activities while a control group were also observed who received no extra motivational intervention. Those in the experiment group were found to have significantly improved their programming achievement compared to those in the control group. Additionally, the functionality and originality of the experimental group projects were significantly better than those produced in the control group. They reported that they had been motivated by the pioneer stories, and their interest and self-efficacy beliefs in relation to creating high level programming projects were increased. The results highlight the benefits obtained from proper application of a “pioneer-story technique” to improve text-based programming skills.}

abstract = {The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) for K-12 science education has outlined new standards that integrate science inquiry practices with scientific concepts and ideas. The challenge with implementing this framework has been determining how to provide students with authentic scientific experiences and real-time individualized scaffolding during inquiry, as well as reliably and validly assess students’ inquiry competencies. This article reviews current computer-based educational technologies, namely, educational data mining and natural language processing, and describes how these technologies have been used to automatically assess science inquiry practices aligned with NGSS practices. The second section describes the implementation of real-time adaptive, individualized scaffolds and instruction, based on automated inquiry assessment techniques. Finally, we aim to direct the attention of policy makers toward the use of technology to promote significant progress of nationwide inquiry-based learning, teaching, and assessment.}

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small, noncoding RNA molecules that regulate transcriptional and posttranscriptional gene regulation of the cell. Experimental evidence shows that miRNAs have a direct role in different cellular processes, such as immune function, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis. In a viral infection context, miRNAs have been connected with the interplay between host and pathogen, occupying a major role in pathogenesis. While numerous viral miRNAs from DNA viruses have been identified, characterization of functional RNA virus-encoded miRNAs and their potential targets is still ongoing. Here, we used an in silico approach to analyze dengue Virus genome sequences. Pre-miRNAs were extracted through VMir software, and the identification of putative pre-miRNAs and mature miRNAs was accessed using Support Vector Machine web tools. The targets were scanned using miRanda software and functionally annotated using ClueGo. Via computational tools, eight putative miRNAs were found to hybridize with numerous targets of morphogenesis, differentiation, migration, and growth pathways that may play a major role in the interaction of the virus and its host. Future approaches will focus on experimental validation of their presence and target messenger RNA genes to further elucidate their biological functions in human and mosquito cells.}

abstract = {The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in journalism has sparked complex ethical debates, particularly with the rise of generative AI systems. By now, AI permeates the entire news cycle, from information gathering to news dissemination, raising questions revolving around issues such as transparency, accountability, responsibility, bias, and diversity. Previous research showed that news organizations have slowly approached and adapted to ethical concerns regarding the use of AI, developing critical stances mainly due to rising AI power, growing audience skepticism, and mounting tensions within the industry between news publishers’ strategies and journalists’ anxieties. Consequently, ethical guidelines have started to emerge in news organizations, but their practical application remains challenging and under-studied, not only due to the opacity of AI algorithms, but also due to the difficulties of “embedding” journalistic values into AI systems. In the light of an intensifying discourse about ethical concerns in the news industry and growing efforts by governments and institutions such as the European Union to strengthen AI governance, journalism studies have started to explore the issue as well. However, research on AI ethics is still in its infancy, with significant gaps in understanding the practical enforcement of ethical guidelines within newsrooms, in particular when it comes to the design of AI systems. This essay critically discusses the way journalism (studies) approach ethical issues related to the use and the design of AI systems, given that the responsible use and design of AI systems in journalism is crucial given its integral role for democracy and society.}

For each of these trends, we shortly explain their implications and potential use such as for interpretation in psychological studies and usage in digital health and digital psychology applications. We also discuss further potential development.}

Here, we examine the applications of next-generation sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools to study the molecular evolution of aquatic animals and discuss the current challenges and future perspectives of using bioinformatics toward aquatic animal conservation efforts.}
