abstract = {New information and computer technologies transform the social interaction and impose new demands for skills and thinking upon media specialists. The aim of this study is to determine the most effective set of information technologies, which can help media specialists develop competencies and thus stay competitive in the labor market. The research methodology is based on the overview of case studies concerning issues such as technology trends, human capital, and talent competitiveness. The qualitative analysis was performed in three phases – overviewing case studies, distinguishing trends and problem-solving. Analyzing data on skill supply and demand, the key skills needed to succeed in the workplace were identified. The results of the three-phase research revealed that the most important competencies needed to be in demand today are technology literacy, stress tolerance, and big data skills. The major finding of this study is that a media specialist needs to focus on learning throughout his life and gain hard and soft skills in the process.}

abstract = {Hybrid girihs refer to Islamic geometric patterns that include various stars/rosettes in their final pattern. In this paper, we first identified historical hybrid girihs and then categorized them based on symmetry groups and the number of stars/rosettes folds. In the next step, we analyzed the existing hybrid girihs to identify the generative parameters and present a method for generating historical and novel systematic and non-systematic hybrid girihs. The proposed method of this paper is a computational and parametric approach based on the symmetry groups theory. Its general steps include generating the minimal essential information (template motif) within the fundamental region, applying appropriate symmetry operations on the content of the fundamental region to create the content of the unit girih, and replicating the content of the unit girih in a suitable network according to the symmetry group to create the whole pattern. Our method is used to generate hybrid girih for adorning surfaces in digital spaces and for constructing facade modules (adorned with Islamic geometric patterns) and interior decorative partitions and furniture in physical spaces according to the aesthetic judgment of users.}

abstract = {Critical thinking is routinely identified as a goal for student learning in higher education. Critical thinking, however, is difficult to define or teach, often left as an educational aspiration that is challenging to operationalize and assess. Therefore, many interventions targeting critical thinking are isolated and tend to focus on the development of cognitive skills, providing less attention to students’ dispositions toward applying these skills to different situations. In this study of a redesigned course at a research-intensive university, we query what a dispositional view of thinking can reveal about students’ understanding and experience in an active learning environment. Drawing on student reflection journals and semi-structured interviews with 13 students from two cohorts of the course, we trace how students decide when and how critical thinking is necessary and suitable, as well as when it is perceived to be too demanding or out of place in the classroom. The course included newly introduced, ill-structured problems aimed at competency development. We note that although students employed many critical thinking skills to complete these tasks, the uncertainty related to applying critical thinking to ill-structured problems often conflicted with students’ expectations of classroom instruction. When adapting to unfamiliar instructional practices, students were largely successful in using different approaches to solve problems. However, students’ sensitivity to error and tendency toward familiar ways of being students were barriers to the solidification of critical thinking habits. We argue that to foster long-lasting critical thinking skills and dispositions, education interventions need to shift from the course to the program level and move toward the development of broader cultures of thinking.}

abstract = {Coding is increasingly popular in schools around the world and is often taught by non-specialist teachers as an integrated task with other subject areas. In this article, we explore the relationship between computer science (CS) concepts and students’ multimodal expression in a coding animated narrative (CAN) task in the context of an integrated English-Technology unit of learning. Through this collective case study, we explore how CS concepts underpin semiotic elements of an animated narrative, analyse the factors that influence the extent to which students exercise those concepts, and reveal the tensions and opportunities that a CAN task may present for learning computer science concepts in regular, non-specialist, cross-curricular classrooms. The findings suggest that CAN tasks are unique in presenting opportunities for students to learn challenging CS concepts such as synchronisation and parallelism. At the same time, CAN tasks present tensions for teaching CS concepts in non-specialist classrooms, where student projects are often judged on their visual qualities. In such settings, procedural, rather than conceptual knowledge, may be a more efficient route to creative outcomes. It also means that drawing skills need to be prioritised. Role specialisation often led to better quality projects but at the expense of individual students’ conceptual development in computer science.}
