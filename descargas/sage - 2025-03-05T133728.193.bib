N2 - A novel adaptive fuzzy control approach with low computational costs is addressed for the longitudinal non-affine model of a generic hypersonic vehicle subject to parametric uncertainties, capable of guaranteeing that altitude and velocity tracking errors exhibit prescribed performance. A new performance function is devised to impose preselected bounds on the transient and steady-state tracking error performance, and then a transformed error is constructed, which converts the original “constrained” system into an equivalent “unconstrained” one for the simplicity of control designs. Furthermore, a simplified fuzzy controller is exploited for the altitude subsystem, eliminating the issue of “explosion of complexity” that is associated with back-stepping control. For the velocity subsystem, a prescribed performance-based proportional–integral controller is utilized. The special contributions of the proposed control strategy are that it can guarantee altitude and velocity tracking errors with desired transient and steady-state performance, and meanwhile the computational load is quite low. Finally, numerical simulation results are presented to verify the efficiency of the design.

N2 - Accumulating evidence from cognitive neuroscience indicates that the right inferior parietal cortex, at the junction with the posterior temporal cortex, plays a critical role in various aspects of social cognition such as theory of mind and empathy. With a quantitative meta-analysis of 70 functional neuroimaging studies, the authors demonstrate that this area is also engaged in lower-level (bottom-up) computational processes associated with the sense of agency and reorienting attention to salient stimuli. It is argued that this domain-general computational mechanism is crucial for higher level social cognitive processing. NEUROSCIENTIST 13(6): 580—593, 2007. DOI: 10.1177/1073858407304654

N2 - In this paper the characteristics and performance are described of a computational process model (CPM) of human way-finding that is based on psychological models of cognition and experimental data on human way-finding. The model comprises two modules, one for representing objectively a suburban environment and the other for representing the cognitive processes involved in navigation. The CPM is employed to simulate and investigate how spatial knowledge that has been acquired and stored is retrieved and processed in order to plan a path to a given goal. The results of the experiments carried out with NAVIGATOR are compared with the results of experiments involving young adults in real environments. We analyze the performance of NAVIGATOR in terms of its ability to find the goal, the amount of time taken to reach a given goal, the differences in performance during way-finding, and the errors in navigation, as a function of several parameters. The parameters are intended to represent key psychological components of human perceptual and cognitive systems and are derived from experimental studies of human way-finding behavior. The main value of this model lies in its use as a device for investigating and understanding human spatial performance, in terms of accurate performance and errors that arise in tasks of way-finding, and the variations among individuals in terms of performance. A set of computational experiments are used to examine the differences in search strategies between ‘individuals’. The effects of various parameters on way-finding performance are analyzed. Errors in way-finding are classified and are compared with Norman’s and Reason’s classification of errors in human performance. The CPM appears to provide a fruitful model for investigating human way-finding behavior.

N2 - The theory of Green’s functions for the wave and Helmholtz equations is examined with particular attention to their use in aeroacoustics for the extrapolation of acoustic wavefields from numerical flow simulations. In a new synthesis that permits straightforward generalization of previously published results, spatial and temporal windowing functions are employed to provide equivalent-source expressions to account for both initial and boundary conditions. Detailed results describe the transformation of both source terms and Green’s functions to take account of uniform subsonic mean flow, and expressions are given for free-field Green’s functions, both with and without flow, in time, frequency and wavenumber domains. A worked example illustrates the non-uniqueness of the Green’s function for a simple one-dimensional bounded problem.

N2 - This article proposes a Rayleigh’s quotient–based damage detection algorithm. It aims at efficiently revealing nascent structural changes on a given structure with the capability to differentiate between an actual damage and a change in operational conditions. The first three damage detection levels are targeted: existence, location, and severity. The proposed algorithm is analytically developed from the dynamics theory and the virtual energy principle. Some computational techniques are proposed for carrying out computations, including discretization, integration, derivation, and suitable optimization methods. Field implementation strategies are also considered for the purpose of online damage monitoring. In order to prove the efficiency of this strategy, one experimental and three numerical case studies were conducted. The proposed algorithm successfully detected the damage in all simulated cases and estimated the damage severity with acceptable accuracy. The conclusion is that the proposed algorithm was able to efficiently detect damage appearance in a range of structures for various damage levels and locations, and under different operational conditions.

N2 - This paper presents a computationally efficient Bayesian inference framework and its application to infer damage in truss bridges. The novelty of the proposed framework for reducing the computational burden of Bayesian inference of structural damage lies in (a) the revised transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for efficiently drawing statistical samples of damage indexes and (b) the likelihood function in the frequency domain based on modal properties that could be derived from the stochastic subspace identification. Other special features of the proposed framework include (a) explicitly modeling complexities of truss joints for allowing identification of truss joint damage and the assessment of its associated uncertainties and (b) incorporating the structural finite element model into the probabilistic inference computational environment through the program application interface. Those improvements make new contributions to the field of damage identification for truss bridges, leading to the practical application of Bayesian inference of the large amounts of potential damage not only in truss members but also in truss joints. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed framework are illustrated and examined by using numerical simulation of a damaged prototype truss structure. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach has the potential capacity for determining the extent and location of large amounts of truss damage and the probabilistic characteristics. Finally, the limitation of this study and the future research need for practical application of the proposed probabilistic framework are discussed.
