N2 - The paper presents computational fluid dynamics-based numerical simulation of the through-thickness air permeability of woven structures, applying the theory of jet systems. The flow through the interstices between the warp and weft threads is modeled as an “in-corridor”-ordered jet system, formed by nine jets, issuing from nine pores of the woven structure. Fifteen cases were simulated and three different turbulence models were applied in the simulation: k-ɛ, k-ω and Reynolds stress model. The five simulated woven structures were manufactured and their air permeability was measured experimentally. The performed validation of the numerical results with the experimental values of the air permeability showed very good correlation with the experimental results. The analysis and the verification showed that the method can be applied for further investigation not only of the woven fabrics’ air permeability, but also for investigation of the flow after a textile barrier of a woven type.

N2 - In this paper, we discuss a computational model that is able to detect and build word-like representations on the basis of sensory input. The model is designed and tested with a further aim to investigate how infants may learn to communicate by means of spoken language. The computational model makes use of a memory, a perception module, and the concept of “learning drive”. Learning takes place within a communicative loop between a “caregiver” and the “learner”. Experiments carried out on three European languages with different genetic background (Finnish, Swedish, and Dutch) show that a robust word representation can be learned in using less than 100 acoustic tokens (examples) of that word. The model is inspired by the memory structure that is assumed functional for human cognitive processing.

N2 - The aim of this paper is to outline a priori performance evaluation approaches for distributed solution concepts of simulation-based optimization problems. Practical optimization problems, a distributed solution approach, and specific characteristics of the situation are presented. This parallel system is then analyzed according to both approaches of computational complexity and scalability. To overcome the resulting drawbacks, the integration of a posteriori aspects is necessary. Thus, a generic metric is established providing a posteriori knowledge at early stages of the optimization process.

N2 - We describe some of the ways that the field of content analysis is being transformed in an Era of Big Data. We argue that content analysis, from its beginning, has been concerned with extracting the main meanings of a text and mapping those meanings onto the space of a textual corpus. In contrast, we suggest that the emergence of new styles of text mining tools is creating an opportunity to develop a different kind of content analysis that we describe as a computational hermeneutics. Here the goal is to go beyond a mapping of the main meaning of a text to mimic the kinds of questions and concerns that have traditionally been the focus of a hermeneutically grounded close reading, a reading that focuses on what Kenneth Burke described as the poetic meanings of a text. We illustrate this approach by referring to our own work concerning the rhetorical character of US National Security Strategy documents.

N2 - The establishment of a healthy indoor environment requires the accurate evaluation of an individual’s exposure to pollutants. The concentration of indoor chemical pollutants is a representative indicator for such evaluation and is generally measured on-site. Moreover, material flow analysis (MFA), using macroscopic statistical data, is a reasonable method for objectively evaluating pollution on a wide scale; however, no effective strategy exists for the prediction of indoor air pollution, nor for the assessment of an individual’s exposure from social stock data. Accordingly, we developed a novel integration method comprising MFA and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with a computer-simulated person (CSP) to establish a framework for evaluating indoor pollutant concentration and individual exposure of residents. We focused on diethyl-hexyl phthalate (DEHP) and first estimated the amount of DEHP-containing product accumulation in Japan by MFA. Second, we conducted a thorough survey and measurement of DEHP emission rates. Using these results as boundary conditions for indoor CFD with CSP, the individual exposure of a resident, in a standard residential house, was quantitatively evaluated. The total daily exposure per unit of body weight was estimated to be more than 100 (μg/kg/d) in the worst-case scenario which was considered the upper limit for exposure in this analysis.

N2 - Abstract This study focuses on a simulation strategy that will allow the performance characteristics of an isolated gas turbine engine component, resolved from a detailed, high-fidelity analysis, to be transferred to an engine system analysis carried out at a lower level of resolution. The technique described in this paper is called ‘de-coupled’ high-fidelity analysis and utilizes an object-oriented, zero-dimensional gas turbine modelling and performance simulation system and a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) component model. The technique involves the generation of a component characteristic map without the parallel or iterative execution of the non-dimensional cycle and the three-dimensional CFD model. Therefore, a faster high-fidelity engine performance simulation can be achieved at run time. This paper demonstrates the ‘de-coupled’ approach to component high-fidelity analysis by using a three-dimensional CFD intake model of a high by-pass ratio turbofan as a case study. The CFD model is based on the geometry of the intake of the CFM56-5B2 engine. The CFD-generated performance map can fully define the characteristics of the intake at several operating conditions and power settings, and is subsequently used to provide a more accurate, physics-based estimate of intake performance (i.e. pressure recovery) and hence, engine performance, replacing the default, empirical values within the non-dimensional cycle model. A detailed comparison between the baseline engine performance (empirical pressure recovery) and the engine performance obtained after using the CFD-generated map is presented in this paper. The analysis carried out by this study demonstrates relative changes in the simulated engine performance > 1 per cent.
