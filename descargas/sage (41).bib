abstract = {The question of whether [CH2OH]+ should be described as the hydroxymethyl cation, +CH2OH, or protonated formaldehyde, CH2=OH+, is reconsidered in the light of experimental information and new computational evidence. Previous arguments that the charge distribution in [CH2OH]+ may be probed by considering the incremental stabilisation of [CH2OH]+ induced by homologation on carbon (to give [CH3CHOH]+) or oxygen (to produce [CH2OCH3]+) are critically examined. Cation stabilisation energies are shown to be better indicators of the nature of these oxonium ions. Further insight into the structure of larger CnH2n+1O+ oxonium ions is obtained by considering the site of protonation of enol ethers and related species. Computational information, including AIM (Atoms and Molecules) and NBA (Natural Bond Analysis) charges on the carbon and oxygen atoms in [CH2OH]+ and related species, is considered critically. Particular attention is focused on the calculated bond lengths and barriers to rotation about the C–O bond(s) in [CH2OH]+, [CH3CHOH]+, [(CH3)2COH]+, CH3OH and [CH2OCH3]+ and the C–N bond in [CH2NH2]+. Trends in these data are consistent with appreciable π-bonding only in the C–O connections which correspond to the C=O bond in the parent aldehyde or ketone from which the oxonium ion may be considered to be derived by protonation or alkyl cationation.}

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used in a study of the air flow char acteristics in the occupied building zone. Correlation equations between the mean air speeds and the percentage dissatisfied with the macroscopic flow numbers were derived. Ten macroscopic flow numbers including the total ventilation rate, the air change rate, ventilation rate, air diffusion performance index, modified jet momentum number, two new flow numbers and three expressions of jet momentum ratio were investigated. A total number of 25 numerical experiments under isothermal flow conditions with four different geometrical arrangements (labelled A-D) were performed. The correlation equations derived from CFD were compared with those obtained from experi mental studies. It is found that the jet momentum ratio RM2 gives the equation with the best correlation coefficient and so is recommended for ventilation design.}

abstract = {Despite the centrality of data analysis to the discipline, sociology departments are currently falling short of teaching both undergraduate and graduate students crucial computing and statistical software skills. We argue that sociology instructors must intentionally and explicitly teach computing skills alongside statistical concepts to prepare their students for participation in a data-driven world. We illuminate foundational concepts for computing in the social sciences and provide easy-to-integrate recommendations for building competency with these concepts in the form of a workshop designed to introduce sociology undergraduate and graduate students to the logic of statistical software. We use our workshop to show that students appreciate and gain confidence from being taught how to think about computing.}

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics has become an important tool for studying blood flow dynamics. As an in-silico collection of methods, computational fluid dynamics is noninvasive and provides numerical values for the most important parameters of blood flow, such as velocity and pressure that are crucial in hemodynamic studies. In this primer, we briefly explain the basic theory and workflow of the two most commonly applied computational fluid dynamics techniques used in the congenital heart disease literature: the finite element method and the finite volume method. We define important terminology and include specific examples of how using these methods can answer important clinical questions in congenital cardiac surgery planning and perioperative patient management.}

abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate hemodynamic changes during aneurysmal dilatation in chronic type B aortic dissections compared to hemodynamic parameters in the healthy aorta with the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Methods: True lumen (TL)/false lumen (FL) dimensional changes, changes in total pressure (TP), and wall shear stress (WSS) were evaluated at follow-up (FU) compared to initial examination (IE) with transient CFD simulation with geometries derived from clinical image data and inflow boundary conditions from magnetic resonance images. The TL/FL pressure gradient between ascending and descending aorta (DAo) and maximum WSS at the site of largest dilatation was compared to values for the healthy aorta. Results: Hemodynamic changes at site of largest FL dilatation included 77% WSS reduction and 69% TP reduction. Compared to the healthy aorta, pressure gradient between ascending and DAo was a factor of 1.4 higher in the TL and a factor of 1.5 in the FL and increased at FU (1.6 and 1.7, respectively). Maximum WSS at the site of largest dilatation was a factor of 3 lower than that for the healthy aorta at IE and decreased by more than a factor of 2 at FU. Conclusions: The FL dilatation at FU favorably reduced TP. In contrast, unfavorable increase in pressure gradient between ascending and DAo was observed with higher values than in the healthy aorta. Maximum WSS was reduced at the site of largest dilation compared to healthy aorta.}

abstract = {Predictive toxicology plays a critical role in reducing the failure rate of new drugs in pharmaceutical research and development. Despite recent gains in our understanding of drug-induced toxicity, however, it is urgent that the utility and limitations of our current predictive tools be determined in order to identify gaps in our understanding of mechanistic and chemical toxicology. Using recently published computational regression analyses of in vitro and in vivo toxicology data, it will be demonstrated that significant gaps remain in early safety screening paradigms. More strategic analyses of these data sets will allow for a better understanding of their domain of applicability and help identify those compounds that cause significant in vivo toxicity but which are currently mis-predicted by in silico and in vitro models. These ‘outliers’ and falsely predicted compounds are metaphorical lighthouses that shine light on existing toxicological knowledge gaps, and it is essential that these compounds are investigated if attrition is to be reduced significantly in the future. As such, the modern computational toxicologist is more productively engaged in understanding these gaps and driving investigative toxicology towards addressing them.}

abstract = {Ever-rising fuel costs necessitate design of fuel-efficient vehicles. Consequently, modern vehicle manufacturers are focused on designing low aerodynamic drag vehicles which would in-turn reduce the fuel consumption. This study analyses the contribution of external rear-view mirrors to the total drag force and the overall sound pressure level at the A, B and C pillars, while optimising the external rear-view mirror design accordingly. Solid Works renditions of external rear-view mirror models mounted on a reference luxury sedan were analysed using a commercially available computational fluid dynamic package ANSYS FLUENT. A different approach was followed to carry out the empirical flow visualisation and predict sound pressure levels. The aerodynamic characterisation of the vehicle was done utilising the widely used shear stress transport turbulence model, while the analysis of wind noise and the contributing vortices employed a large eddy simulation. This approach significantly reduced computational time without compromising on accuracy.}
