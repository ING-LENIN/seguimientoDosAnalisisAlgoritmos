N2 - The fabric air dispersion system (FADS) is a ventilation terminal made of special polymer fabric. The porous structure of the fabric causes complex flow motion. Due to its advantages over the conventional ventilation system, i.e. ducts and diffusers, the FADS has been widely favoured by architects and researchers. In computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation the FADS is usually simplified into a free opening with an area equal to all pores and perforations, called the free area (FA) method in this present work. However, the effectiveness of this simplified method has not been validated. The present work took a half cylindrical FADS without orifices as an example and employed the FA method to simulate the airflow properties inside a chamber under isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. The simulated distributions of air velocity and temperature were compared with those by the direct description (DD) method. Meanwhile, the uniformity of air velocity distribution close to the FADS was validated against test data and the flow visualization using the dry ice as a smoking material. Results demonstrate that the FA method is effective and easy to implement, and performs as well as the DD method in predicting the distribution of airflow generated by the FADS without orifices.

N2 - Two plume formulae commonly used in fire safety engineering design were assessed by simulating the aerodynamics induced by a fire. The self-developed fire field model CY-TEAM, based on a modified two-equation k-" turbulence model, was used to predict the air flow and temperature field. Twelve simulations of varying heat release rate and perimeter of fire, with bounded and unbounded ceiling, were carried out. It is found that the power law for the mass flux with height holds. At the plume region, the two equations for mass flux would give the same result for those fires with heat release rate related to its perimeter. Results were compared with experimental data and with another set of simulations with finer grids. Further, part of the results are compared with those predicted by the new fire field model FDS based on large eddy simulation developed at Building and Fire Research Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA. Good agreement among k-" turbulence model, large eddy simulation model and experimental data were found. A further verification on CY-TEAM in studying plume induced by heptane pool fires was reported.

N2 - The mechanisms involved in the abnormal grain growth of the iron based oxide dispersion strengthened alloys are analysed in the present work. Its microstructural evolution takes place at high temperatures (0.9Tm) and is characterised by an initial submicrometre size microstructure and a strong < 110>|| rolling direction (RD) texture that evolves into a few extremely coarse grains (mm sizes) with < 112>||RD orientation. The analysis of the observed grain boundaries has been completed by molecular dynamics simulations. Microstructure evolution consists of an extended recovery process, followed by an abnormal grain growth stage, consequence of the orientation pinning mechanism and the proximity to a symmetric tilt boundary family between the < 110>||RD and < 112>||RD grains.

N2 - Abstract Unsaturated flow of liquid in a bed of uniform and spherical ore particles is studied numerically and experimentally. An unsteady and two-dimensional model is developed on the basis of the mass conservation equations of liquid phase in the bed and in the particles. The model equations are solved using a fully implicit finite difference method giving the distribution of the degree of saturation in the particles and in the bed and the vertical velocity of flow in the bed, as well as the effect of periodic infiltration on the above distributions. To calibrate the computational model, several column tests are performed using periodic infiltration of water on 40 cm high columns composed of ore having particles smaller than 25 mm. The numerical analysis shows that the results obtained from numerical modelling under the same operating conditions as used for column tests are in good agreement with those from experimental procedure, the degree of saturation of the bed and the time required to reach steady state conditions depend on the inflow of water and intrinsic permeability of the bed and the velocity fluctuations and the fluctuations of the degree of saturation in the bed depend on the inflow of water, period of infiltration, height and intrinsic permeability of the bed.

N2 - α-Amylase is one of the important enzymes in the starch-processing industry. However, starch processing requires high temperature, thus resulting in high cost. The high adsorptivity of α-amylase to the substrate allows this enzyme to digest the starch at a lower temperature. α-Amylase from Saccharomycopsis fibuligera R64 (Sfamy R64), a locally sourced enzyme from Indonesia, has a high amylolytic activity but low starch adsorptivity. The objective of this study was to design a computational model of Sfamy R64 with increased starch adsorptivity using bioinformatics method. The model structure of Sfamy R64 was compared with the positive control, ie, Aspergillus niger α-amylase. The structural comparison showed that Sfamy R64 lacks the surface-binding site (SBS). An SBS was introduced to the structure of Sfamy R64 by S383Y/S386W mutations. The dynamics and binding affinity of the SBS of mutant to the substrate were also improved and comparable with that of the positive control.

N2 - As a method for bonding powdered materials, sintering has distinct advantages, such as the production of a near final-shape of the desired product, without the need for significant post-processing. However, sintering has certain deficiencies, such as incomplete or weak bonding. Research is ongoing to improve the process. One approach to improve sintering processes of powdered materials is via electrically enhanced bonding, whereby electricity is pumped through the material, while it is compressed in a press, in order to induce Joule-heating. This paper develops a computationally based model for the direct simulation of electrically enhanced sintering of powdered materials using particle-based methods. The overall approach is to construct three coupled sub-models which primarily involve: (a) particle-to-particle mechanical contact, (b) particle-to-particle thermal exchange and (c) particle-to-particle electrical current flow. These physical processes are strongly coupled, since the dynamics dictates which particles are in contact and the contacts determine the electrical flow. The flow of electricity controls the Joule-heating and the induced thermal fields, which soften the material, leading to enhanced particle binding. The strong multiphysics-coupled sub-models are solved iteratively within each time-step using a recursive staggering scheme, which employs temporal adaptivity to control the error. If the process does not converge (to within an error tolerance) within a preset number of iterations, the time-step is adapted (reduced) by utilizing an estimate of the spectral radius of the coupled system. The modular approach allows for easy replacement of submodels, if needed. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the model and numerical solution scheme.
