abstract = {The idea of rearranging generation assets amongst firms to improve competition has once again surfaced in a recent report on improvements to the New Zealand Electricity Market. We present counterexamples to show that rearranging assets, either with asset divestiture to a new firm, or asset swaps between existing firms, may actually reduce competition in electricity markets. Our examples emphasize features that are particular to electricity, such as seasonality and transmission constraints. These results warn that applying economic rules of thumb to electricity markets may lead to erroneous conclusions.}

abstract = {Abstract This paper studies the effects of reducing the index of the original ADAMS (automatic dynamic analysis of mechanical systems) formulation. For this, a pilot computer program MECH-SIM (MECHanical SIMulations) was developed on the basis of the original ADAMS attributes such as sparse tableau formulation (STF) and backward difference formula (BDF) [1]. The STF implemented in the original ADAMS computer program uses differential and algebraic equations (DAE). In the new formulation it eliminates the three relations connecting the body angular velocities and the angular momentum. It also reformulates the implicit force equations by substituting their functions directly into the corresponding differential equations of motion. The above reduction maintains a reasonable number of equations when the geometric constraints stabilize the velocity and/or the acceleration constraints. A method is found to measure ‘the drift’ allowed by the velocity or acceleration constraints. This permits the use of constraints stabilization only ‘when needed’. Consequently, the BDF error control improves maintenance of the efficiency of the method. The pilot computer program MECH-SIM incorporates these improvements. The program was used to test the numerical accuracy and efficiency on mechanical systems used in agricultural mechanization, industrial equipment and auto suspensions. Hence, such results can be extended to the modern ADAMS computer program.}

abstract = {In conversations about pedagogy, researchers often overlook how physical space and movement shape teacher sensemaking. This article offers a comparative case study of classroom videos using a dynamic visual method to map embodied interaction called “interaction geography.” Our analysis proposes an integrative framework to study classroom interactions and teacher movement over space and time comprised of four salient characteristics within lessons: trails, landmarks, material routines, and circulation patterns. We discuss how this visual method and framework can be used and expanded by classroom researchers and teachers as a starting point to better understand teaching as a situative and spatial practice, a crucial step in characterizing responsive forms of instruction. This work has implications not only for teachers and teacher educators but also for architects, administrators, and researchers concerned with the physical design of classrooms.}

abstract = {Recognizing individual needs and customer preferences is key to succeeding and increasing competitiveness in both the commercial and public sectors. In the public sector, this is one of the ways to increase the efficiency of public funds allocated to public libraries. However, in order to make the right decisions, library management needs quality information about preferences and consumer behaviour, even from customers who cannot be the subject of routine research due to their young age. Therefore, this article proposes a new methodology for surveying children in order to design library services. The proposed methodology, which integrates principles from ethnographic and sociological methods, aims to overcome the problems of conventional sociological methods, such as how to conceive a child as a respondent and how to determine their preferences from hypothetical situations. This article uses a specially designed questionnaire tool to identify preferences, behaviour and information from children (as visitors of a library). The authors learned that Czech children went to the library primarily for books and games. In addition, the data from the questionnaire revealed patterns in the children’s and adults’ behaviour when visiting the library. All of the data in this article can be used for further research into consumer behaviour.}

abstract = {This paper reviews the contemporary discussion on the epistemological and ontological effects of Big Data within social science, observing an increased focus on relationality and complexity, and a tendency to naturalize social phenomena. The epistemic limits of this emerging computational paradigm are outlined through a comparison with the discussions in the early days of digitalization, when digital technology was primarily seen through the lens of dematerialization, and as part of the larger processes of “postmodernity”. Since then, the online landscape has become increasingly centralized, and the “liquidity” of dematerialized technology has come to empower online platforms in shaping the conditions for human behavior. This contrast between the contemporary epistemological currents and the previous philosophical discussions brings to the fore contradictions within the study of digital social life: While qualitative change has become increasingly dominant, the focus has gone towards quantitative methods; while the platforms have become empowered to shape social behavior, the focus has gone from social context to naturalizing social patterns; while meaning is increasingly contested and fragmented, the role of hermeneutics has diminished; while platforms have become power hubs pursuing their interests through sophisticated data manipulation, the data they provide is increasingly trusted to hold the keys to understanding social life. These contradictions, we argue, are partially the result of a lack of philosophical discussion on the nature of social reality in the digital era; only from a firm metatheoretical perspective can we avoid forgetting the reality of the system under study as we are affected by the powerful social life of Big Data.}

abstract = {The ball mill is usually the largest energy consumer at a mine site and significantly affects operational expenditures. Given a target particle size, Bond Mill Work Index estimates are used to predict a ball mill’s throughput. In order to maximize ball mill throughput and optimize energy utilization, it is important to get these estimates right. At the Tropicana Gold Mine, Work Index estimates, derived from X-Ray Fluorescence and Hyperspectral scanning of Grade Control samples, are used to construct spatial GeoMetallurgical models (GeoMet). Inaccuracies in block estimates exist due to limited calibration between grade control derived and laboratory Work Index values. To improve the calibration, an updating algorithm has been tested at the Tropicana Gold Mine. The aim of the study was to demonstrate a new process for updating block estimates using actual mill performance data. Deviations between predicted and actual mill performance are monitored and used to locally improve the Work Index estimates in the GeoMet model. The updating algorithm improves the spatial Work Index estimates, resulting in a real-time reconciliation of already extracted blocks and a recalibration of future scheduled blocks. The case study shows that historic and future production estimates improve on average by about 72 and 26%.}
