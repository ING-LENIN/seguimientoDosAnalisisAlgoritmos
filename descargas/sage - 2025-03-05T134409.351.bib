abstract = {The carbon nanotubes/nanofibers reinforced composites (CNRC) show great mechanical properties. There are several methods to simulate the mechanical properties of composites. Among the modeling techniques, embedded region (ER) shows the possibility for direct multi-scale simulation. A comparative study among beam element embedded model, solid element embedded model, as well as common solid element model is carried out. Programs developed in Matlab are utilized to generate geometric configurations, and finite element models are obtained from MSC.Patran with a script written in the Patran command language (PCL). Besides, a set of parametric studies are performed to investigate the influence of the aspect ratios of nanofibers and load cases on the mechanical properties of CNRC. The result shows that the ER technique is reliable to represent composites though neglecting the localized stress concentration, and beam element embedded models are trustworthy only for nanofibers with a large aspect ratio.}

abstract = {This survey assessed state policymakers’ efforts to promote teaching for understanding and thinking in elementary schools. Data were provided by two rounds of interviews of curriculum specialists in state departments of education nationwide and a review of curriculum-related documents cited during the interviews. Results indicate that state guidelines promoting teaching for understanding and thinking are typically communicated through inservice programs, goals and objectives statements, and/or guidelines for local curriculum planners. These initiatives rarely include statewide tests. The report summarizes similarities and differences in policy initiatives across all 50 states, with closer attention to seven states that are especially active in promoting curriculum reforms (e.g., California). The report also discusses implications for state-level policymakers and others who are eager to reshape the elementary school curriculum.}

abstract = {With the approval of aducanumab on the “Accelerated Approval Pathway” and the recognition of amyloid load as a surrogate marker, new successful therapeutic approaches will be driven by combination therapy as was the case in oncology after the launch of immune checkpoint inhibitors. However, the sheer number of therapeutic combinations substantially complicates the search for optimal combinations. Data-driven approaches based on large databases or electronic health records can identify optimal combinations and often using artificial intelligence or machine learning to crunch through many possible combinations but are limited to the pharmacology of existing marketed drugs and are highly dependent upon the quality of the training sets. Knowledge-driven in silico modeling approaches use multi-scale biophysically realistic models of neuroanatomy, physiology, and pathology and can be personalized with individual patient comedications, disease state, and genotypes to create ‘virtual twin patients’. Such models simulate effects on action potential dynamics of anatomically informed neuronal circuits driving functional clinical readouts. Informed by data-driven approaches this knowledge-driven modeling could systematically and quantitatively simulate all possible target combinations for a maximal synergistic effect on a clinically relevant functional outcome. This approach seamlessly integrates pharmacokinetic modeling of different therapeutic modalities. A crucial requirement to constrain the parameters is the access to preferably anonymized individual patient data from completed clinical trials with various selective compounds. We believe that the combination of data- and knowledge driven modeling could be a game changer to find a cure for this devastating disease that affects the most complex organ of the universe.}

abstract = {Over the past three years, the dams of Chelan County, Washington, its watershed and fish, the electrical grid and the laborers who maintain it, and cleared land with warehouses filled with computers, have all been enrolled as part of the decentralized digital infrastructure of Bitcoin. While popular accounts of the Bitcoin network correctly report the massive scale of energy it consumes and its potential environmental ramifications, in practice, the material geographies of Bitcoin are highly uneven and intertwined with specific infrastructural, ecological, and economic systems. In this article, we examine Bitcoin’s impacts on Chelan County, untangling the processes that occur as the distributed, digital infrastructure consumes the very real material resources of one place to produce digital goods used in another. In so doing, we examine not only the material costs of networks like Bitcoin, but also their historical ties to older processes of accumulation.}

abstract = {Abstract A proposed modification of the test section in the Boeing/AFOSR Mach 6 Quiet Tunnel is evaluated using CFD. The new design incorporates a section of increased diameter with the intention of enabling the tunnel to start in the presence of larger blunt models. Cone models with fixed base diameter (and hence fixed blockage ratio) are selected for this study. Cone half-angles from 15° to 75° are examined to ascertain the effect of the strength of the test model shock wave on the tunnel startup. The unsteady, laminar, compressible Navier—Stokes equations are solved. The resulting flowfields are examined to see what affect the shocks and shear layers would have on the quiet test section flow. This study indicates that cone angles ≤20° allow the tunnel to start.}

abstract = {Background: Mobile devices have been impacting on human standard of living by providing timely and accurate information anywhere and anytime through wireless media in developing nations. Shortage of experts in medical fields is very obvious throughout the whole world but more pronounced in developing nations. Objective: Thus, this study proposes a telemedicine platform for the vulnerable areas of developing nations. The vulnerable area are the interior with little or no medical facilities, hence the dwellers are very susceptible to sicknesses and diseases. Methods: The framework uses mobile devices that can run LightWeight Agents (LWAs) to send consultation requests to a remote medical expert in urban city from the vulnerable interiors. The feedback is conveyed to the requester through the same medium. The system architecture which contained AgenRoller, LWAs, The front-end (mobile devices) and back-end (the medical server) is presented. The algorithm for the software component of the architecture (AgenRoller) is also presented. The system is modeled as M/M/1/c queuing system, and simulated using Simevents from MATLAB Simulink environment. Result: The simulation result presented show the average queue length, the number of entities in the queue and the number of entities departure from the system. These together present the rate of information processing in the system. Conclusion: A full scale development of this system with proper implementation will help extend the few medical facilities available in the urban cities in developing nations to the interiors thereby reducing the number of casualties in the vulnerable areas of the developing world especially in Sub Saharan Africa.}

abstract = {Activated carbon was prepared from the seeds of aguaje palm (Mauritia flexuosa L.f.) by a chemical activation with phosphoric acid. This activated carbon was used for adsorbing metal ions: Pb(II), Cd(II), and Cr(III). To understand the mechanism of adsorption of these heavy metals (Cr, Cd, and Pb), the activated carbon surface was oxidized with nitric acid (1 M) increasing the oxygenated surface groups showing an increasing in their adsorption capacities of these metals. The oxidized activated carbon slightly increased the maximum adsorption capacity to 5–7%. The order of adsorption for unoxidized and oxidized activated carbons was Pb> Cd> Cr. This experimental information was corroborated by molecular modeling program Hyperchem 8 based adsorption mainly on two factors: the electron density and orbitals—highest occupied molecular orbital and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital.Activated carbons were characterized by adsorption/desorption of N2, obtaining an increase of microporous surface area for oxidized activated carbon. An increase of surface acidity and a reduction of isoelectric points were observed in oxidized activated carbon. According to these results, the adsorption of metal ions is favored in contact with an oxidized activated carbon, which has more amount of phenolic and carboxylic functional groups. Similarly, decreasing the isoelectric point indicates that the surface has a higher negative charge. The surface information was corroborated by Hyperchem, which indicates that the surface of the oxidized activated carbon has a higher electron density, indicating a larger amount of electrons on its surface, which means the surface of oxidized activated carbon charges negatively and thereby attracts metal ions.}
