abstract = {This exploratory study attempts to determine problem solving steps in block based programming environments. The study was carried out throughout one term within Code.org. Participants were 15 6th grade secondary school students enrolled in an IT course at a public secondary school. Observations, screenshots and interviews were analyzed together to find out what students do and what they think during problem solving process. As a result, three main steps (focus, fight and finalize) were extracted from students’ behavioral patterns. The results suggest that three steps occur in linear or cyclic manner with regard to the programming constructs required for the solution of the problem. Implications for instructors who desire to provide a better learning experience on problem solving through block-based programming are also included.}

abstract = {Owing to the limited installation space and duct size, coupled fittings are common in the duct systems of buildings. The coupling effect leads to changes in drag and fan energy consumption. This study investigates duct drag and flow field characteristics under coupling conditions. Experiments and numerical simulations with the Reynolds stress model are conducted. Flow field changes, flow field deformation, and drag changes in the duct are analyzed. Regardless of the coupling form, the velocity near the inner arc is fast, whereas that near the outer arc is slow. Under three different coupling connection conditions (S-shaped, L-shaped, and U-shaped), the outlet velocity gradient of the U-shaped coupling connection is the least obvious. After the fluid flows through the bend, a significant centerline velocity reduction can be observed, even greater than that in the bend. The lowest centerline velocity lies within the range of 2.5 D to 4.5 D after the bend. Coupling connection has an insignificant effect on upstream duct resistance. The resistance of single bend is less than that of the downstream bend for the coupled bend and greater than that of the upstream bend under coupling conditions. Practical application: Coupling effect is common in practical application of ventilation engineering. This effect leads to the change of fluid resistance loss of ducts and pipes. However, few researchers focus on this effect. This study finds that regardless of the coupling form, the velocity near the inner arc is fast, whereas that near the outer arc is slow. It means the guide vane should be set near inner arc. L-shaped coupling connection has the largest downstream piping resistance. The resistance of the downstream piping under S-shaped coupling is the least, thus L-shaped coupling connection should be avoided as far as possible in practical application.}

abstract = {In the context of recent debates about the ‘data deluge’ and the future of empirical sociology, this article turns attention to current activities aimed at achieving far-reaching transformations to the World Wide Web. The emergent ‘Semantic Web’ has received little attention in sociology, despite its potentially profound consequences for data. In response to more general recent calls for a critical politics of data we focus our enquiry as follows: first, we explore how sociological analysis of the artefacts and tools that are currently being developed to build a Semantic Web helps us to uncover the potential effects of this ‘next generation’ web on knowledge, data and expertise; and second we consider what a Semantic Web might offer to sociological research. We conclude by considering some implications of multidisciplinary engagement with the Web for the future of sociology.}

abstract = {Presenting oneself visually is an essential part of online behaviors on social networking sites (SNSs), and this is also the case for organizational accounts. Examining organizational self-presentation on their SNS accounts can show the key instruments through which organizations communicate online with the public. Thus, taking startups’ Instagram accounts as examples, this study aims to explore what and how organizations present visually on the photos uploaded to their Instagram accounts. The photos were analyzed in terms of their content, texts in photos, and facial and pixel-level characteristics. Photos and accounts were clustered respectively and resulting clusters were compared as well. The results suggest that text and people are the major objects represented in startups’ Instagram photos. The text presented in the photos was mainly about startups’ efforts to realize social values that can benefit communities by aiding people to do something in a timely manner. Two photo clusters were found: one mainly represented people and people-related words and the other mainly presented texts. Two account clusters were also found: one mainly consists of IT companies that presented texts in their photos and the other mainly consists of human-related services that presented people in their photos. This study can contribute to the body of literature by identifying the visual characteristics of organizational SNS photos and expanding self-presentation research to organizational SNS accounts.}

abstract = {Development of a tear in the abdominal wall allowing for protrusion of intra-abdominal contents is known as a hernia. This can cause pain, discomfort, and may need surgical repair. Hernias can affect people of any age or demographic. In the USA, over 1 million hernia repair procedures are performed each year. During these surgeries, it is common for a mesh to be utilized to strengthen the repair. Different techniques allow for the mesh to be placed in different anatomical planes depending on hernia location and approach. The locations are onlay, inlay, and sublay, with sublay being split into retromuscular or preperitoneal with sublay being the most commonly used. The use of an electrically active hernia repair mesh is of interest to model as electrical stimulation has been shown to improve soft tissue healing which could reduce recurrence rates. Theoretical 3D COMSOL models were built to evaluate the varying electric fields of an electrically active hernia repair mesh at each of the different anatomical planes. Three voltages were chosen (10, 20, and 30 mV) for the study to simulate a low-level electrical signal and the electric field from a piezoelectric material at the tissue layers surrounding the mesh construct. Based on the model outputs, the optimal mesh placement location was the sublay-retromuscular as this location had the highest electric field values in the connective tissues and rectus abdominis muscle, which are the primary tissues of concern for the healing process and a successful repair.}

abstract = {Coalescent-based Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inference generates estimates of evolutionary parameters and their posterior probability distributions. As the number of sequences increases, the length of time taken to complete an MCMC analysis increases as well. Here, we investigate an approach to distribute the MCMC analysis across a cluster of computers. To do this, we use bootstrapped topologies as fixed genealogies, perform a single MCMC analysis on each genealogy without topological rearrangements, and pool the results across all MCMC analyses. We show, through simulations, that although the standard MCMC performs better than the bootstrap-MCMC at estimating the effective population size (scaled by mutation rate), the bootstrap-MCMC returns better estimates of growth rates. Additionally, we find that our bootstrap-MCMC analyses are, on average, 37 times faster for equivalent effective sample sizes.}

abstract = {Developing adults’ reflective thinking habits is an aim of adult education, but the best way to do it has been overlooked. Common strategies communicate the skills and knowledge needed to reflect while providing practice opportunities. Yet research indicates that reflective habits are comprised of not only skills and knowledge but also of attitudes toward reflection. This study investigated whether attitudinal change strategies in a reflective thinking workshop induced cognitive dissonance by helping adults appreciate reflection and calibrate their reflective behavior. Participants were randomly assigned to a skills-based or skills-based plus attitudinal change workshop. Pre-post measures of learners’ need for and engagement in reflection were taken. Multivariate analysis of covariance revealed that attitudinal change strategies induced dissonance by increasing the need for reflection while decreasing perceived engagement in reflection. Exclusively skills-based strategies failed to affect the need for reflection but increased perceived engagement in reflection, creating overconfidence. Implications for research and practice are offered.}
