abstract = {The analysis of fluid flow near the wellbore region of a hydrocarbon reservoir is a complex phenomenon. The pressure drop and flow rates change in the near wellbore with time, and the understanding of this system is important. Besides existing theoretical and experimental approaches, computational fluid dynamics studies can help understanding the nature of fluid flow from a reservoir into the wellbore. In this research, a near wellbore model using three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations is presented for analyzing the flow around the wellbore. Pressure and velocity are coupled into a single system which is solved by an algebraic multigrid method for the optimal computational cost. The computational fluid dynamics model is verified against the analytical solution of the Darcy model for reservoir flow, as well as against the analytical solution of pressure diffusivity equation. The streamlines indicate that the flow is radially symmetric with respect to the vertical plane as expected. The present computational fluid dynamics investigation observes that the motion of reservoir fluid becomes nonlinear at the region of near wellbore. Moreover, this nonlinear behavior has an influence on the hydrocarbon recovery. The flow performance through wellbore is analyzed using the inflow performance relations curve for the steady-state and time-dependent solution. Finally, the investigation suggests that the Navier–Stokes equations along with a near-optimal solver provide an efficient computational fluid dynamics framework for analyzing fluid flow in a wellbore and its surrounding region.}

abstract = {The co-optimization of in-cylinder combustion and after-treatment technology has become a major aspect in engine design and development, with the goal of meeting the increasingly restrictive emission regulations in the transportation industry. Selective Catalytic Reduction is a robust technology to control the emission of NOx, and the injection of urea in water solution is the exhaust tailpipe is a key aspect of its operation. The proposed work uses high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics to characterize the atomization dynamics of the liquid jet in relevant cross-flow conditions. The study focuses on a commercial low-pressure (9 bar) pressure-swirl injector which is characterized in its internal geometry through high-resolution X-ray micro-computational tomography. The internal two-phase flow has been modeled according to the volume-of-fluid approach in a large eddy simulation framework and validated against near-nozzle X-ray radiography measurement. Moreover, characterizing the breakup dynamics for the swirling hollow cone formation, and assessing the influence of the cross-flow in the breakup dynamics was completed. The results have been reported proposing Re-Oh maps and probability density functions of the spray kinematics. Higher cross-flow momentum generates an increase in the jet intact length and a reduction of the liquid droplet diameters. The axial momentum of the jet is affected by the cross-flow already in the near-nozzle region, determining a relevant deviation of the spray velocities. This work aims to inform the initialization of Eulerian-Lagrangian spray models through the assignment of droplet kinematics and static one-way coupling between volume-of-fluid results and Lagrangian spray parcels, to be used for system-size domain simulations.}

abstract = {This paper presents a computational solution for the mobile robot self-localization problem using a new adaptive data fusion structure. Input sensors are employed for feeding the fusion structure, and consequently more precise perception from a highly noisy environment can be obtained. This adaptation process relies on two main steps; firstly, to choose the sensors and secondly, employing a model adaptation process. Using this process, the more incorrect data are eliminated, the more accurate localization results are obtained. Also, implementing more accurate sensor models, the values of error obtained in the final iterations will be less. By implanting the proposed process, simulation results indicate that the proposed structure is very useful and effective, especially when compared to the conventional techniques of localization problems solutions which rely mainly on the information theory.}

abstract = {Film cooling effectiveness has been studied by using a computational approach based on solving the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations. A wind tunnel test configuration is considered with a total of four cooling hole geometries as a cylindrical hole, a cylindrical hole with an upstream wedge (called ‘ramp’ thereafter), a shaped diffuser, and a double console slot. In all cases, the hole centreline has an inclination angle of 35° against the mainstream airflow and the blowing ratio is unity. Choosing the cylindrical model as a baseline, simulations have been carried out for grid convergence and turbulence model influence studies. Results are compared with available experimental data and other numerical predictions and good agreement has been achieved. Further computations continue with three remaining geometries, using the baseline flow conditions and configuration. Comparing to the results from the baseline model, it was found that the centreline adiabatic cooling effectiveness has shown incremental increases for the ‘ramp’ model, while results from the console slot model and the shape diffuser model have exhibited significant improvements by a factor of 1.5 and 2, respectively. The reason for such a step change in cooling effectiveness is mainly due to the weakening of the vortex structures in the vicinity of the hole exit, thus significantly reducing the entrainment of surrounding ‘hot’ fluids.}
