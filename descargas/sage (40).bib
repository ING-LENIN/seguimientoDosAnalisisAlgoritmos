abstract = {FEATURE AT A GLANCE: The earliest stage of the design process, known as conceptual design, is crucial to the overall effectiveness of the end product. Of particular importance is the search of the design space for ideas and concepts, which is restricted because of limitations in designers’ information-processing capabilities. One way to overcome this restriction is to implement computational intelligence to support and extend the search and exploration process. In this article, we report the outcome of a series of multidisciplinary workshops that identify seven key topics necessary for the future development of a generic user-centered computational environment to support conceptual design.}

abstract = {Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) operation for coronary artery disease with different types of grafts has a large clinical application world wide. Immediately after this operation patients are usually relieved of their chest pain and have improved cardiac function. However, after a while, these bypass grafts may fail due to for example, neointimal hyperplasia or thrombosis. One of the causes for this bypass graft failure is assumed to be the blood flow with low wall shear stress. The aim of this research is to estimate the wall shear stress in a graft and thus to locate areas were wall shear stress is low. This was done with the help of a blood flow computer model. Postoperative biplane angiograms of the graft were recorded, and from these the three-dimensional geometry of the graft was reconstructed and imported into the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) program FLUENT. The stationary diastolic flow through the grafts was calculated, and the wall shear stress distribution was estimated. This procedure was carried out for one native vessel and two different types of bypass grafts. One bypass graft was a saphenous vein and the other one was a varicose saphenous vein encased in a fine, flexible metal mesh. The mesh was attached to give the graft a defined diameter. The computational results show that each graft has distinct areas of low wall shear stress. The graft with the metal mesh has an area of low wall shear stress (< 1 Pa, stationary flow), which is four times smaller than the respective areas in the other graft and in the native vessel. This is thought to be caused by the smaller and more uniform diameter of the metal mesh-reinforced graft.}

abstract = {The design of metallic card clothing, which is one of the most important devices in the textile industry, has always been based on operational experience. With the development of types of fibers and the requirements for the quality of yarns, those principles concluded by engineers seem to be losing their efficiency. Recent research found that airflow played an important role in the card process, which means airflow should be carefully studied. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation greatly helps in the analysis of airflow because the gauge between carding elements is too narrow to put in any measuring device. In the present study, with the help of CFD simulation, the air around different carding clothing with varied tooth depth was analyzed. It was concluded that the carding efficiency improvement in card clothing with lower tooth depth may be related to more concentrated air velocity at the tooth tips. This resulted in more probabilities that fibers would get through the cylinder surface at the teeth tips, so that the fibers could be caught by flat-top needles more efficiently. With this assumption, a new generation of card clothing called “double teeth” containing two teeth in a single section has been invented. The new configuration design of card clothing was then applied in several spinning mills on an industrial scale for experiments. The results showed about a 30% improvement in production at the same quality level as conventional card clothing, which implied the usefulness of the newly applied principles related to airflow. Despite the difficulty in the study of the complex carding process, the new airflow analysis method has shown an optional and worthwhile way of thinking that could make a difference in future research in the textile industry.}

abstract = {Despite the centrality of data analysis to the discipline, sociology departments are currently falling short of teaching both undergraduate and graduate students crucial computing and statistical software skills. We argue that sociology instructors must intentionally and explicitly teach computing skills alongside statistical concepts to prepare their students for participation in a data-driven world. We illuminate foundational concepts for computing in the social sciences and provide easy-to-integrate recommendations for building competency with these concepts in the form of a workshop designed to introduce sociology undergraduate and graduate students to the logic of statistical software. We use our workshop to show that students appreciate and gain confidence from being taught how to think about computing.}
