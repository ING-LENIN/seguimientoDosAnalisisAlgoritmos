N2 - Purpose: We aim to better understand the curricular, staffing, and achievement trade-offs entailed by expansions of high-school computer science (CS) for students, schools, and school leaders. Methods: We use descriptive, correlational, and quasi-experimental methods to analyze statewide longitudinal course-, school-, and staff-level data from California, where CS course taking has expanded rapidly. Findings: We find that these rapid CS course expansions have not come at the expense of CS teachers’ observable qualifications (namely certification, education, or experience). Within-school course taking patterns over time suggest that CS enrollment growth has come at the expense of social studies, English/language arts (ELA), and arts courses, as well as from other miscellaneous electives. However, we find no evidence that increased enrollment of students in CS courses at a school has a significant effect on students’ math or ELA test scores. Implications: Flexible authorization requirements for CS teachers appear to have allowed school leaders to staff new CS courses with teachers whose observable qualifications are strong, though we do not observe teachers’ CS teaching skill. Increasing CS participation is unlikely to noticeably improve school-level student test scores, but administrators also do not need to be overly concerned that test scores will suffer. However, school leaders and policymakers should think carefully about what courses new CS courses will replace and whether such replacements are worthwhile.

N2 - In recent years, higher education institutions have been under increasing pressure to innovate in teaching, research, and learning methodologies. This longitudinal study adopts a participatory research approach, utilizing photovoice techniques, narrative methodologies, and focus groups to explore student perceptions of innovative pedagogies within a specialized Higher Education Institution (HEI). Spanning three academic semesters and involving 43 students from a variety of disciplines, the research integrates photographs and self-authored narratives as data sources. Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA), in conjunction with photovoice, facilitated a detailed data analysis, revealing four main clusters of pedagogies viewed as innovative by students: “Hero Pedagogies,” highlighting emotional engagement and storytelling; “Community and Solidarity Pedagogies,” emphasizing community involvement; “Sustainable Green Pedagogies,” focusing on sustainability; and “Technology Enhanced Pedagogies,” which utilize technology to improve learning experiences. Students expressed a strong preference for pedagogical strategies that promote emotional connections and incorporate storytelling, stressing the importance of human interaction in the learning process. They also valued approaches that foster community-centered learning, interdisciplinary methods, and experiential education for tackling broader societal and economic challenges. The role of technology in bridging theory with practical application was also underscored. These findings offer insights into effective pedagogical practices by highlighting student-supported approaches. Integrating these innovative pedagogical clusters can enhance the educational experience for institutions, communities, and learners alike, fostering active engagement in the learning journey.

N2 - A multicriteria decision-making model was proposed in order to acquire the optimum one among different product design schemes. VIKOR method was introduced to compute the ranking value of each scheme. A multiobjective optimization model for criteria weight was established. In this model, projection pursuit method was employed to identify a criteria weight set which could keep classification information of original schemes to the greatest extent, while PROMETHEE II was adopted to keep sorting information. Dominance based multiobjective simulated annealing algorithm (D-MOSA) was introduced to solve the optimization model. Finally, an example was taken to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of this model.

N2 - Interest in new empiricisms and transdisciplinary methods has led many social inquirers to engage with 20th-century post-classical physical science. Many of these projects have focused on alternative matter–mind mixtures and in/organic variation, concerned that past theories of sociality have dismissed the vibrancy and animacy of the nonhuman material world. This paper explores the power of speculative fiction to help us rethink empiricism in posthuman ecologies of the Anthropocene, in the midst of post-truth conditions and growing science denialism. We foreground speculative fiction as a way to open up scientific imaginaries, rethinking the relationship between nature, technics, and human “sense” making. We show how such texts offer alternative images of research methods for studying pluralist ecologies and new forms of worldly belonging.

N2 - Abstract In this paper a three-dimensional computational methodology for multistage turbomachinery flows is developed, validated and applied in analysing the reduced mass flowrate operation of a four-stage turbine. The flow is modelled by the three-dimensional Favre-Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations using the Launder-Sharma near-wall k-ɛ turbulence closure, which are integrated using an implicit third-order upwind solver. The computation models the eight blade rows, including the tip clearance gaps of the rotors, using a 6 × 106 points grid, and computes the time-averaged flow using mixing planes between rows. Computational results are compared with measurements for various operating points. After this validation the method is used in a first attempt to analyse the three-dimensional flow at reduced-mass-flow operation.

N2 - Based on Unconscious Thought Theory (UTT) and a series of experimental and correlational studies, Dijksterhuis and his colleagues conclude that when making complex choices/decisions, conscious thought—deliberation while attention is directed at the problem—leads to poorer choices/decisions than “unconscious thought”—deliberation in the absence of conscious attention directed at the problem. UTT comprises six principles said to apply to decision making, impression formation, attitude formation and change, problem solving, and creativity. Because the implications of UTT for psychological research and theory are considerable, the authors critically examined these six principles (and the studies used to support them) in light of the extant scholarship on unconscious processes, memory, attention, and social cognition. Our examination reveals that UTT is a theory of the unconscious that fails to take into account important work in cognitive psychology, particularly in the judgment and decision making area. Moreover, established literatures in social psychology that contradict fundamental tenets of UTT and its empirical basis are ignored. The authors conclude that theoretical and experimental deficiencies undermine the claims of the superiority of unconscious thinking as portrayed by UTT.

N2 - This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of using educational games for learning basic programing skills. For this, we designed the game “Aladdin and his flying carpet” with all pedagogical consideration in mind. We conducted the experiment with 107 sixth grade pupils with no prior knowledge of programing. The game was applied at the beginning of the course in a naturalistic classroom environment. The progress was monitored and evaluated with validated pre- and posttests. The knowledge gain was observed according to the set of learning objectives from the general curricula, and minimum knowledge standards were pursued within those. The result demonstrated that most of the pupils achieved all of the observed learning objectives. The biggest progress was observed with the “complete a program” objective. The least progress was observed with the tasks where “create a program” and “divide a problem” objectives were combined. Strong correlation was found between the final results of the posttest and the scores from playing the game, especially with the more challenging “divide a problem” learning objective. Finally, no significant difference was observed in the results between girls and boys.

N2 - Students with learning disabilities (LD) often receive instruction in general education science classrooms. However, little is known about the academic success of students with LD in this setting. As inquiry-based science instruction has become more prominent, research focusing on student learning is needed to explore how such instruction meets students’ needs. To address this, a cross-case analysis was conducted. It included six middle school students, each with LD, from a Midwestern city. Each student was enrolled in a general education science class that used inquiry-based instruction. Data sources included student and educator interviews, classroom observations, and student portfolios. Results indicated that most of the students with LD had difficulty acquiring science process knowledge and that students relied on peer supports to facilitate their learning. Findings extend the research on science instruction for students with LD in middle school classrooms using inquiry-based instruction.
