abstract = {Psychologists, teachers and researchers have a common interest in understanding how students solve mathematics problems. We want, and need, to understand how solutions to problems are developed so that interactions with both successful and unsuccessful problem-solvers can become more effective. In order to build a more sophisticated understanding of problem-solving we must consider a number of major factors — the instructional setting, the nature of the problem-solver, the resources available, the structure of the mathematical content and the student’s understanding of that, and the processes used in the solution. Also needed is a technique for identifying those processes in samples of students’ mathematics performance. What we learn from using the technique influences the design of future instruction.}

abstract = {The marriage of twenty-first-century horizons of technology and the global ideal constitutes techno-global rationality as it reflects contemporary impulses, frames and teleologies. Fast-paced automation, the importance of cosmopolitanism and the colonial legacy have come to dominate educational discourse and drive calls for streamlined educative practice. Although such efficiency models empower a transactional/linear mode of teaching and learning, they do little to privilege integrative voices, deliberation and intersubjective care found in global citizenship education (GCE) definitions. We argue such rationality has exacerbated a neo-colonial ethic that promulgates economic, political and cultural pressure to control and narrow otherwise diverse learning opportunities. Drawing from recent research into technology and GCE in two International Baccalaureate international schools, we note the importance of communicative outreach and agency in diversity. We also highlight the distorting effects of hyper-rationalised neo-colonial interpretations of global agency. This article will interest those seeking to develop global educational policy and practice along with revitalising interpretations of technology integration.}

abstract = {Intercorrelations among several measures reflecting quantitative thinking tasks were found for subsamples of pupils at each of the first five grade levels in elementary schools in a middle-class suburban community in the greater Los Angeles area. One set of subsamples participated in an experimental instructional program emphasizing use of tactile, manipulative, and individual activity methodology in learning metric and decimal concepts, whereas a second set of subsamples of comparable ability levels took part in a traditionally taught program that did not stress manipulative activities. The appearance of substantial interrelationships among measures in the subsamples of pupils in the experimental program at the second, third, combined fourth-fifth, and fifth grade but for children in comparison groups at only the second and fourth grade levels suggested the existence of a general factor of quantitative thinking and the presence of greater degree of transfer and generalization of problem-solving capabilities to a variety of mathematics tasks for members of the experimental program than for those in a traditional program. For pupils in the first three grades, a standardized measure of the Piagetian construct of conservation failed to show much promise as a concurrently valid indicator of success in a number of mathematically related achievement measures. Relative to performance on a nationally standardized test in mathematics emphasizing traditional objectives and competencies, higher concurrent validity coefficients tended to be obtained for subsamples in the experimental program than for subsamples not in the program.}

But robotic systems need true Soldier-Robot Teams where each part of the team understands the roles, responsibilities, and required actions of the others and has the capability to provide the communication necessary to make the team successful. Accomplishing this within a mission context, accepted military doctrine, and social norms of the society in which the human-robot teams operate, represents a major theoretical and technological challenge for research in human-robot teams.}

abstract = {Cross sections for the threshold collision-induced dissociation of Cu2+(H2O)n, where n = 8–10, are measured using a guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometer. The primary dissociation pathway is found to be loss of a single water molecule followed by the sequential loss of additional water molecules until n = 8, at which point charge separation to form CuOH+(H2O)4 + H+(H2O)3 is observed to occur at a slightly lower energy than loss of a water molecule. Competition from charge separation prohibits the formation of appreciable amounts of the n = 7 or smaller complexes as reactants in the source. These findings indicate that Cu2+ has a critical size of 8. Analysis of the data using statistical modeling techniques that account for energy distributions and lifetime effects yields primary and sequential bond dissociation energies (BDEs) for loss of one and two water molecules from n = 8–10 complexes as well as the barrier for charge separation from n = 8. More speculative analysis extends the thermochemistry obtained down to n = 5 and 6. Theoretical BDEs are determined from quantum chemical calculations using structures optimized at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level along with the lowest-energy isomers suggested by single point energies at the MP2(full), M06, B3LYP and B3P86 levels of theory using a 6-311+G(2d,2p) basis set. BDEs at 0 K are converted to 298 K thermodynamic values using a rigid rotor/harmonic oscillator approximation. Experimental and theoretical entropies of activation suggest that a third solvent shell forms at n = 9, in accord with previous findings. The present work represents the first experimentally determined hydration enthalpies for the Cu2+(H2O)n system.}

abstract = {Understanding differences in the genetic architecture of complex traits between the two sexes has significant implications for evolutionary studies and clinical diagnosis. However, our knowledge about sex-specific genetic architecture is limited largely because of a lack of analytical models that can detect and quantify the effects of sex on the complexity of quantitative genetic variation. Here, we derived a statistical model for mapping DNA sequence variants that contribute to sex-specific differences in allele frequencies, linkage disequilibria, and additive and dominance genetic effects due to haplotype diversity. This model allows a genome-wide search for functional haplotypes and the estimation and test of haplotype by sex interactions and sex-specific heritability. The model, validated by simulation studies, was used to detect sex-specific functional haplotypes that encode a pain sensitivity trait in humans. The model could have important implications for mapping complex trait genes and studying the detailed genetic architecture of sex-specific differences.}

abstract = {To predict and minimize machining distortion in the manufacturing process, bulk residual stresses in aeronautical components with distinct geometries were investigated via experimental mechanics and numerical simulation. The residual stress state was appropriately simplified according to geometric/processing feathers and deformation patterns of the investigated parts. In each case study, an optimal experimental method was selected to reconstruct the concerned stress tensor. Thereafter, qualitative comparison and validation were performed using cross-method verification and/or numerical simulation. Additionally, the spatial resolution and distribution characteristics of the residual stress were analyzed and discussed in detail. The results revealed that thermal and mechanical nonuniformity caused by material processing is the main source of bulk residual stress in the investigated components. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the contour method on the measurement of different geometric components was verified by numerical simulation. Combining the accurate measurement of the characteristic plane and the appropriate numerical simulation of the global stress field, an engineering-oriented approach for full-field stress evaluation was proposed. This research can provide valuable engineering guidance and suggestions for stress evaluation and distortion analysis prior to manufacturing of integral structures.}
