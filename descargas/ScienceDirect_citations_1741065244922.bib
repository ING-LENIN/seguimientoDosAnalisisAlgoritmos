It has been proven to help in healing the body, mind, and culture. Music can maintain and regulate emotion. It is a common thread among large social groups and is used as a tool to navigate through life. Real science and real music require a steady thinking process. It is a way of finding compatibility within a society as well as developing a link with other societies. Music plays a developmental role in a person’s identity, cultural worldview and permeates through life. In nutshell “Science explains Music and Music makes us The Human”}

abstract = {The approach of cross-language brain decoding is to use models of brain decoding from one language to decode stimuli of another language. It has the potential to provide new insights into how our brain represents multiple languages. While it is possible to decode semantic information across different languages from neuroimaging data, the approach’s overall success remains to be tested and depends on a number of factors such as cross-language similarity, age of acquisition/proficiency levels, and depth of language processing. We expect to see continued progress in this domain, from a traditional focus on words and concrete concepts toward the use of naturalistic experimental tasks involving higher-level language processing (e.g., discourse processing). The approach can also be applied to understand how cross-modal, cross-cultural, and other nonlinguistic factors may influence neural representations of different languages. This article provides an overview of cross-language brain decoding with suggestions for future research directions.}

We propose a research design that combines the Urban Design Computational Model (UDCM) and the Optimization Model of Energy Process (OMEP) to demonstrate how an urban design computation can be integrated with an energy performance process and system. An evidence-based case study of community-level near zero energy districts will be needed for future work.}

It involves encompassing perception, comprehension, and projection levels in human beings. Accurate evaluation of SA statuses across these three levels is crucial for mitigating human false-positive and false-negative rates in monitoring complex scenarios in the aviation context. This study proposes a comprehensive comparative analysis by involving two types of physiological records: electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and brain electrical activity mapping (BEAM) images. These two modalities are leveraged to automate precise SA evaluation using both conventional machine learning and advanced deep learning techniques. Benchmarking experiments reveal that the BEAM-based deep learning models attain state-of-the-art performance scores of 0.955 for both SA perception and comprehension levels, respectively. Conversely, the EEG signals-based manual feature extraction, selection, and classification approach achieved a superior accuracy of 0.929 for the projection level of SA. These findings collectively highlight the potential of deploying diverse physiological records as valuable computational tools for enhancing SA evaluation throughout aviation decision-making safety.}

Anecdotal evidence has indicated that psychedelic substances may acutely enhance creative task performance, although empirical support for this claim is mixed at best. Clinical research has shown that psychedelics might have enduring effects on mood and well-being. However, there is no neurocognitive framework that ties acute changes in cognition to long-term effects in mood. In this review, we operationalize creativity within an emerging cognitive control framework and assess the current empirical evidence of the effects of psychedelics on creativity. Next, we leverage insights about the mechanisms and computations by which other psychoactive drugs act to enhance versus impair cognition, in particular to those that act on catecholamines, the neurophysiological consequences of which are relatively well understood. Finally, we use the same framework to link the suggested psychedelic-induced improvements in creativity with enduring psychedelic-induced improvements in mood.}

Nowadays these principles, and the systems that accompany them, are widely applied across various sectors, including health services management systems. The question arises: To what extent are these principles appropriate for health care management applications? This chapter explores the question from a human-centered systems perspective by examining the rationalities and assumptions that underpin manufacturing systems and applying these ideas to health care contexts. Human-centered systems have a long theoretical tradition within the automation and control community stretching back at least into the 1970s. It is a particularly strong theme in manufacturing systems research. As automation and control systems are increasingly important outside the factory, many researchers are revisiting core concepts within this tradition. One particularly important sector is health care, which, in recent years, has implemented a range of AMAT (automation and machine-assisted thinking)-type solutions not the least of which are enterprise resource planning systems (ERPs). These implementations have been accompanied by highly publicized systems failures. Ethical problems have also arisen. The chapter exposes an ‘administrative evil’ that relegates the patient to the status of a subassembly, a component in an ever-more complex health care production line. Humans are dehumanized in the rationality of our health care administrative systems. The chapter concludes that health care systems projects should adopt a human-centered approach that draws on research in manufacturing, automation, and control engineering as well as other disciplines.}

Recent years have witnessed significant advances in spatially-explicit geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), which integrates spatial studies and AI, primarily focusing on incorporating spatial thinking and concept into deep learning models for urban studies. This paper provides an overview of techniques and applications of spatially-explicit GeoAI in Urban Geography based on 581 papers identified using a systematic review approach. We examined and screened papers in three scopes of Urban Geography (Urban Dynamics, Social Differentiation of Urban Areas, and Social Sensing) and found that although GeoAI is a trending topic in geography and the applications of deep neural network-based methods are proliferating, the development of spatially-explicit GeoAI models is still at their early phase. We identified three challenges of existing models and advised future research direction towards developing multi-scale explainable spatially-explicit GeoAI. This review paper acquaints beginners with the basics of GeoAI and state-of-the-art and serve as an inspiration to attract more research in exploring the potential of spatially-explicit GeoAI in studying the socio-economic dimension of the city and urban life.}

Several questions are addressed: (1) Under what conditions will a time-dependent solution converge to a steady-state supersonic flow, (2) Under what conditions will it converge to subsonic flow and (3) What conditions are necessary to insure a particular unique solution for subsonic flows. The results provide an orientation, or way of thinking, about the role of such conditions in time-dependent solutions of steady-state flows. The results also show that supersonic solutions are readily obtained by holding only pressure and temperature fixed at the duct inlet, and allowing velocity to float. However, subsonic solutions require pressure, temperature and velocity to be fixed at both the duct inlet and exit. If no conditions are held fixed at the exit, the results always converge to the supersonic solution, even if the fixed inlet mass flow is less than critical. In such a case, the program appears to generate additional mass flow between the inlet and throat, sufficient to choke the flow. These results also have some impact on two- and three-dimensional time-dependent solutions where subsonic flow is present on some or all portions of the flow boundaries.}

We argue that limiting our research to clinical patients at the extreme of the psychosis continuum would likely obscure our knowledge as to how a minority of the general population would develop psychosis. Research on putative neurobiological origins of inter-individual differences in personality traits may be useful in mapping the biomarkers of psychosis. To identify biomarkers applicable to the general population, we advocate the transdiagnostic and psychosis continuum approach. We also advocate the use of multivariate analyses and computational modelling to tackle complex multi-modal datasets. More research should be conducted to study intra-individual variations over different ranges of timescale.}

It is a concise field of study in psychology and neuroscience that focuses on various developmental aspects of the brain. Among all other factors, nutritional status is believed to play a very important role in cognitive development. The purpose of this work is to analyze the impacts of different nutritional status levels on the child’s cognitive development. This work designs a model that uses a neural network and differential equations. The neural network is applied on a dataset called “Child Birth Weight Dataset” available at IEEE Dataport ( http://dx.doi.org/10.21227/dvd4-3232) for finding the nutritional status of a child. The different levels of nutritional status, such as low-nutritional status, normal-nutritional status, and over-nutritional status are integrated with the formulated differential equations. The model is computationally simulated considering four different sets of parameter values that represent four different perspectives such as ‘only positive’, ‘only negative’, ‘mix and unequal weight’, and ‘mix and equal weight’ of the influencing factors. The experimental results show that normal-nutritional status is the best nutritional status for cognitive development. However, the best cognitive development happens when all other influencing factors like environmental effects, socioeconomic status, heredity, learning opportunities, and use of experiences are given equal importance. The results also depict that the low- and over-nutritional status cannot restrict cognitive development for a long time. After a certain period, the development gets triggered and it happens. It may be slow and not up to the mark of the development under normal-nutritional status, but it happens. Simply it can be said that nutritional status alone does not have control over the cognitive development of a child. Along with nutritional status, other influencing factors are important too.}

Specifically, 1) concept cognition for knowledge graphs is realized from the perspective of mining multi-granularity decision rule. 2) Decision tables corresponding to four granularities form a multi-granularity decision table group, and then the result from coarser granularity can guide and help obtaining the result from finer granularity. 3) We propose a framework for mining multi-granularity decision rules, which involves going from a multi-granularity decision table group to the frequent maximal attribute patterns to the decision rules to the credible decision rules. Finally, we verified effectiveness of dividing positive and negative data, monotonicity of attribute patterns in a multi-granularity decision table group, and downward monotonicity of credibility, and observed the impact of the parameter min_cov and min_conf on execution times.}

This chapter provides an overview of a situation-theoretic computational environment. Situation theory was first formulated in detail by Jon Barwise and John Perry in 1983. Various versions of the theory have been applied to a number of linguistic issues, resulting in what is commonly known as situation semantics. Individuals, properties, relations, spatio-temporal locations, and situations are the basic constructs of situation theory. The world is viewed as a collection of objects, sets of objects, properties, and relations. Infons are discrete items of information and situations are first-class objects that describe parts of the real world. Information flow is made possible by a network of abstract links among high-order uniformities, viz. situation types. The chapter presents a computational approach to situation theory and its associated environment (called BABY-SIT). The environment is dubbed BABY-SIT because it is believed that presently it includes far too many provisional, make-shift design decisions. The chapter highlights that compared to existing approaches, BABY-SIT enhances the basic features of situation theory.}

Additionally, CKD is associated with various dietary factors, including liver failure, diabetes, anemia, nerve damage, inflammation, peroxidation, obesity, and other related conditions. Therefore, early prediction of CKD is important to progress the functionality of the kidney. In recent times, IoT has been widely used in a diversity of healthcare sectors through the incorporation of monitoring devices such as digital sensors and medical devices for patient monitoring from remote places. To overcome the problem, this research proposed a conceptual architecture for CKD detection. The sensor layer of the architecture includes IoT devices to collect data and the proposed classifier, MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron), utilizes the Anova-F feature selection technique to effectively detect CKD (Chronic Kidney Disease). In addition to MLP, four other classifiers including ANN (Artificial Neural Network), Simple RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), and SVM (Support Vector Machine), are employed for comparative analysis of accuracy. Furthermore, three additional feature selection techniques, namely Chi-squared, SFFS (Sequential Floating Forward Selection), and SBFS (Sequential Backward Floating Selection), are utilized to evaluate their impact on the accuracy of CKD detection. Our proposed method outperforms all other approaches with a remarkable accuracy of 99 % while maintaining efficient computational time. This advancement is crucial in developing a highly accurate machine capable of predicting CKD in remote areas with ease.}

abstract = {In the context of granular computing, sequential three-way decision is a useful tool to triadic thinking, triadic computing and triadic processing from coarser to finer under multilevel and multiview granularity space. In this paper, we mainly explore a novel framework of sequential three-way decision for the fusion of mixed data from the subjective and objective dynamic perspectives. The former focuses on the decision maker’s dynamic behavior without considering the time-evolving data, and the latter emphasizes on dealing with dynamic mixed data over time by multi-stage decision-making. We firstly utilize four T-norm operators and kernel-based similarity relations to integrate different types of dynamic data. Then the subjective and objective models of sequential three-way decision are investigated based on decision thresholds, attribute importance and cost reduction. Finally, the comparative experiments are reported to verify that our proposed models can achieve the lower decision cost and the acceptable accuracy.}

Inspired by earlier studies, which investigated whether abstract-thinking ability are predictable by social networking sites data, we used supervised machine learning to predict verbal-reasoning ability based on a proposed set of features extracted from virtual community membership. A large sample (N = 3,646) of Russian young adults aged 18–22 years approved access to the data from their social networking accounts and completed an online test on verbal reasoning. We experimented with binary classification machine-learning models for verbal-reasoning prediction. Prediction performance was tested on isolated control subsamples for men and women. The results of prediction on AUC-ROC metrics for control subsamples over 0.7 indicated reasonably good performance on predicting verbal-reasoning level. We also investigated the contribution of virtual community's genres to verbal reasoning level prediction for male and female participants. Theoretical interpretations of results stemming from both Vygotsky's sociocultural theory and behavioural genomics are discussed, including the implication that virtual communities make up a non-shared environment that can cause variance in verbal reasoning. We intend to conduct studies to explore the implications of the results further.}

The implementation of such architectures are time-consuming and are generally not interoperable with other domains [3]. The presented research describes the experimentation of a Open Source, LMS enhanced with elements of AI aiming at supporting online teachers’ and tutors’ work by using a KB specific to relational and pedagogical aspects, not connected to a specific subject matter. Such implementation needs to be provided of an authoring tool easily and readily usable by tutors and teachers of different subjects and with medium level IT training. Starting point of our investigation has been a preliminary analysis of machine-mediated, human-human interactions (MM-HHI) and communications by using the Teachers’ thinking approach [4], [5], [6]. We considered messages exchanged between teachers/tutors and online students in three post-graduate, online courses running at the University of Macerata during 2008–2010 by the Faculty of Education. The study showed that about 30% of messages concerned structured information that could be straightforwardly retrieved by an artificial agent; almost all remaining messages were instead deeply bound to student’s learning path or required a significant input by the teacher/tutor, while the residual part of messages could — to some extents — be delegated to an intelligent agent having access to students’ tracking data in order to display visual information to users or trigger alarms to tutors. The investigation carried out prompted us for the deployment of an Open Source chat-bot system that would retrieve information already coded into the courses or originated by students through the analysis of their activity logs; the chat-bot agent uses this structured information in order to answer students’ most common questions hence relieving teachers and tutors from doing this repetitive task. The system is being implemented on a OLAT ver. 6.3 LMS loosely coupled to a JADE-based Multi Agent System in charge of processing user tracking data and running the ALICE chat-bot integrated with the platform messaging system.}

We specifically propose that children’s learning is analogous to a particular style of programming called hacking, making code better along many dimensions through an open-ended set of goals and activities. By contrast to existing theories, which depend primarily on local search and simple metrics, this view highlights the many features of good mental representations and the multiple complementary processes children use to create them.}

As known, the central issues for knowledge-based systems are what’s-in-a-node and what’s-in-a-link. As shown, the answer can be obtained from the functor-as-object representation. Then the nodes are functors, and the main links are natural transformations. Such a model is applicable to represent morphing, and the object is considered as a process, which is in a harmony with current ideas on computing. It is possible to represent information channels that carry out the transformations of processes. The possibility of generating displaced concepts and the generation of families of their morphs is shown, the evolvent of stages of knowledge and properties of the process serve as parameters.}

Secondly, a misclassification cost matrix is tailored to different driving needs. Finally, inspired by the complex neural networks found in the human brain, we develop a specialized lightweight neural network, termed the Width Human-like Neural Network (WNN), aimed at realizing personalized cognition and facilitating human-like decision-making in driving intention. Experimental studies and validation based on natural driving trajectory data from Kunming, China, demonstrate that the method accurately infers internal implicit driving intention from external explicit and observable driving behaviors, achieving a prediction accuracy of 99.8%. This framework strategically allocates limited computational resources to critical areas for autonomous vehicles and exemplifies best practices for improving neural network performance in driving intention analysis tasks.}

abstract = {I present several computational complexity results for propositional STRIPS planning, i.e., STRIPS planning restricted to ground formulas. Different planning problems can be defined by restricting the type of formulas, placing limits on the number of pre-and postconditions, by restricting negation in pre- and postconditions, and by requiring optimal plans. For these types of restrictions, I show when planning is tractable (polynomial) and intractable (NP-hard). In general, it is PSPACE-complete to determine if a given planning instance has any solutions. Extremely severe restrictions on both the operators and the formulas are required to guarantee polynomial time or even NP-completeness. For example, when only ground literals are permitted, determining plan existence is PSPACE-complete even if operators are limited to two preconditions and two postconditions. When definite Horn ground formulas are permitted, determining plan existence is PSPACE-complete even if operators are limited to zero preconditions and one postcondition. One of the interesting tractable problems is if each operator is restricted to positive preconditions and one postcondition (only ground literals). The blocks-world problem, slightly modified, is a subproblem of this restricted planning problem. These results in combination with previous analyses are not encouraging for domain-independent planning.}

Dosimeters were calibrated in a reference clinical linear acccelerator beam in a water tank at a reference facility at the Laboratoire National Henri Becquerel (CEA LIST/LNE LNHB, Saclay. Radiation qualities of 6, 12 and 20 MV were used with standard calibration conditions described in IAEA TRS 398 and non-standard conditions. Profile and depth dose ion chamber measurements were also made to provide reference values. Measurements were made in a water tank into which pipes could be inserted which held dosimeters in pre-determined and reproducible positions. The water tank was built to enable investigation of doses up to 60 cm from the beam axis. A first set of experiments was carried out with the beam passing through the tank. From this first experiment, penumbra and out-of-field dose profiles including water and collimator scatter and leakage were found over three orders of magnitude. Two further sets of experiments using the same experimental arrangement with the beam outside the tank, to avoid water scatter, were designed to measure collimator scatter and leakage by closing the jaws of the collimator. Depending on the energy, typical leakage and collimator scatter represents 10–40% and 30–50% of the total out-of-field doses respectively. It was concluded that all dosimeters can be used for out-of-field photon dosimetry. All show good uniformity, good reproducibility, and can be used down to low doses expected at distances remote from the subsequent radiotherapy target volume.}

Given the similarity in brain structure and behavior, biologists commonly assume that at least some animals, in particular nonhuman primates, share certain aspects of consciousness with humans. Brain scientists are exploiting a number of empirical approaches that shed light on the neural basis of consciousness. At present, it is not known to what extent artificial systems, such as computers, robots, or the World Wide Web as a whole, are or can become ‘conscious.’ What is needed is a theory of consciousness that explains in quantitative terms what types of systems, with what architecture, can possess conscious states.}

Computational approaches for characterizing object similarity have largely focused on the visual forms of objects or their linguistic associations. However, intuitive notions of object similarity may depend heavily on contextual reasoning—that is, objects may be grouped together in the mind if they occur in the context of similar scenes or events. Using large-scale analyses of natural scene statistics and human behavior, we found that a computational model of the associations between objects and their scene contexts is strongly predictive of how humans spontaneously group objects by similarity. Specifically, we learned contextual prototypes for a diverse set of object categories by taking the average response of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to the scene contexts in which the objects typically occurred. In behavioral experiments, we found that contextual prototypes were strongly predictive of human similarity judgments for a large set of objects and rivaled the performance of models based on CNN representations of the objects themselves or word embeddings for their names. Together, our findings reveal the remarkable degree to which the natural statistics of context predict commonsense notions of object similarity.}

Data were collected from 20 experts representing professions such as public relations, advertising, journalism, and design through a 12-question survey. In the analysis, the F-DEMATEL procedure was initially employed to determine attitudes towards AI technologies, followed by the application of the F-LMAW procedure to assess the magnitude of AI's impact on occupational groups. Findings reveal a nuanced stance: while professionals acknowledge the necessity of AI for their work, they are unwilling to accept unemployment due to more advanced AI. This newly identified structure, termed Post-Luddism, highlights concerns over technological unemployment, particularly pronounced in professions like journalism where job prospects are limited and creative thinking is paramount. In other communication fields, the intensive use of technology mitigates fears of AI harm. However, even in journalism, there exists a propensity to perceive AI as detrimental. These insights shed light on communication professionals' apprehensions and attitudes towards AI's effects. Policymakers and stakeholders can leverage this understanding to formulate strategic measures, considering the divergent perspectives among professional groups regarding AI, towards mitigating potential unemployment risks and fostering AI-adaptive strategies.}

Accurately predicting offshore wind power capacity is crucial for power system stability; however, current studies often overlook neighbouring installations. To address this, this study presents the Temporal Convolutional Network-Dual Attention Network-Sparse Transformer (TCN-DANet-Sparse Transformer) model, which considers the spatiotemporal coupling of multiple wind farms. Before detailing our model, we review the existing prediction methods, noting their limitations in capturing interconnected adjacent wind farms. Our model integrates spatial information from nearby farms to enhance prediction reliability. Through Pearson Correlation Coefficient analysis, we explore the temporal and spatial coupling features. Using overlapping sliding windows, we partition farms into subsequences, processed with TCN-DANet for efficient spatio-temporal feature extraction. These features are then input into the Sparse Transformer to improve the computational efficiency. Validated using a dataset from Kächele et al., our model outperforms the baseline on the London Wind Farm. In spring, for Case 1, the mean square error (MSE) of the main model decreased by 43.19 % compared to that of the TCN-DANet-transformer model. Similarly, for Case 2, the MSE of the main model is reduced by 41.69 %.}

Its innovative architecture includes a Quantum Embedding Layer for transforming input features into quantum states, a Quantum Hierarchical Interaction Network (QHIN) for capturing complex dependencies, a Quantum Deep Neural Network (QDNN) for enhanced feature processing, and a Quantum Cross-Hierarchical Unit (QCHU) to ensure seamless integration across hierarchical levels. This design achieves precise, transparent, and scalable detection of malicious applications, addressing the shortcomings of traditional methods. Evaluation on the Google Play Store Reviews, MobileRec, and Android-App-Recommendation datasets demonstrates the novelty and effectiveness of QEHIN. It achieves an accuracy of 98.86 %, precision of 98.78 %, recall of 98.82 %, and a kappa score of 98.54 %, significantly outperforming existing approaches.}

abstract = {The full exploitation of numerical simulation as an independent approach to the solution of engineering and scientific problems requires computing capability far exceeding that which is presently available. In this paper, the computing requirements posed by challenging problems in several disciplines are examined and contrasted with contemporary supercomputer resources. Of the means available to help fill the gap between the demands of computational science and the performance level of present-generation supercomputer systems, parallel processing appears to have the greatest potential for near-term success. Parallel computer architectures are reviewed and categorized according to processing units, memory, and interconnection scheme. Philosophies of parallel processing are discussed. They are distinguished by the number and size of the parallel tasks which they employ. Scientific problems are examined for parallelism inherent at the physical level. Typical algorithms and their mappings onto parallel architectures are discussed. Computational examples are presented to document the performance of scientific applications on present-generation parallel processors. Projections are made concerning software developments and machine architectures.}

At the first level students’ interpretation of exponents is based upon exponents that symbolize natural numbers. At Level 2, students’ knowledge acquisition process is a process of enrichment of the existing conceptual structures. Students at this level are able to compute exponents with negative numbers by extending the application of prototype examples. Finally, at Level 3 students not only extend the prototype examples but also reorganize their thinking in order to compute and compare exponents with roots, a concept which is quite different from the concept of exponents with natural numbers.}

Drawing on John Maynard Keynes’s projections of technological unemployment and the evolving nature of work, it argues that despite advancements in automation, work has not diminished but rather devalued. Design, understood as a type of knowledge work, faces an apparent existential crisis. GenAI grows adept at mimicking the output of creative processes. The article explores how the fear of the end of design work fueled by the rise of GenAI is rooted in a misunderstanding of design work. This misunderstanding is driven by managerialism—an ideology that prioritizes efficiency and quantifiable outcomes over the intrinsic value of work. Managerialism seeks to instrumentalize and automate design, turning it into a controllable procedure to generate quantifiable creative outputs. The article argues why design work cannot be turned into a procedure and automated using GenAI. Advocates of these systems claim they enhance productivity and open new opportunities. However, evidence so far shows that flawed GenAI models produce disappointing outcomes while operating at a significant environmental cost. The article concludes by arguing for a robust theory of design—one that acknowledges the unique ontological and epistemic boundaries of design work and underscores why design cannot be reduced to a procedural output.}

We have used life cycle assessment to determine whether cradle-to-gate, multiple configurations of the core waste-based processes integrating several carbon capture/utilization options can compete environmentally with other available ammonia technologies. Our waste-to-ammonia processes reduce potential impacts from abiotic depletion, human toxicity, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions relative to fossil-based and renewable technologies. Among the assessed technologies, coupling dark fermentation with anaerobic digestion and capturing CO2 for sequestration or later use is most efficient for GHGs, water, and energy, consuming 27% less energy and reducing GHGs by 98% compared to conventional ammonia. Water use is 38% lower than water electrolysis and GHGs are 94% below municipal waste incineration routes per kg NH3. Additionally, displacing conventional, high impact urea by integrating urea production from process CO2 decreases life cycle environmental impacts significantly despite increased energy demand. On a fertilizer-N basis, the ammonia + urea configuration without dark fermentation performs best on all categories included. Methane and ammonia leakage cause nearly all life cycle impacts, indicating that failing to prevent leakage undermines the effectiveness of new technologies such as these. Our results show that a green ammonia/ammonia + urea process family as designed here can reduce waste and prevent the release of additional CO2 from ammonia production while avoiding fossil-based alternatives and decreasing emissions from biogenic waste sources.}

Multi-core chips could, theoretically, lead to much better performance and computational efficiency than single-core chips. But so far, they have not shown general advantages for users, other than for operating systems and some specialized software. It is not easy to transform traditional single-core-based algorithms into multi-core-, multi-thread-based algorithms that can greatly improve efficiency, because of difficulties in computation and scheduling of hardware kernels, and because some programming languages cannot support multi-core, multi-thread programming. Therefore, a kind of multi-core-, multi-thread-based fast algorithm was designed and coded with Delphi language for the medium- and large-scale traveling salesman problem instances from TSPLIB, which can fully speed up the searching process without loss of quality. Experimental results show that the algorithm proposed can, under the given hardware limitations, take full advantage of multi-core chips and effectively balance the conflict between increasing problem size and computational efficiency and thus acquire satisfactory solutions.}

Complex challenges, such as sustainability and digitization trends, push these B2B firms to embrace new innovation methods that help them manage disruptive change. Service design thinking has emerged as an innovation management practice emphasizing a human-centered innovation process of user interactions, creativity, and learning mindsets. In this article, we aim to evaluate the challenges and develop a research agenda on how service design can effectively enable stakeholders' engagement during the B2B innovation process. We argue that to advance service design opportunities for stakeholder engagement, we need to address the unique complexities and challenges of stakeholder engagement during innovation from a systemic and dynamic process perspective. From a systemic perspective, we zoom in on the building blocks of stakeholder engagement and address multi-level stakeholder engagement platforms (i.e., innovation networks). From a dynamic process perspective, we treat stakeholder engagement as an emerging process and zoom in on the temporal and relational connections and hybrid orchestration to allow for both structural and emerging stakeholder engagement during innovation. We develop a stakeholder engagement journey in which we integrate service and innovation stages and propose how service design activities can support and facilitate the aforementioned challenges and complexities. Finally, we identify concrete research questions and, accordingly, develop a research agenda for future research on stakeholder engagement in B2B innovation trajectories.}

Here, I explore the function of the co-evolution analogy, provide an illustrative example from biology, and explore the varieties of co-evolution to which design might be compared. By doing so, I propose two possible directions for expanding the design co-evolution concept: (i) examining what co-evolves in addition to, or instead of, problems and solutions, and (ii) examining the different levels at which co-evolution occurs.

abstract = {Background
Several studies have demonstrated the effect of guided Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for depression. However, ICBT is not suitable for all depressed patients and there is a considerable level of nonresponse. Research on predictors and moderators of outcome in ICBT is inconclusive.
Objective
This paper explored predictors of response to an intervention combining the Web-based program MoodGYM and face-to-face therapist guidance in a sample of primary care patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms.
Methods
Participants (N=106) aged between 18 and 65 years were recruited from primary care and randomly allocated to a treatment condition or to a delayed treatment condition. The intervention included the Norwegian version of the MoodGYM program, face-to-face guidance from a psychologist, and reminder emails. In this paper, data from the treatment phase of the 2 groups was merged to increase the sample size (n=82). Outcome was improvement in depressive symptoms during treatment as assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Predictors included demographic variables, severity variables (eg, number of depressive episodes and pretreatment depression and anxiety severity), cognitive variables (eg, dysfunctional thinking), module completion, and treatment expectancy and motivation. Using Bayesian analysis, predictors of response were explored with a latent-class approach and by analyzing whether predictors affected the slope of response.
Results
A 2-class model distinguished well between responders (74%, 61/82) and nonresponders (26%, 21/82). Our results indicate that having had more depressive episodes, being married or cohabiting, and scoring higher on a measure of life satisfaction had high odds for positively affecting the probability of response. Higher levels of dysfunctional thinking had high odds for a negative effect on the probability of responding. Prediction of the slope of response yielded largely similar results. Bayes factors indicated substantial evidence that being married or cohabiting predicted a more positive treatment response. The effects of life satisfaction and number of depressive episodes were more uncertain. There was substantial evidence that several variables were unrelated to treatment response, including gender, age, and pretreatment symptoms of depression and anxiety.
Conclusions
Treatment response to ICBT with face-to-face guidance may be comparable across varying levels of depressive severity and irrespective of the presence and severity of comorbid anxiety. Being married or cohabiting, reporting higher life satisfaction, and having had more depressive episodes may predict a more favorable response, whereas higher levels of dysfunctional thinking may be a predictor of poorer response. More studies exploring predictors and moderators of Internet-based treatments are needed to inform for whom this treatment is most effective.

The growth of cadmium telluride with a dilute dopant is considered and found to be surprisingly sensitive to the amount of tilt - as little as one degree of misalignment of the ampoule axis from the gravitational vector produces a significant three-dimensional flow and a concomitant skewing of the dopant distribution along the surface of the growing solid. This indicates the need for precise ampoule axis alignment to ensure process reproducibility. Analysis of the dopant distribution along the solid-liquid interface of the tilted system reveals a surface region more uniform in dopant concentration than any corresponding region of the interface of the perfectly aligned system. For systems in which low radial segregation is very important, growth with an intentional axis offset may be beneficial.}

abstract = {Introduction
Schizophrenia is a clinical construct comprising manifold phenotypes underlying heterogeneous biological underpinnings. The Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) represents the standard tool in the clinical characterization of patients affected by schizophrenia, allowing to detect different clinical profiles within the disorder. Frontal lobes are a key area of brain dysfunction in schizophrenia. We investigated whether different clinical profiles in acute schizophrenia show differences in frontal lobes dysfunction or not.
Methods
We defined PANSS-derived principal components in a sample of 516 acute patients. These components were used as clustering variables in a finite-mixture model. Frontal lobe impairment, measured with the frontal assessment battery (FAB) score, was adjusted for disease duration and compared across the clinical clusters with ANCOVA. A supervised-learning approach was then implemented to reveal most informative PANSS items.
Results
A three-cluster solution emerged: a first profile with high-moderate expression for the positive and excitability/hostility component; a second profile scoring high on depression/anxiety and low on other components; a third profile, comprising the majority of the study population (74%), with a heavy affection on the negative-disorganization dimensions. After controlling for disease duration, frontal lobe impairment significantly differed across the aforementioned clusters, with the third cluster being the most affected. Two PANSS items presented the highest predictive value for FAB total score.
Conclusions
Among negative and disorganization symptoms, “difficulty in abstract thinking” and “lack of spontaneity/flow in conversation” are specifically mapped to higher levels of frontal lobes dysfunction, hinting at similar features with other neurological disorders involving frontal lobes.}

Existing works decoding words from imaging data have been largely limited to concrete nouns from a relatively small number of semantic categories. Moreover, such studies use different word-stimulus presentation paradigms and different computational models, lacking a comprehensive understanding of the influence of different factors on fMRI word decoding. In this paper, we present a large-scale evaluation of eight word embedding models and their combinations for decoding fine-grained fMRI data associated with three classes of words recorded from three stimulus-presentation paradigms. Specifically, we investigate the following research questions: (1) How does the brain-image decoder perform on different classes of words? (2) How does the brain-image decoder perform in different stimulus-presentation paradigms? (3) How well does each word embedding model allow us to decode neural activation patterns in the human brain? Furthermore, we analyze the most informative voxels associated with different classes of words, stimulus-presentation paradigms and word embedding models to explore their neural basis. The results have shown the following: (1) Different word classes can be decoded most effectively with different word embedding models. Concrete nouns and verbs are more easily distinguished than abstract nouns and verbs. (2) Among the three stimulus-presentation paradigms (picture, sentence and word clouds), the picture paradigm achieves the highest decoding accuracy, followed by the sentence paradigm. (3) Among the eight word embedding models, the model that encodes visual information obtains the best performance, followed by models that encode textual and contextual information. (4) Compared to concrete nouns, which activate mostly vision-related brain regions, abstract nouns activate broader brain regions such as the visual, language and default-mode networks. Moreover, both the picture paradigm and the model that encodes visual information have stronger associations with vision-related brain regions than other paradigms and word embedding models, respectively.}

These methodologies called the (Environmental) Life Cycle Assessment, the Social Life Cycle Assessment and the Life Cycle Costing, have the peculiarity to consider the whole life cycle of a product or process, from the extraction of raw materials to their end of life. At the same time, sustainable development has led to the strengthening of disciplines and novel technologies such as circular bioeconomy, industrial ecology, and nature-based solutions. In this context, constructed wetlands have been gaining popularity since they are a low-cost alternative for urban and industrial wastewater treatment in small communities. The performed life cycle assessments of these technologies have shown that, regardless of the model, configuration, or type of waste treated, they have low environmental impacts compared with conventional solutions (e.g., activated sludge system) due to low energy requirements, no chemicals consumption, and avoidance of off-site management and transportation practices. In terms of costs, constructed wetlands can drastically reduce the costs associated with wastewater treatment and management. However, more efforts should be made in order to define the social benefits of this technology (e.g., local employment generation, landscape improvement) and the quality of the recovered resources (e.g., treated water, fertilizer).}

It is argued that the approach represents a practical method for dealing with uncertainties and lack of knowledge in risk assessment. If the computed probabilities meet the pre-defined criteria with the conservative quantities, there is strong support for the “real risk” to meet these criteria. In this paper we look more closely into this practice, the main aims being to clarify what it actually means and what the implications are, as well as providing some recommendations. The paper concludes that conservatism should be avoided in risk assessments – “best judgements” should be the ruling thinking, to allow for meaningful comparisons of options. By incorporating sensitivity analyses and strength of knowledge judgements for the background knowledge on which the assigned probabilities are based, the robustness of the conclusions can be more adequately assessed.}

Few studies examine students' use of LLMs as learning tools. This paper focuses on the application of ChatGPT in engineering higher education through an in-depth case study. It investigates whether engineering students can generate high-quality university essays with LLMs assistance, whether existing LLMs identification systems can detect essays produced with LLMs, and how students perceive the usefulness and acceptance of LLMs in learning. The research adopts a deductive/inductive approach, combining conceptualization and empirical evidence analysis. The study involves mechanical and management engineering students, who compose essays using LLMs. The essay assessment showed good results, but some recommendations emerged for teachers and students. Thirteen LLMs detectors were tested without achieving satisfactory results, suggesting to avoid LLMs ban. In addition, students were administered a questionnaire based on constructs and items that follow the technology acceptance models available in the literature. The results contribute to qualitative evidence by highlighting possible future research and educational practices.}

abstract = {Here, we introduce a fully local index named “sensitivity” for each neuron to control chaoticity or gradient globally in a neural network (NN). We also propose a learning method to adjust it named “sensitivity adjustment learning (SAL)”. The index is the gradient magnitude of its output with respect to its inputs. By adjusting its time average to 1.0 in each neuron, information transmission in the neuron changes to be moderate without shrinking or expanding for both forward and backward computations. That results in moderate information transmission through a layer of neurons when the weights and inputs are random. Therefore, SAL can control the chaoticity of the network dynamics in a recurrent NN (RNN). It can also solve the vanishing gradient problem in error backpropagation (BP) learning in a deep feedforward NN or an RNN. We demonstrate that when applying SAL to an RNN with small and random initial weights, log-sensitivity, which is the logarithm of RMS (root mean square) sensitivity over all the neurons, is equivalent to the maximum Lyapunov exponent until it reaches 0.0. We also show that SAL works with BP or BPTT (BP through time) to avoid the vanishing gradient problem in a 300-layer NN or an RNN that learns a problem with a lag of 300 steps between the first input and the output. Compared with manually fine-tuning the spectral radius of the weight matrix before learning, SAL’s continuous nonlinear learning nature prevents loss of sensitivities during learning, resulting in a significant improvement in learning performance.}

Recently, the idea of permutation counting was introduced, which provides an estimator which can accurately estimate MLs of models for exchangeable binary responses. Such data arise in a multitude of statistical problems, including binary classification, bioassay and sensitivity testing. Permutation counting is entirely likelihood-free and works for any model from which a random sample can be generated, including nonparametric models. Here we present perms, a package implementing permutation counting. Following optimisation efforts, perms is computationally efficient and can handle large data problems. It is available as both an R package and a Python library. A broad gallery of examples illustrating its usage is provided, which includes both standard parametric binary classification and novel applications of nonparametric models, such as changepoint analysis. We also cover the details of the implementation of perms and illustrate its computational speed via a simple simulation study.}

ABSTRACT
Physical distancing and inaccessibility to laboratory facilities created an opportunity to transition undergraduate research experiences to remote, digital platforms, adding another level of pedagogy to their training. Basic bioinformatics skills together with critical analysis of scientific literature are essential for addressing research questions in modern biology. The work presented here describes a fully online, collaborative research experience created to allow undergraduate students to learn those skills. The research experience was focused on the development and implementation of the Organonitrogen Biodegradation Database (ONDB, z.umn.edu/ondb). The ONDB was developed to catalog information about the cost, chemical properties, and biodegradation potential of commonly used organonitrogen compounds. A cross-institutional team of undergraduate researchers worked in collaboration with two faculty members and a postdoctoral fellow to develop the database. Students carried out extensive online literature searches and used a biodegradation prediction website to research and represent the microbial catabolism of different organonitrogen compounds. Participants employed computational tools such as R, Shiny, and flexdashboard to construct the database pages and interactive web interface for the ONDB. Worksheets and forms were created to encourage other students and researchers to gather information about organonitrogen compounds and expand the database. Student progress was evaluated through biweekly project meetings, presentations, and a final reflection. The ONDB undergraduate research experience provided a platform for students to learn bioinformatics skills while simultaneously developing a teaching and research tool for others.}

Therefore, it is widely studied in distributed robotics research. This paper describes and evaluates a novel transportation scheme for differential-drive mobile robots that is, to the authors’ best knowledge, the most versatile scheme of its kind successfully evaluated with real-world hardware. The proposed scheme can conceptually deal with any number of robots and arbitrary polygonal objects, including non-convex ones, without having to retune, retrain, or reconfigure any of the control parameters between different scenarios. This is achieved by splitting the task into a formation control and a formation finding task, both of which are tackled with model-based approaches using distributed optimization. Formation control and formation finding are complicated by the robots’ non-holonomic kinematic constraints. Therefore, a tailored distributed model predictive controller is used for formation control. Finding formations relies on a multibody-dynamics representation of the robots-object system to properly account for contact and non-holonomic constraints. Due to these measures, the transportation scheme achieves a very satisfactory performance and dexterity in real-world hardware experiments utilizing network communication and distributed computation.}

For several decades, a number of studies have been focused on identifying the characteristics of such nonstationary gust front winds in a variety of manners such as experimental/numerical methods and full-scale measurements. Yet, beginning the dialogue on any guidelines for design practice has thus far not evolved, in part due to a limited consensus on such characteristics among studies in conjunction with paucity of available data needed for vetting and corroborating, which is further impacted by the presence of nonstationarity. In an effort to establishing a new design procedure for this type of wind load effect on structures, the gust front factor (GFF) framework has been proposed by authors that encapsulates both the kinematic and dynamic features of gust front induced wind effects on structures, which distinguish themselves from those experienced in conventional boundary layer flows. This study revisits the gust front factor framework seeking to take the next step toward a possible initial framework for codification of gust front winds from model-based and data-driven perspectives. A modular and extensible web-enabled framework to estimate gust front related wind load effects is envisaged to rationally and holistically quantify design loads. This would promote design practice to enhance disaster resilience of the built environment. In this context, a closed-form expression concerning nonstationary fluctuations for a case of a long pulse duration is derived to facilitate rapid evaluation of nonstationary turbulence effects. A preliminary uncertainty analysis is also carried out to assess the influence of uncertainties associated with the load effects of gust front winds and the reliability of GFF. In addition, a comparison of the model-based gust front factor with a recently introduced thunderstorm response spectrum technique to assess their relative performance is carried out. In view of the lessons learned from the history of the gust loading factor on codes and standards, a possible living codification concept through a learning and updating invoking the emerging “Design Thinking” approach is discussed.}

Structural neuroimaging studies have identified a combination of shared and disorder-specific patterns of gray matter (GM) deficits across psychiatric disorders. Pooling large data allows for examination of a possible common neuroanatomical basis that may identify a certain vulnerability for mental illness. Large-scale collaborative research is already facilitated by data repositories, institutionally supported databases, and data archives. However, these data-sharing methodologies can suffer from significant barriers. Federated approaches augment these approaches by enabling access or more sophisticated, shareable and scaled-up analyses of large-scale data. We examined GM alterations using Collaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite Toolkit for Anonymous Computation, an open-source, decentralized analysis application. Through federated analysis of eight sites, we identified significant overlap in the GM patterns (n = 4,102) of individuals with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. These results show cortical and subcortical regions that may indicate a shared vulnerability to psychiatric disorders.}

Dimensionality reduction and expansion (‘dimensionality transformation’) enable the brain to meet these demands. Reduction compresses sensory input into simplified, storable codes, while expansion reconstructs vivid details. Although these processes are essential to memory, their neural mechanisms for episodic memory remain unclear. Drawing on recent insights from cognitive psychology, systems neuroscience, and neuroanatomy, we propose two accounts of how dimensionality transformation occurs in the brain: structurally (via corticohippocampal pathways) and functionally (through neural oscillations). By examining cross-species evidence, we highlight neural mechanisms that may support episodic memory and identify crucial questions for future research.}

It will be interesting to discuss the temperature inside the house as one of the comfort factors. The study aims to analyze the temperature conditions inside the house, which are influenced by the slope of the roof. A two-dimensional unsteady state heat equation represents this temperature since the temperature distribution satisfies the heat transfer concept and changes over time. This governing equation will be approximated by the forward time center space scheme as one finite difference method and completed by the quadratic ghost point method since the house domain is an irregular shape. Van Neumann criteria are applied here to analyze the stability of the computational approach for this numerical scheme. Furthermore, these schemes are implemented in MATLAB application to quantitatively and visually display temperature dynamics. Some simulations completed these approximations to see temperature variations over time. The results show that the bigger slope causes the average temperature to be cooler. In other words, the temperature in the house will be more comfortable when the roof slope gets bigger.}

Traditional ANC methods, like the Filtered-x Least Mean Squares (FxLMS) algorithm, are effective in linear noise scenarios. However, they often struggle with more nonlinear and complex noise patterns. This paper introduces a novel approach using the brain storm optimization (BSO) algorithm in nonlinear ANC systems, which represents a significant departure from conventional techniques. The BSO algorithm, inspired by human brainstorming processes, excels in addressing the complexities of nonlinear noise by incorporating principles, such as delayed evaluation, free imagination, quantity and quality, and comprehensive improvement. By combining the BSO algorithm with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), a new ANC system is proposed that can adapt to a wide range of noise types with improved speed and accuracy. Experimental results showcase the superior performance of the BSO algorithm, achieving an impressive noise reduction of up to 48 dB (dB) in a 500Hz sinusoidal noise scenario, with a convergence time as fast as 0.01 s, outperforming the FxLMS algorithm by a significant margin. Moreover, in complex environments with multi-frequency and random noise, the BSO algorithm consistently demonstrates better noise reduction and quicker convergence, reducing noise levels by up to 27 dB within 0.001 s. The innovative use of the BSO algorithm in ANC systems not only enhances noise reduction capabilities, especially for nonlinear and complex noise signals, but also improves convergence times, paving the way for future advancements in ANC technologies.}

The paper starts with introducing a systems approach to business modeling. A competitive business modeling technique, based on the author's planning techniques is applied. Systemic decisions are based on common organizational goals, and as such business planning and resource assignments should strive to satisfy higher organizational goals. It is critical to understand how different decisions affect and influence one another. Here, a business planning example is presented where systems thinking technique, using Causal Loops, are applied to complex management decisions. Predictive modeling specifics are briefed. A preliminary optimal game modeling technique is presented in brief with applications to innovation and R&D management. Conducting gap and risk analysis can assist with this process. Example application areas to e-commerce with management simulation models are examined.}

However, one has to face with the rule explosion in these applications. To deal with this problem, hierarchical fuzzy systems with the compositional rule of inference (CRI) method have been constructed by a series of low-dimensional sub fuzzy systems. And it has been proved that hierarchical fuzzy inference method can efficiently restrain the explosion of fuzzy rules. Therefore, in order to increase the computational efficiency of the fuzzy inference based on the BKS when multi-input-single-output (MISO) fuzzy rules are involved, this paper mainly constructs two hierarchical fuzzy inference methods based on the BKS in which the if-then rules are respectively interpreted by fuzzy implications and ML-implications. Moreover, the validity of the two BKS hierarchical fuzzy inferences is studied with the GMP rules. Finally, two examples are employed to illustrate the computational efficiency of our proposed BKS hierarchical inference methods.}

This book about graphic design provides a channel for clear communication that supports visual thinking and acts as an interface to the vast information resources of the modern world. Visual thinking is a process that has the allocation of attention as its very essence. Attention, however, is multifaceted. Making an eye movement is an act of attending. Eye movements are executed to satisfy the need for information and can be thought of as a sequence of visual queries on the visual world. The idea of the visual query is shorthand for what one does when obtaining information either from the world at large or from some kind of information display. Understanding what visual queries are easily executed is a critical skill for the designer. The special skill of designers is not so much skill with drawing or graphic design software, although these are undoubtedly useful, but the talent to analyze a design in terms of its ability to support the visual queries of others. One reason why design is difficult is that the designer already has the knowledge expressed in the design and has seen it develop from inception and therefore cannot see it with fresh eyes. The solution is to be analytic and this is where this book is intended to have value. Effective design should start with a visual task analysis, determine the set of visual queries to be supported by a design, and then use color, form, and space to efficiently serve those queries.}

Drawing on the development and narratology literature, and employing computational linguistics (CL) techniques, this article compares the development narratives of 1076 Ashoka SEs across two periods (2009–2013 and 1994–1998) and two economies (developing and developed). CL analyses reveal important themes that characterize the identity, framing and orientations of development SEs across time and economies. The findings demonstrate how SE development narratives i) tend to be more pragmatic and solution-centric, and contain less political ideology than conventional development narratives, ii) combine extant development ideas and models but reframe them in new ways to address contemporary, complex development challenges, and iii) reflect a ‘bottom-up’ approach that encourages local ownership and collaborations with various social and economic sectors to achieve development goals. Overall, this study identifies the increasing importance of SEs in the development industry and reveals new aspects of SEs—their latent political framing, collective-utilitarian identities, and topical areas—that require further research via development narratives.}

Based on data about consumers’ music evaluations, it shows that taste hierarchies are configured as nested and relational classificatory systems. Nested, because rank systems of symbolic value are collectively recognized, reproduced, and negotiated by consumers not only at the level of genres, but also at lower, nested levels – e.g., sub-genre, artist, single artwork; relational, because the value attributed to music by consumers is ordinarily assessed and constructed through analogies and comparisons, and partly depends on the classifier's relative position in the social space. On the other hand, this paper makes a key methodological contribution: by analyzing large amounts of YouTube data through computational methods and in combination with survey data, it illustrates how the granularity of digital traces can advance sociological research on cultural categories, meaning structures and symbolic imaginaries.}

Thus this chapter provides examples of applying the principles in solving specific networking problems. The examples are drawn from real problems, and some of the solutions are used in real products. Unlike subsequent chapters, this chapter is not a collection of new material followed by a set of exercises. Instead, this chapter can be thought of as an extended set of exercises. In Section 4.1 to Section 4.15, 15 problems are motivated and described. Each problem is followed by a hint that suggests specific principles, which is then followed by a solution sketch.

Bayesian decision theory is a prominent computational model that describes how people make rational decisions using noisy and ambiguous sensory observations. However, critical questions have been raised about the validity of the Bayesian framework in explaining the mental process of inference. Firstly, some natural behaviours deviate from Bayesian optimum. Secondly, the neural mechanisms that support Bayesian computations in the brain are yet to be understood. Taking Marr’s cross level approach, we review the recent progress made in addressing these challenges. We first review studies that combined behavioural paradigms and modelling approaches to explain both optimal and suboptimal behaviours. Next, we evaluate the theoretical advances and the current evidence for ecologically feasible algorithms and neural implementations in the brain, which may enable probabilistic inference. We argue that this cross-level approach is necessary for the worthwhile pursuit to uncover mechanistic accounts of human behaviour.}

The strategy in the cases we look at is facilitated through the construction of what can be called mesoscopic models. Many models built in computational systems biology are mesoscopic (midsize) in scale. Such models lack the sufficient fidelity to serve as robust predictors of the behaviors of complex biological systems, one of the signature goals of the field. This puts some pressure on the field to provide reasons for why and how these practices are warranted despite not meeting the stated goals of the field. Using the results of ethnographic study of problem-solving practices in systems biology, we aim to examine the middle-out strategy and mesoscopic modeling in detail and to show that these practices are rational responses to complex problem solving tasks on cognitive grounds in particular. However making this claim requires us to update the standard notion of bounded rationality to take account of how human cognition is coupled to computation in these contexts. Our account fleshes out the idea that has been raised by some philosophers on the “hybrid” nature of computational modeling and simulation. What we call “coupling” both extends modelers’ capacities to handle complex systems, but also produces various cognitive and computational constraints which need to be taken into account in any computational problem solving strategy seeking to maintain insight and control over the models produced.}

The accuracy, stability, and generalization ability of the ML models created under both methods are evaluated in detail. Meanwhile, we have conducted in-depth comparative analysis of the two methods, which concluded that the accuracy of DeePMD model performs better and time efficiency of KRR model has more advantages.

This chapter directs the influence and relevance of language on thoughts. Though there has been no outlined domain on how exactly language effects cognitive architecture, the chapter critically studies five most relevant positions that have attracted defenders, critics since twentieth century to contemporary proposals. It discuses relativism, cognitive restructuring, thinking for speaking, language as modular interface, and language as social scaffolding. Linguistic relativism finds its roots in Romanticism as a reaction to the supremacist attitudes of the “Enlightment thinkers,” who were in the business of establishing hierarchies of languages. Cognitive system, being linguistic, acquires a supplementary system of cognitive representation and processing, which transforms the basic capabilities of system and gives rise to new possibilities. Since language is an interface between the modules it attempts to concede to some cognitive impact without challenging the general cognitive architecture of modules of thought as a successful representational vehicle. Lastly, human minds are socially and culturally constituted minds and therefore linguistic symbols (like other kinds of symbols and other social tools in general) allow the individual to externally discharge cognitive processes through language.}

Therefore, individuals with histories of suicidal ideation (SI) should exhibit a preference for active escape from unpleasant states, which exceed the effects of impulsive behavior under distress and lack of premeditation. Participants made active (Go) or passive (No-Go) choices in response to stimuli to escape or avoid an unpleasant state in a behavioral task. A drift-diffusion reinforcement learning model was used to estimate latent biases for active escape and avoidance in people with and without SI history. Bayesian logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between escape and avoid bias with SI. Escape bias predicted SI history, whereas avoidance bias did not. Escape bias remained a significant predictor of SI when controlling for negative urgency and lack of premeditation. Those with histories of SI demonstrate a decision-making bias favoring escape from aversive states. This bias remains significant after adjusting for facets of impulsivity linked to hasty decisions under distress and lack of premeditation. A heightened escape response may help clinicians to identify SI risk and develop targeted treatments to attenuate the escape bias.}

If CCS is expected to be adopted globally, transparent and reliable data and information must be readily attainable to all stakeholders to support the technology choice and decision-making process. The implementation of CCS requires effective communication and collaboration strategies. Still, materials and communication platforms to inform stakeholders about the potential and contribution of CCS are predominantly accessible in English since ongoing projects are mainly located in English-speaking countries. The Mexican Carbon Capture and Storage platform (MeCCS) was developed as a digital sharing and learning space for national stakeholders to obtain and expand their knowledge about CCS technology in Spanish. It was constructed as a boundary object (BO) to bridge different communities and disciplines, facilitating communication, understanding, and cooperation. The platform includes diverse elements that combine science and art to produce dissemination materials for different audiences to help build critical thinking and inform them about CCS technology. The platform confirmed its capacity to transfer and translate knowledge one year after its launch. It also served to connect different audiences in Mexico and globally and identify further areas of research and CCS-related efforts.}

abstract = {In many traditional machine learning methods, sampling is only a process of acquiring training data. However, some studies (on sequential Markov chains and particle filters) have demonstrated that sampling can be used for solving some intractable optimization problems in classical learning methods. Along this line of thinking, the relationships between sampling and learning are theoretically exploited in this paper, wherein the key feature of the sampling process is selecting representative samples from original data that can be modeled by a probability distribution. In theory, acquiring reliable samples is not an easy task for an arbitrary probability distribution. Motivated by approaches in evolutionary computation, rejection sampling and function approximation, a novel sampling strategy, called the evolutionary sampling, is proposed in this paper, and a machine learning method, called the evolutionary sampling approach (ESA), is put forward afterwards. Within ESA, a computing model, called the support sample model (SSM), is presented as well and is used to approximate an original density function. Accordingly, a concrete implementation of an evolutionary sampling approach (ESA) is proposed to seek the optimal model parameters of the SSM. Benefiting from the combination of rejection sampling and evolutionary searching, the ESA can theoretically converge to the optimal solution by minimizing the total variation distance, and can do this with high computational efficiency. Moreover, the normalized factor of a density function can be automatically estimated with high precision within the ESA. As a result, the ESA may be suitable for machine learning problems that could be transformed into density function approximation problems within a probabilistic framework. In addition, derived from the rejection sampling strategy, the ESA can also have online learning abilities required by large-scale data stream processing tasks. Theoretical analyses and application studies are carried out in this paper, and the results demonstrate that the ESA, as a novel way of machine learning, has several prominent merits aspired by past researches in machine learning.}

abstract = {The current practice of reporting positive and negative predictive value (PV), sensitivity (Se), and specificity (Sp) as measures of the power of noninvasive cardiovascular tests has significant limitations. A test result's PV and its comparison with other test results are highly dependent on the pretest disease prevalence at which it is determined; the citation of sensitivity and specificity provides no succinct or explicit quantitation of the rule-in and rule-out power of a test. This article presents a rationale for the use of an alternative standard for expressing predictive power in the form of positive and negative likelihood ratios, (+)LR and (-)LR. The likelihood ratios are composite expressions of test power, which incorporate the Se and Sp and their respective complements [(1 - Se) and (1 - Sp)], thus yielding single unambiguous measures of positive and negative predictive power. The likelihood ratios are calculated as follows: (+)LR = Se(l- Sp) and (-)LR = Sp/(I- Se). On analysis of the predictive value equations, the likelihood ratios equal the quotients of the posttest predictive value odds to the pretest prevalence odds for disease and no disease, respectively, as follows: (+)LR = (+)PVOd/POD and (-)LR = (-)PVOn/PON, where (+)PVO d is positive predictive value odds for disease, POD is prevalence odds for disease, (-)PVOn is negative predictive value odds for no disease, and PON is prevalence odds for no disease. Thus, the likelihood ratios are measures of the odds advantage in posttest probability of disease or no disease relative to pretest probability, independent of disease prevalence in the tested population. The quotients of the (+)LR or the (-)LR among test results studied in a common population are direct expressions of their relative predictive power in that population, The likelihood ratio principle is applicable to the evaluation of the predictive power of multiple tests performed in a common population and to estimating predictive power at multiple test thresholds.}

abstract = {The new differential algebraic (DA) techniques allow very efficient treatment and understanding of nonlinear motion in optical systems as well as circular accelerators. To utilize these techniques in their most general way, a powerful software environment is essential. A language with structure elements similar to Pascal was developed. It has object oriented features to allow for a direct utilization of the elementary operations of the DA package. The compiler of the language is written in Fortran 77 to guarantee wide portability. The language was used to write a very general beam optics code, COSY INFINITY. At its lowest level, it allows the computation of the maps of standard beam line elements including fringe fields and system parameters to arbitrary order. The power of the DA approach coupled with an adequate language environment reveals itself in the very limited length of COSY INFINITY of only a few hundred lines. Grouping of elements as well as structures for optimization and study are readily available through the features of the language. Because of the openness of the approach, it offers a lot of power for more advanced purposes. For example, it is very easy to construct new particle optical elements. There are also many ways to efficiently manipulate and analyze the maps.}

abstract = {This paper deals with the development of a new approach for supporting the improvement of information management and the overall information systems infrastructure. In particular, the paper discusses the application of lean thinking to information management; where information management can be considered to involve adding value to information by virtue of how it is organised, visualised and represented; and enabling information (value) to flow to the end-user (customer) through the processes of exchange, sharing and collaboration. The potential benefits of lean thinking are discussed and the fundamental barriers for its application to information management are highlighted. These include the need to characterise the nature of waste and establish the five principles of; value, value streams, flow, pull and continuous improvement in the context of information management. It follows that the core contribution of this paper is the development of an understanding of these critical elements and the creation of a conceptual framework for a set of lean principles within the context of information management. This framework offers a unique and arguably generic approach for supporting the retrospective improvement of information management systems and the overall information systems infrastructure.}

Professional developers of parallel software think in terms of parallel design patterns, which are markedly different from traditional (sequential) design patterns. It follows that the more we can teach students to think in terms of parallel patterns, the more their thinking will resemble that of parallel software professionals. In this paper, we present patternlets—minimalist, scalable, syntactically correct programs, each designed to introduce students to a particular parallel design pattern. The collection currently includes 44 patternlets (16 MPI, 17 OpenMP, 9 Pthreads, and 2 heterogeneous), of which we present a representative sample. We also present data that indicate the use of patternlets to introduce parallelism in CS2 produced a modest improvement in student understanding of parallel concepts.}

The increase in text data is more remarkable in current IT society. Although those are usually accessed with using Graphical User Interface (GUI), users except experienced computer users have difficulty in reading and organizing data with GUI. In particular, information curation such as grouping related data / information and finding relationship among them is difficult. In order to solve this problem, an interface that can access text data intuitively is expected. We are developing a TUI based on NFC, by which a user can move and group text data in a similar manner when handling paper documents. As one of the promising applications of the proposed TUI, this paper focuses on creative thinking support, for which touching externalized thought by hand is expected to be effective. An experiment is conducted, in which test participants did an analogy game with using the proposed TUI. The experimental result shows experience of using the TUI affects the participants’ self-evaluation about idea creation.}
