abstract = {Cancer is a complex disease characterized by a wide array of mutually interacting components constituting the tumor microenvironment (connective tissue, vascular system, immune cells), many of which are targeted therapeutically. In particular, immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently become an established part of the treatment of cancer. Despite great promise, only a portion of the patients display durable response. Current research efforts are concentrated on the determination of tumor-specific biomarkers predictive of response, such as tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, and neo-antigen presentation. However, it is clear that several additional characteristics pertaining to the tumor microenvironment play a critical role in the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Here we comment on the computational methods that are used for the analysis of the tumor microenvironment components from transcriptomic data, discuss the critical needs, and foresee potential evolutions in the field.}

abstract = {This study investigates pronoun interpretation by second language (L2) learners of English, focusing on whether first language (L1) transfer and/or processing difficulty affect L2 learners’ pronoun resolution. It is hypothesized that L2 learners’ non-target performance in L2-pronoun interpretation is attributable to two sources. The first is the computational complexity required for pronoun resolution, as argued in L1 acquisition by Grodzinsky and Reinhart and L2 acquisition by Slabakova et al. The second is how pronoun interpretation operates in L1. The hypothesis is tested by comparing Korean and Spanish L2-English learners’ interpretation of English pronouns using a Truth Value Judgment Task. Both groups had difficulty rejecting pronouns with local-referential antecedents when their proficiency levels were low. Additionally, Korean speakers showed more non-target responses than Spanish speakers due to their knowledge of pronoun interpretation in Korean. These results indicate that both L1 transfer and processing difficulty may be sources of L2 learners’ non-target pronoun interpretation, supporting the hypothesis of the study.}

abstract = {Abstract Experimental studies using human volunteers are limited to low acceleration impacts while whole cadavers, isolated cervical spine specimens, and impact dummies do not normally reflect the true human response. Computational modelling offers a cost effective and useful alternative to experimental methods to study the behaviour of the human head and neck and their response to impacts to gain insight into injury mechanisms. This article reports the approach used in the development of a detailed multi-body computational model that reproduces the head and cervical spine of an adult in the upright posture representing the natural lordosis of the neck with mid-sagittal symmetry. The model comprises simplified but accurate representations of the nine rigid bodies representing the head, seven cervical vertebrae of the neck, and the first thoracic vertebra, as well as the soft tissues, i.e. muscles, ligaments, and intervertebral discs. The rigid bodies are interconnected by non-linear viscoelastic intervertebral discs elements in flexion and extension, non-linear viscoelastic ligaments and supported through frictionless facet joints. Eighteen muscle groups and 69 individual muscle segments of the head and neck on each side of the body are also included in the model. Curving the muscle around the vertebrae and soft tissues of the neck during the motion of the neck is also modelled. Simulation is handled by the multi-body dynamic software MSC.visuaNastran4D. Muscle mechanics is handled by an external application, Virtual Muscle, in conjunction with MSC.visuaNastran4D that provides realistic muscle properties. Intervertebral discs are modelled as non-linear viscoelastic material in flexion and extension but represented by ‘bushing elements’ in Visual Nastran 4D, which allows stiffness and damping properties to be assigned to a joint with required number of degrees of freedom of the motion. Ligaments are modelled as non-linear viscoelastic spring-damper elements. As the model is constructed, the cervical spine motion segments are validated by comparing the segment response to published experimental data on the load-displacement behaviour for both small and large static loads. The response of the entire ligamentous cervical spine model to quasi-static flexion and extension loading is also compared to experimental data to validate the model before the effect of muscle stiffening is included. Moreover the moment-generating capacity of the neck muscle elements has been compared against in vivo experimental data. The main and coupled motions of the model segments are shown to be accurate and realistic, and the whole model is in good agreement with experimental findings from actual human cervical spine specimens. It has been shown that the model can predict the loads and deformations of the individual soft-tissue elements making the model suitable for injury analysis. The validation of the muscle elements shows the morphometric values, origins, and insertions selected to be reasonable. The muscles can be activated as required, providing a more realistic representation of the human head and neck. The curved musculature results in a more realistic representation of the change in muscle length during the head and neck motion.}

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is an indispensable simulation tool for predicting the emission of pollutants in the work environment. Welding is one of the most common industrial processes that might expose the operators and surrounding workers to certain hazardous gaseous metal fumes. In the present study, we used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology for simulating the emission of iron fumes from the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) procedure. A galvanized steel chamber was fabricated to measure the pollutant concentration and identify the size of the fume created by the SMAW. Then, the emission of welding aerosol was simulated using a method of computational fluid-particle dynamics with the ANSYS 2020 R1 software. The highest amount of welding fumes concentration was related to iron fumes (i.e., 3045 μg/m3 with a diameter of 0.25 μm). The results of the current study indicated that the local exhaust and general ventilation system can prevent the spreading of welding fumes to the welder’s breathing zone and the surrounding environment. CFD was also found to be an efficient method for predicting the emission of the iron fumes created by SMAW as well as for selecting an appropriate ventilation system. However, further studies that take the modeling of welding-generated emission of additional metal particles and gases into account will need to be undertaken.}

abstract = {Constructionism is at once a learning epistemology, a theory of learning, and a pedagogical approach that literally places education in the hands of learners. Constructionism situates students and mentors together in student-directed, project-oriented environments, often enabled with state-of-the-art computational technologies, to foster playful exploration and experimentation. Over time, shared learning experiences in constructionist environments may lead to the formation of learning cultures. To orient the design of constructionist environments for designers of engineering design education, this paper provides a historical context for Seymour Papert’s development of constructionism and distinguishes it from Jean Piaget’s philosophy of constructivism. Constructionism is introduced as an effort targeted at the reform of traditional education. Examples of constructionist environments for learning are then provided. The applicability of constructionism for the design of learning environments for engineering design is also discussed and observations are given for designing the tools, strategies, and activities that comprise constructionist learning environments for engineering design education.}

abstract = {There is considerable controversy surrounding the study of presidential debates, particularly efforts to connect their content and impact. Research has long debated whether the citizenry reacts to what candidates say, how they say it, or simply how they appear. This study uses detailed coding of the first 2012 debate between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney to test the relative influence of the candidates’ verbal persuasiveness and nonverbal features on viewers’ “second screen” behavior—their use of computers, tablets, and mobile phones to enhance or extend the televised viewing experience. To examine these relationships, we merged two datasets: (1) a shot-by-shot content analysis coded for functional, tonal, and visual elements of both candidates’ communication behavior during the debate; and (2) corresponding real-time measures, synched and lagged, of the volume and sentiment of Twitter expression about Obama and Romney. We find the candidates’ facial expressions and physical gestures to be more consistent and robust predictors of the volume and valence of Twitter expression than candidates’ persuasive strategies, verbal utterances, and voice tone during the debate.}

abstract = {A computational study was conducted to determine the most stable configuration geometry, and to evaluate the stabilization energy in the interaction between different test aromatic compounds. Dimers of benzene, naphthalene, anthracene, and, one trimer comprised of two benzene molecules and one molecule of naphthalene, were the subjects of the study. Gaussian 09 quantum chemistry suite ab initio calculations were performed by using MP2 method and the basis set G-311G**. The exponent for the polarized d orbital of carbon α d(C) was given the value 0.8200. Such value was obtained from the benzene dimer optimization with very similar results as those reported from the CCSD(T) method. This methodology was implemented for evaluating the stabilization energy trend with increasing number of aromatic rings in the interacting molecules. Among all the cases studied the energy minimum was obtained for the one having the conformation of displaced parallel molecules. This result seems to indicate that it is also possibly to obtain such stable conformation in the case of more complex aromatic systems of the same sort as the one considered here.}

Three experiments are performed by means of computational fluid dynamics simulations, and the comparisons show good agreement between measured data and predicted results. The simulation results provide insight into the temperature and flow fields for the configuration at hand, revealing an entrainment effect. The influence of the water spray characteristics on the downward smoke displacement due to drag and cooling is explained. Furthermore, an extensive sensitivity study of the simulation results to input parameters and mesh size is performed. The inner spray angle (related to vertical water flux) and droplet size are shown to be key parameters when simulating downward smoke displacement caused by a spray.}

abstract = {Broadband noise due to the turbulence-aerofoil interaction, which is also called the leading edge noise, is one of the major noise sources of aircraft (including the engine). To study the noise properties numerically is a popular approach with the increasing power of computers. Conventional approaches of using body-fitted grids at the boundaries would be convoluted due to the complex geometries, which can constrain the efficiency of parametric studies. A promising approach to tackle this issue is to use the immersed boundary method (IBM). Among various IBM variants, the volume penalization (VP) approach employs a masking function to identify the immersed solid boundary, and continuous forcing terms are added to the original flow governing equations to account for the boundary conditions. It is, therefore, efficient and easy to implement into the existing computational aeroacoustics solvers. In this work, the VP-based IBM is used to simulate the leading edge noise by combining with the advanced synthetic turbulence method. The simulations are conducted for both the isolated aerofoils and cascade, and the results are compared with the well-validated body-fitted grid solutions. The viscosity effect is also highlighted by comparing the results obtained by solving both Euler and Navier–Stokes equations.}
