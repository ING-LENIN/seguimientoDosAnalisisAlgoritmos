abstract = {Mel Ember was co-Principal Investigator in the Mason-HRAF Joint Project on Eastern Africa, a multiyear project aimed at developing and analyzing advanced computational agent-based models of human societies across 10 countries and 12 ecosystems. A major unsolved challenge in this kind of social science research is to devise a systematic way to compare, contrast, and communicate different models of social dynamics along relevant dimensions and characteristics, given the inherent complexity of most computational agent-based models. This article proposes a viable systematic framework for comparing models and illustrates its application using some of the models that Mel helped inspire and develop as senior project participant.}

abstract = {This article proposes and tests a reproducible framework for a computational method to measure social media-based deliberative discourse by analyzing commentary surrounding the Canadian convoy protests of COVID-19 vaccine mandates and restrictions. Employing a combination of analytic calculations, alongside tools such as Google Perspective and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC), this article assesses the quality of online deliberative discourse using established measures of deliberation including the variables rationality, interactivity, equality, and civility. We propose computational approaches to measuring these variables, and work toward validating our approach by observing correlations between an established computational measure of online deliberation-cognitive complexity. This computational approach is tested using Twitter and Reddit commentary related to the convoy protests that took place in Ottawa, Canada, during February 2022, which influenced the emergence of similar protests around the world. In addition to testing our proposed online deliberative discourse measurement framework, this case study provides insight into the deliberative characteristics of the Twitter and Reddit social media platforms.}

abstract = {The great demands for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) practitioners in industry have motivated universities to integrate CFD courses into undergraduate curricula. This article introduces a learning-centred CFD course that aims to train critical users of commercial CFD codes. The main features of the course include a project-based approach to learning and assessment-guided learning activities, both scaffolded by technologies. The implementation of the course is informed by contemporary pedagogical theories that encourage students to have the ownership of their own learning and constructively build their knowledge in an inclusive and supportive learning environment. The students upon completing the course have developed a conceptual understanding of the CFD principles and the importance of performing CFD simulations in a critical way, making them ready for more advanced CFD learning and practices. Course evaluation based on feedback from various sources demonstrates that the learning-centred approach is the key to the success of the course.}

abstract = {An advanced computational framework is proposed for the load and force estimations of isolated rotating wheel-tyre systems. The framework is constituted by a computational structured dynamics solver and a computational fluid dynamics solver that effectively simulated the flow around the wheel including tyre deformation. Two finite element analysis models of the tyre are built, where the multilayer hyperelastic approach provides a more representative response compared with the linear elasticity model. The flow around the wheel is captured through the overset grid method where the zero-gap approach enables desirable computational performance near the contact patch area. Computational solutions are compared with experimental data and other computational works demonstrating good agreement on the non-deformed tyre model in terms of aerodynamic forces. A grid sensitivity analysis is performed to quantify the level of discretisation uncertainty as well as a comparison with unsteady and steady state solutions. The work demonstrates that current computer-aided engineering software are able to tackle more realistic and accurate simulations of wheel rim tyre systems, opening the field to future research and development in rotating mechanical systems.}

abstract = {The pervasive role of computers in finance is strongly affecting the way investors operate on the stock market. In the last few years there has been a strong focus on short-time transactions that is the subject of many studies in the emerging field of computational finance. In this survey, we discuss the nature of the problem and give an overview of the most significant results. The critical analysis given in the paper covers classic time series predictions techniques, with emphasis on methods widely used in AI, as well as more recent attempts to make predictions on the basis of textual information extracted from financial portals and other relevant on-line sources. We claim that most results in the literature are not based on systematic evaluation over long time intervals and that, at the same time, vague declarations on the supposed efficiency of the market are not motivated.}

abstract = {We review recent evidence revealing that the mere willingness to engage analytic reasoning as a means to override intuitive gut feelings is a meaningful predictor of key psychological outcomes in diverse areas of everyday life. For example, those with a more analytic thinking style are more skeptical about religious, paranormal, and conspiratorial concepts. In addition, analytic thinking relates to having less traditional moral values, making less emotional or disgust-based moral judgments, and being less cooperative and more rationally self-interested in social dilemmas. Analytic thinkers are even less likely to offload thinking to smartphone technology and may be more creative. Taken together, these results indicate that the propensity to think analytically has major consequences for individual psychology.}

abstract = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) are at the core of post-transcriptional regulation and thus of gene expression control at the RNA level. One of the principal challenges in the field of gene expression regulation is to understand RBPs mechanism of action. As a result of recent evolution of experimental techniques, it is now possible to obtain the RNA regions recognized by RBPs on a transcriptome-wide scale. In fact, CLIP-seq protocols use the joint action of CLIP, crosslinking immunoprecipitation, and high-throughput sequencing to recover the transcriptome-wide set of interaction regions for a particular protein. Nevertheless, computational methods are necessary to process CLIP-seq experimental data and are a key to advancement in the understanding of gene regulatory mechanisms. Considering the importance of computational methods in this area, we present a review of the current status of computational approaches used and proposed for CLIP-seq data.}
