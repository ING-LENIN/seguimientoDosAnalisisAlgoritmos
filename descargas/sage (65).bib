abstract = {In this paper, we discuss a computational model that is able to detect and build word-like representations on the basis of sensory input. The model is designed and tested with a further aim to investigate how infants may learn to communicate by means of spoken language. The computational model makes use of a memory, a perception module, and the concept of “learning drive”. Learning takes place within a communicative loop between a “caregiver” and the “learner”. Experiments carried out on three European languages with different genetic background (Finnish, Swedish, and Dutch) show that a robust word representation can be learned in using less than 100 acoustic tokens (examples) of that word. The model is inspired by the memory structure that is assumed functional for human cognitive processing.}

abstract = {This paper proposes a computational approach to sociology. I argue that computational sociology is not just another specialty within an already fragmented discipline but that it provides an opportunity to integrate traditionally disparate approaches within sociology and provides a foundation for transforming sociology in the 2Ist century. I discuss important changes in computing that offer new opportunities for sociology and illustrate those points with examples of ongoing sociological research. The potential advantages of such an approach are identified and some of the characteristics of computational sociology are described. Keywords: sociology, computers, computational sociology, paradigm change, research methodology.}

abstract = {Apoptosis is the phenotypic result of an active, regulated process of self-destruction. Following various cellular insults, apoptosis has been demonstrated in numerous unicellular eukaryotes, but very little is known about the genes and proteins that initiate and execute this process in this group of organisms. A bioinformatic approach presents an array of powerful methods to direct investigators in the identification of the apoptosis machinery in protozoans. In this review, we discuss some of the available computational methods and illustrate how they may be applied using the identification of a Plasmodium falciparum metacaspase gene as an example.}

abstract = {Extracorporeal endotoxin removal by means of the Toraymyxin device is based on the ability of polymyxin B to bind endotoxins with a high specificity. The endotoxins/polymyxin molecular interactions were computationally analyzed in a parallel work (Part I). In this paper we investigate with a multi-scale approach the phenomena involving blood and plasma fluid dynamics inside the device. The macro- and mesoscale phenomena were studied by means of 3D models using computational fluid dynamics. The flow behavior in the sorbent material was focused, modeling the sorbent as a homogeneous porous medium at the macroscale level, or accounting for the realistic geometry of its knitted fibers at the mesoscale level. A microscale model was then developed to analyze the behavior of endotoxin molecules subjected to the competition of flow drag and molecular attraction by fibergrafted polymyxin B. The macroscale results showed that a very regular flow field develops in the sorbent, furthermore supplying the peak velocity to be input in the lower-scale model. The mesoscale analysis yielded the realistic range for wall shear stresses (WSSs) acting on fiber walls. With WSS values in the entire range, the results of the microscale analysis demonstrated that the capability of polymyxin B to capture endotoxin molecules from the flow extends at distances one order of magnitude greater than the characteristic distance of the stable intermolecular bond. We conclude that the use of an integrated, multi-scale analysis allows for a comprehensive understanding of the complex mechanisms involved in endotoxin sorption phenomena with immobilized polymyxin B.}

abstract = {In this study, NiTi shape memory alloys coupled in series with Al are considered as building blocks for thermal diodes. It is shown that the strong nonlinearity in the temperature-dependent thermal properties of NiTi in conjunction with the very different thermal properties of Al can result into a thermal diode of high thermal rectification ratio. As a first level of study, Ni50Ti50 is considered and the effects of various NiTi-Al geometrical configurations, initial temperature, and temperature difference at two ends on the thermal rectification ratio are studied numerically. Within the adopted temperature range (300–400 K, where phase transformation in NiTi occurs), it is shown that NiTi-Al thermal diodes are feasible with rectification ratio up to 4.8, which is quite higher than the ratios in currently known solid-state thermal diodes. This fundamental computational study could provide an important basis and motivation for the development of the next generation of high-temperature solid-state thermal diodes based on smart material such as NiTi shape memory alloys or others.}

abstract = {Although in the ionizing radiation field many concepts and processes are currently recognized as radiobiological, there are also probabilistic ones, and a probabilistic treatment makes a better understanding about them. The purpose of this study is to develop a new radiobiological simulator that calculates the tumor control probability (TCP) for a tumor heterogeneously irradiated from a fractioned treatment. The three possible types of cells and the results of interactions of ionizing radiation with each cell of a determined volume are analyzed. For an irradiated region with a dose per fraction d, the simulator determines the radiation biological effects using the cell kill (K) and cell sub-lethal damage, volume, cell density, cell repair of damaged cells during the interfractions, and number of fractions. K is determined from its probabilistic complement, the cell survival (S), described with the linear-quadratic (LQ) S(d) model as K = 1 −LQ S(d). TCP is calculated from computational simulations as in the ratio of simulations with K = 100% and their total. This application opens new avenues for theoretical and experimental investigations concerning simulations of radiation treatments, and methodologies for therapy optimizations. Our simulator represents a novel methodology as TCP is calculated without analytical formulas, but based on its own probabilistic definition.}

abstract = {The establishment of a healthy indoor environment requires the accurate evaluation of an individual’s exposure to pollutants. The concentration of indoor chemical pollutants is a representative indicator for such evaluation and is generally measured on-site. Moreover, material flow analysis (MFA), using macroscopic statistical data, is a reasonable method for objectively evaluating pollution on a wide scale; however, no effective strategy exists for the prediction of indoor air pollution, nor for the assessment of an individual’s exposure from social stock data. Accordingly, we developed a novel integration method comprising MFA and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with a computer-simulated person (CSP) to establish a framework for evaluating indoor pollutant concentration and individual exposure of residents. We focused on diethyl-hexyl phthalate (DEHP) and first estimated the amount of DEHP-containing product accumulation in Japan by MFA. Second, we conducted a thorough survey and measurement of DEHP emission rates. Using these results as boundary conditions for indoor CFD with CSP, the individual exposure of a resident, in a standard residential house, was quantitatively evaluated. The total daily exposure per unit of body weight was estimated to be more than 100 (μg/kg/d) in the worst-case scenario which was considered the upper limit for exposure in this analysis.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hemocompatibility is highly affected by the flow field in Left Ventricular Assistant Devices (LVAD). OBJECTIVE: An asymmetric inflow and outflow channel arrangement with a 45° intersection angle with respect to the blood chamber is proposed to approximate the vascular structure of the aorta and left atrium on the left ventricle. The structure is expected to develop uninterruptible vortex flow state which is similar to the flow state in human left ventricle. METHODS: The Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) asymmetric model is simulated using ANSYS workbench. To validate the velocity field calculated by CFD, a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) experiment is conducted. RESULTS: The CFD results show that the proposed blood chamber could generate a shifting vortex flow that would be redirected to the aorta during ejection to form a persistent recirculating flow state, which is similar to the echocardiographic flow state in left ventricle. Both the PIV and the CFD results show the development of a persistent vortex during the pulsatile period. Comparison of the qualitative flow pattern and quantitative probed velocity histories in a pulsatile period shows a good agreement between the CFD and PIV data. CONCLUSION: The goal of developing persistent quasi intra-ventricle vortex flow state in LVAD is realized.}

abstract = {Current theories of artificial intelligence (AI) generally exclude human emotions. The idea at the core of such theories could be described as ‘cognition is computing’; that is, that human psychological and symbolic representations and the operations involved in structuring such representations in human thinking and intelligence can be converted by AI into a series of cognitive symbolic representations and calculations in a manner that simulates human intelligence. However, after decades of development, the cognitive computing doctrine has encountered many difficulties, both in theory and in practice; in particular, it is far from approaching real human intelligence. Real human intelligence runs through the whole process of the emotions. The core and motivation of rational thinking are derived from the emotions. Intelligence without emotion neither exists nor is meaningful. For example, the idea of ‘hot thinking’ proposed by Paul Thagard, a philosopher of cognitive science, discusses the mechanism of the emotions in human cognition and the thinking process. Through an analysis from the perspectives of cognitive neurology, cognitive psychology and social anthropology, this article notes that there may be a type of thinking that could be called ‘emotional thinking’. This type of thinking includes complex emotional factors during the cognitive processes. The term is used to refer to the capacity to process information and use emotions to integrate information in order to arrive at the right decisions and reactions. This type of thinking can be divided into two types according to the role of cognition: positive and negative emotional thinking. That division reflects opposite forces in the cognitive process. In the future, ‘emotional computing’ will cause an important acceleration in the development of AI consciousness. The foundation of AI consciousness is emotional computing based on the simulation of emotional thinking.}
