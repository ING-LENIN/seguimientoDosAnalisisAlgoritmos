N2 - This article discusses interaction between multimodal representations of architectural design knowledge, particularly focusing on relating explicit and implicit types of information. The aim of the presented research is to develop a computational environment that combines several modes of representation, including and integrating different forms of architectural design knowledge. Development of an interactive digital-models library and ontological model of architectural design factors are discussed, which are complementary in nature. In a time when BIM software is seen as embodiment of domain knowledge and the future medium of architectural design, this paper presents an interaction between ontological representation of architectural design knowledge and its embodiment in interactive models, thus focusing on the process of design and design space exploration. In the digital environments that we propose, representation of different formats of knowledge, such as visual, linguistic or numeric, are integrated with relational and procedural information, design rules, and characteristics. Interactive search and query based on contextual constraints, and parametric variation of the model based on the information received from ontology are the underlying drivers for design exploration and development.

N2 - The efficient global optimization method is a global optimization technique that can select the next sample point automatically by infill sampling criteria and search for the global minimum with less samples than the conventional global optimization needs. Infill sampling criteria function consists of the predictor and mean square error provided from the kriging model, which is a stochastic metamodel. Also, the constrained efficient global optimization method can minimize the objective function when dealing with constraints under the efficient global optimization concept. In this study, the constrained efficient global optimization method was applied to the RAE2822 airfoil shape design formulated with constraint. But the noisy computational fluid dynamics data caused the kriging model to fail to depict the true function. The distorted kriging model would make the efficient global optimization deviate from the correct search. This distortion of kriging model can be handled with the interpolation (p = free) kriging model. With the interpolation (p = free) kriging model, however, the search for efficient global optimization solution was stalled in a narrow feasible region, so there were less chances to update the objective and constraint functions. Then the accuracy of the efficient global optimization solution may not be good enough, so the three-step search method is proposed to obtain an accurate global minimum as well as prevent the distortion of kriging model for the noisy constrained computational fluid dynamics problem.

N2 - Hospitals are plagued with a multitude of logistical challenges amplified by a time-sensitive and high intensity environment. These conditions have resulted in burnout among both doctors and nurses as they work tirelessly to provide critical care to patients in need. We propose a new machine-learning-powered matching mechanism that manages the surgeon-nurse-patient assignment process in an efficient way that saves time and energy for hospitals, enabling them to focus almost entirely on delivering effective care. Through this design, we show how incorporating artificial intelligence into management systems enables teams of all sizes to meaningfully coordinate in highly chaotic and complex environments.

N2 - Accumulation of soot particles on the wall of a constricted pipe, through which JP4 liquid jet fuel flows, is investigated numerically, using a pipe with a bump on its wall. The effects of particle size, particle-to-fluid density ratio and carrier fluid flow Reynolds number, on particle accumulation, are investigated. When the particles’ size is relatively large, with particle-to-fluid density ratio greater than unity, and at relatively large Re number, the largest accumulation of particles occurs near the bump’s front wall where those particles are blocked by the protruding bump and are too massive to be carried away by the nearwall, low momentum carrier fluid. Conversely, when either the particles’ size or the carrier fluid Re number is relatively small, or the density ratio is less than unity, the largest accumulation of particles occurs in one of three regions: on the bump’s rear wall, near the center of the recirculation eddy, or at the flow detachment point. Particle-accumulation ratio on the bump’s wall decreases monotonically as the particle size decreases (with the mass concentration of particles at the pipe inlet held fixed).

N2 - Heat transfer is a significant factor affecting internal combustion engine efficiency, emissions and performance. This study concentrates on model development for convective heat transfer and near-wall turbulent flow. The solution of complete fluid dynamics equations within the very thin-wall boundary layers is, and will be in the near future, very impractical in engineering scale flows with any present day method. An advanced numerical near-wall treatment method within the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes framework has been developed. The method solves simplified boundary layer equations for enthalpy, momentum, turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation in wall adjacent cells on cellwise high-resolution subgrids, adaptive to local conditions. The boundary layer equations include temperature gradient–induced density/multicomponent material property variations and complete imbalance contributions, for example, convection, transients, pressure gradient and external sources, in compact forms. The resulting numerical wall functions are valid with near-wall grid resolution ranging from the viscous sublayer to the fully turbulent region, thus avoiding the conflicting near wall resolution requirements of common low–Reynolds and high–Reynolds number turbulence models. The advanced near wall treatment method, comprising the numerical imbalance wall functions and accordingly modified low–Reynolds number turbulence model, is implemented in STAR-CD 4.12, extensively utilized in engine simulations. The near wall treatment method is validated against available measurements and direct numerical simulation data of strongly heated pipe flow. Performance of the near-wall treatment method in engine conjugate heat transfer simulations is also demonstrated. Local and average effects of variable properties and imbalance contributions on piston surface heat transfer, friction and turbulent sources are elaborated and contrasted to the standard high–Reynolds number near-wall treatment.

N2 - A detailed prediction of injection and air–fuel mixing is fundamental in modern direct injection, spark-ignition engines to guarantee a stable and efficient combustion process and to minimize pollutant formation. Within this context, computational fluid dynamics simulations nowadays represent a powerful tool to understand the in-cylinder evolution of spray and air–fuel charge. To guarantee the accuracy of the adopted multidimensional spray sub-models, it is mandatory to validate the computed results against available experimental data under well-defined operating conditions. To this end, in this work, the authors proposed the calibration and validation of a comprehensive set of spray sub-models by means of the simulation of the Spray G experiment, available in the context of the engine combustion network. For a suitable validation of the proposed numerical setup in addition to the baseline condition, gasoline direct injection operating points typical of early injection with homogeneous operation, late injection with high ambient density and flash boiling with enhanced fuel evaporation were also simulated. Numerical computations were validated against a wide set of available experimental data by means of an accurate post-processing analysis taking into account axial liquid and vapor penetrations, gas-phase velocity between spray plumes, droplet size, plume liquid velocity, direction and mass distribution. Satisfactory results were achieved with the proposed setup, which is able to predict gasoline spray evolution under different operating conditions.

N2 - While information technology has facilitated the collection of neverbefore-seen quantities of data, these data have not always provided the information needed by transportation professionals to support sound decision making. Computational intelligence (CI) has great potential to support the needs of transportation professionals. CI is a result of synergy among information processing technologies such as artificial neural networks (ANNs), fuzzy sets, and genetic algorithms. As the number of CI applications to transportation problems grows, so does the need to evaluate these systems. The issue of validating and evaluating transportation CI applications is addressed. A case study that evaluates the effectiveness of two CI paradigms, case-based reasoning and ANNs, for estimating the benefits of real-time traffic diversion is presented. The case study illustrates the need for regarding validation and evaluation as a part of the development effort and the need for tuning the design parameters of CI paradigms.

N2 - Ducted fuel injection (DFI) is an innovative method that curtails or prevents soot formation in direct-injection compression-ignition engines. DFI uses a simple duct, positioned outside each injector hole, facilitating the fuel/charge gas mixing before ignition. This reduces the equivalence ratio below two, in the autoignition zone, which in turn decreases soot formation. But this method also reduces fuel-conversion efficiency. This study investigates the effects of DFI on in-cylinder heat transfer. Experiments with conventional diesel combustion (CDC) and DFI were performed at four different dilution levels. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were carried out at conditions matching those of the experiments, and the simulations were validated by the experimental data. The CFD simulations enabled to examine of in-cylinder heat release and temperature distributions. The heat transfer to the piston, head, and cylinder was investigated. The results show that DFI increased the heat transfer to the walls compared to CDC under the same conditions. This could help explain why DFI has been observed to reduce fuel-conversion efficiency by approximately 1% (absolute) relative to CDC under certain conditions. The efficiency loss typically decreases with dilution, such that DFI can improve fuel-conversion efficiencies relative to CDC at higher dilution levels.

N2 - This study investigated the computational cost associated with grammatical planning in sentence production. We measured people’s pupillary responses as they produced spoken descriptions of depicted events. We manipulated the syntactic structure of the target by training subjects to use different types of sentences following a colour cue. The results showed higher increase in pupil size for the production of passive and object dislocated sentences than for active canonical subject–verb–object sentences, indicating that more cognitive effort is associated with more complex noncanonical thematic order. We also manipulated the time at which the cue that triggered structure-building processes was presented. Differential increase in pupil diameter for more complex sentences was shown to rise earlier as the colour cue was presented earlier, suggesting that the observed pupillary changes are due to differential demands in relatively independent structure-building processes during grammatical planning. Task-evoked pupillary responses provide a reliable measure to study the cognitive processes involved in sentence production.

N2 - It has been hypothesized that known words in the lexicon strengthen newly formed representations of novel words, resulting in words with dense neighborhoods being learned more quickly than words with sparse neighborhoods. Tests of this hypothesis in a connectionist network showed that words with dense neighborhoods were learned better than words with sparse neighborhoods when the network was exposed to the words all at once (Experiment 1), or gradually over time, like human word-learners (Experiment 2). This pattern was also observed despite variation in the availability of processing resources in the networks (Experiment 3). A learning advantage for words with sparse neighborhoods was observed only when the network was initially exposed to words with sparse neighborhoods and exposed to dense neighborhoods later in training (Experiment 4). The benefits of computational experiments for increasing our understanding of language processes and for the treatment of language processing disorders are discussed.
