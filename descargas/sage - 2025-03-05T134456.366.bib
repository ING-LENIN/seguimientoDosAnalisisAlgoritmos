abstract = {The work described is part of a programme exploring the utility of digital signal-processing techniques for studying certain aspects of the behaviour of water-waves. When such studies are undertaken in a closed wave-tank reflections from the boundaries can be troublesome. To this end a cepstral analysis has been attempted on wave-height measurements to locate and assess these reflections. The auto-regressive power-spectral estimate has been used to obtain the cepstrum with some success and the results are compared with those obtained by more conventional data processing methods.}

abstract = {The Parallel Curriculum Model (PCM) lends itself to considering curriculum development from different angles. It begins with a solid Core Curriculum and can then be extended through the Curriculum of Connections, Practice, and Identity. This article showcases a way of thinking about the creation of a PCM unit by providing examples from an Antarctic research expedition. The Curriculum of Connections is showcased through the practices of science and engineering and crosscutting concepts. The Curriculum of Practice is elaborated on through vignettes detailing collaborative activities on the ship. Finally, a special focus is placed on the Curriculum of Identity through profiles of people working on the ship who followed both traditional and nontraditional routes to their current careers.}

abstract = {This research is part of a broader investigation into the use of digital technologies in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) sector. The intention is to improve the ability of buildings to respond to context by proposing a skylight system that can adjust to external environmental conditions and internal functional demands. We call this responsive ability customisation. The proposed skylight system can adapt to different geometries, uses, locations, times of day and other contextual conditions. Customisation can be achieved by static and dynamic processes. Static customisation is achieved during the design process by selecting the form and size of the building, as well as the number, arrangement and size of the skylights, among other features. Dynamic customisation is accomplished after construction by changing the skylight aperture in real-time to control interior conditions. This paper focuses on the static process to find an adequate skylight configuration for a case-study pavilion.}

The concept of diversification is defined and the measure is modified to reflect its dimensions—the extent of diversification across segments (distribution) and the number of segments in which a firm operates. The refined measure makes it possible to better understand equivalences among firms with different diversification profiles.}

abstract = {Advances in data accessibility and analytical methods opened new frontiers for comparative studies of European legislative activities. However, these advances still need to be fully harnessed by legislative scholars for multiple reasons. We provide an overview of extant research agendas to identify these reasons and explore the opportunities for tapping the potential of big data and quantitative text analysis. We present significant data collection efforts, such as ParlSpeech, the Comparative Agendas Project and CLARIN, and highlight their respective value for, primarily, large-N comparative research focusing on European Union member states and the European Union itself. Our review highlights the most consequential gaps in the literature and shortcomings of available data and analysis. These include the lack of extensive historical and geographical coverage, missing harmonisation and cross-linking between separate efforts, no unified speech and document (bill, law) databases, and the unavailability of good-quality full-text variables.}

abstract = {The integration of structural health monitoring into life-cycle management strategies can help facilitating a reliable operation of wind turbines and reducing the life-cycle costs significantly. This article presents a life-cycle management framework for online monitoring and performance assessment of wind turbines, enabling optimum maintenance and inspection planning at minimum associated life-cycle costs. Incorporating continuously updated monitoring data (i.e. structural, environmental, and operational data), the framework allows capturing and understanding the actual wind turbine condition and, hence, reduces uncertainty in structural responses as well as load effects acting on the structure. As will be shown in this article, the framework integrates a variety of heterogeneous hardware and software components, including sensors and data acquisition units, server systems, Internet-enabled user interfaces as well as finite element models for system identification, and a multiagent system for self-detecting sensor malfunctions. To validate its capabilities and to demonstrate its practicability, the framework is deployed for continuous monitoring and life-cycle management of a 500-kW wind turbine. Remote life-cycle analyses of the monitored wind turbine are conducted, and case studies are presented investigating both the structural performance and the operational efficiency of the wind turbine.}

abstract = {The efficient and rapid mixing of fluids in a microfluidic channel is a challenging issue as it requires a large channel length and time to obtain the desired mixing. The mixing and hydrodynamic performance of spiral micromixers with grooves of different sizes, shapes, and numbers are examined in this work throughout a Reynolds number (Re) range of 1–150. Three distinct groove widths (100 µm, 125 µm, and 150 µm) were investigated for circular groove (CG) and rectangular groove (RG) shapes, and the total number of grooves was adjusted between four and fifteen. The results are compared to those from a spiral micromixer without grooves (spiral-noG). The results show that the mixing index increases with the number of grooves and groove width, with CG-15G having the maximum mixing efficiency across all Re. Wider grooves (150 µm) perform better than narrower ones, whereas groove shape has minimal impact on mixing. The CG-150 and RG-150 configurations provide notable increases in mixing at low Re (=1–10), with improvements ranging from +2.89% to +48.89%. At intermediate Re (=30–60), notable improvements are also seen, for example, at Re = 30, RG-150 shows an improvement of +87.54%. RG-150 consistently exhibits the highest pressure drop, though, as the number of grooves increases. Spiral-noG has the lowest cost at both low and high Re, but mixing costs increase in all configurations. The study concludes that micromixers with CG-100 and CG-125 are the best for mixing efficiency alone, while spiral-noG and CG-4G are suggested for real-world applications for a balance between mixing and pressure drop.}

The results show that young children are capable of generalising, can provide examples of relations and functions, can describe the inverse of such relationships and give valid reasons for how they found the inverse relationships. They also indicate that specific features of instruction assist this process, particularly abstracting underlying mathematical relationships, notably the materials used by the teacher and the children, the types of activities and the questions asked by the teacher. This leads to specific implications for the teaching of arithmetic in the early years.}
