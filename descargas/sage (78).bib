N2 - Genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can cause susceptibility to cancer. Although thousands of genetic variants have been identified to be associated with different cancers, the molecular mechanisms of cancer remain unknown. There is not a particular dataset of relationships between cancer and SNPs, as a bipartite network, for computational analysis and prediction. Link prediction as a computational graph analysis method can help us to gain new insight into the network. In this article, after creating a network between cancer and SNPs using SNPedia and Cancer Research UK databases, we evaluated the computational link prediction methods to foresee new SNP-Cancer relationships. Results show that among the popular scoring methods based on network topology, for relation prediction, the preferential attachment (PA) algorithm is the most robust method according to computational and experimental evidence, and some of its computational predictions are corroborated in recent publications. According to the PA predictions, rs1801394-Non-small cell lung cancer, rs4880-Non-small cell lung cancer, and rs1805794-Colorectal cancer are some of the best probable SNP-Cancer associations that have not yet been mentioned in any published article, and they are the most probable candidates for additional laboratory and validation studies. Also, it is feasible to improve the predicting algorithms to produce new predictions in the future.

N2 - Arterial hemodynamic forces may play a role in the localization of early atherosclerotic lesions. We have been developing numerical techniques based on overset or “Chimera” type formulations to solve the Navier–Stokes equations in complex geometries simulating arterial bifurcations. This paper presents three‐dimensional steady flow computations in a model of the rabbit aorto‐celiac bifurcation. The computational methods were validated by comparing the numerical results to previously‐obtained flow visualization data. Once validated, the numerical algorithms were used to investigate the sensitivity of the computed flow field and resulting wall shear stress distribution to various geometric and hemodynamic parameters. The results demonstrated that a decrease in the extent of aortic taper downstream of the celiac artery induced looping fluid motion along the lateral walls of the aorta and shifted the peak wall shear stress from downstream of the celiac artery to upstream. Increasing the flow Reynolds number led to a sharp increase in spatial gradients of wall shear stress. The flow field was highly sensitive to the flow division ratio, i.e., the fraction of total flow rate that enters the celiac artery, with larger values of this ratio leading to the occurrence of flow separation along the dorsal wall of the aorta. Finally, skewness of the inlet velocity profile had a profound impact on the wall shear stress distribution near the celiac artery. While not physiological due to the assumption of steady flow, these results provide valuable insight into the fluid physics at geometries simulating arterial bifurcations.

N2 - Abstract A hydrodynamic vortex separator (HDVS) has been modelled using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in order to accurately determine the residence time of the fluid at the two outlets of the HDVS using a technique that was developed for use in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). The results have been compared with experimental data [1]. It is shown that, in using CFD, it is possible to study the response to a variety of inputs, and also to determine the mean residence time of the fluid within the separator. Although the technique used for determining the residence time was developed for use in HVAC, it is shown here to be applicable for the analysis of hydraulic systems, specifically, wastewater treatment systems.

N2 - The aim of this article is to develop a three-dimensional computational model to simulate the traveling process of inlet distortion in fan and compressor with low calculated costs. The model is established based on the body force model in the framework of modern Computational Fluid Dynamics technology. The flow is assumed to be axisymmetric in each meridional blade passage. The impact of the solid blade shapes on airflow is modeled with blade blockage factor and blade body force. The relationships between blade body force and blade inlet Mach number together with attack angle are established with the deviation angle model and loss model. Meanwhile, the effect of the turbulent mixing is also taken into consideration. This developed computational code is then applied to the investigation of a transonic fan rotor and of a four-stage low-speed axial compressor under clean and distorted inlet condition. The predicted performance of both the fan rotor and the four-stage compressor with clean inlet are in line with the experimental results. A quantitative comparison is made between the computational results and the measurement data of the fan rotor with inlet distortion. Additionally, the transfer behavior of inlet distortion in the four-stage compressor is simulated by the model. All results demonstrate the effectiveness and practicability of the model.

N2 - In this study, free-surface effects on swimming are investigated by the application of the computational fluid dynamics method for the first time. The major goal of this study is to represent a new methodology to numerically investigate free-surface effects on swimming. Utilizing a two-dimensional solver with steady flow conditions, the numerical results for swimming at a fully submerged level are validated with the data presented by previous researchers. The validity of the results is also examined through the study of mesh independency and the control of a critical turbulence feature, entitled as non-dimensional wall distance (y+). Finally, for the analysis of swimming at the free-surface level, a two-dimensional time-dependent solver with a well-known multiphase mathematical model is implemented to simultaneously investigate two-phase flow interactions and wave propagation in the proximity of the swimmer’s body. The development of different flow topology features, including major vortex cores and secondary recirculation zones as well as turbulence mixing and flow updraft and downdraft, are investigated and used to compare free-surface swimming against fully submerged cases. While the drag coefficient continuously decreases for higher advance velocities for a fully submerged case, a gradual augmentation is observed for the drag coefficient at a free-surface swimming level. The obtained results suggest that while the proportion of wave drag is ignorable at low swimming speeds below 1 m/s, in the case of higher speeds, its amount enhances significantly and constitutes about 15% of the total drag. Moreover, the proposed methodology is demonstrated to be efficient in the simulation of flow characteristics and phase interactions in swimming at the free-surface level.

N2 - Driver distraction is one of the major causes for fatal car accidents. In a distracting activity, manual distraction is a triggered response of other types of distraction, such as cognitive and visual distraction. Therefore, recognition of manual distraction can contribute to the monitoring of overall drivers’ distraction. In this study, a computer vision-based method to track hand movement from the recorded driving behavior is proposed. This method integrates a low computational cost template matching algorithm using fast normalized cross coefficient (NCC) and a novel searching strategy. The proposed method was evaluated by the VIVA hand tracking data set. It achieves 50.83% of marginal accuracy percentage (mAP), 42.18% of multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA), 31.56% of mostly tracked (MT), and 19.29% of mostly lost (ML), and it outperformed a state of the art algorithm in MOTA and MT. Additionally, the computational cost of the proposed method is greatly improved, and it can run at around 11.1 frames per second. The outcome of this research will further assist driving distraction recognition and mitigation, and improve driving safety.

N2 - Societies differ in susceptibility to social influence and in the social network structure through which individuals influence each other. What implications might these cultural differences have for changes in cultural norms over time? Using parameters informed by empirical evidence, we computationally modeled these cross-cultural differences to predict two forms of cultural change: consolidation of opinion majorities into stronger majorities, and the spread of initially unpopular beliefs. Results obtained from more than 300,000 computer simulations showed that in populations characterized by greater susceptibility to social influence, there was more rapid consolidation of majority opinion and also more successful spread of initially unpopular beliefs. Initially unpopular beliefs also spread more readily in populations characterized by less densely connected social networks. These computational outputs highlight the value of computational modeling methods as a means to specify hypotheses about specific ways in which cross-cultural differences may have long-term consequences for cultural stability and cultural change.

N2 - High-content screening (HCS) using RNA interference (RNAi) in combination with automated microscopy is a powerful investigative tool to explore complex biological processes. However, despite the plethora of data generated from these screens, little progress has been made in analyzing HC data using multivariate methods that exploit the full richness of multidimensional data. We developed a novel multivariate method for HCS, multivariate robust analysis method (M-RAM), integrating image feature selection with ranking of perturbations for hit identification, and applied this method to an HC RNAi screen to discover novel components of the DNA damage response in an osteosarcoma cell line. M-RAM automatically selects the most informative phenotypic readouts and time points to facilitate the more efficient design of follow-up experiments and enhance biological understanding. Our method outperforms univariate hit identification and identifies relevant genes that these approaches would have missed. We found that statistical cell-to-cell variation in phenotypic responses is an important predictor of hits in RNAi-directed image-based screens. Genes that we identified as modulators of DNA damage signaling in U2OS cells include B-Raf, a cancer driver gene in multiple tumor types, whose role in DNA damage signaling we confirm experimentally, and multiple subunits of protein kinase A.

N2 - Abstract The piston bowl design is one of the most important factors that affect the air/fuel mixing and the subsequent combustion and pollutant formation processes in a direct injection diesel engine. The bowl geometry and dimensions, such as the pip region, the bowl lip area and the torus radius, are all known to have an effect on the in-cylinder mixing and combustion process. In order to understand better the effect of the pip region, three piston bowls with different pip designs but with the same lip area and torus radius were designed and investigated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) engine modelling. A commercial CFD KIVA3V with improved submodels was used to model the in-cylinder flows and combustion process, and it was validated on a high-speed direct injection (HSDI) engine with a second-generation common rail fuel injection system. The engine performance, in-cylinder flow and combustion and emission characteristics were analysed at maximum power and maximum torque conditions and at part-load operating conditions. Three injector protrusions and injection timings were investigated at full load conditions. The effect of injection timing and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) at the part-load condition was considered.
