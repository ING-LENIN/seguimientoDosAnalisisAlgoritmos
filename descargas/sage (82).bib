N2 - This article describes a methodology to recognize emotional states through an electroencephalography signals analysis, developed with the premise of reducing the computational burden that is associated with it, implementing a strategy that reduces the amount of data that must be processed by establishing a relationship between electrodes and Brodmann regions, so as to discard electrodes that do not provide relevant information to the identification process. Also some design suggestions to carry out a pattern recognition process by low computational complexity neural networks and support vector machines are presented, which obtain up to a 90.2% mean recognition rate.

N2 - Abstract This paper presents some results obtained during the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of internal flows inside a hydraulic component, using a scaling technique applied to numerical pre- and post-processing. The main aim of the work is to demonstrate the reduction of computational work needed for a complete analysis of component behaviour over a wide range of operating conditions. This result is achieved through the adoption of a methodology aimed at giving the highest level of generality to a non-dimensional solution, thereby overcoming the two major limitations encountered in the use of CFD in fluid power design: computer resources and time. In the case study, the technique was applied to a hydraulic distributor and computations were performed with a commercial computational fluid dynamics code. The key factor of this technique is the evaluation, for a given distributor opening, of the Reynolds number of the flow in the metering region. Provided that this number is high enough to ensure that the discharge coefficient has reached its asymptotic value, the characterization of the flow by a single non-dimensional numerical run can be shown. The theoretical contents of the analysis of the re-scaling technique, which focuses on the engineering information necessary in component design, are described in detail. The bases for its subsequent application to actual cases are then outlined. Finally, a fairly close correlation between numerical results and experimental data is presented.

N2 - The purpose of this descriptive study was to develop a computational fluency performance profile of 224 high school (Grades 9—12) students with mathematics disabilities (MD). Computational fluency performance was examined by grade-level expectancy (Grades 2—6) and skill area (whole numbers: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division; rational numbers: fractions, decimals) using the Mathematics Operations Test— Revised (MOT-R). The findings indicated that these high school students with MD were fluent only in computational skills at the second- and third-grade levels. Computational fluency was found with most whole number basic facts in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Lack of computational fluency was demonstrated on many items dealing with subtraction of multiple digits or items requiring regrouping, most multiplication and division items, and rational number items involving fractions and decimals. The results are discussed in regard to instructional programs and curriculum organization for high school students with MD.

N2 - Research shows charter schools are more segregated by race and class than are traditional public schools. I investigate an underexamined mechanism for this segregation: Charter schools project identities corresponding to parents’ race- and class-specific parenting styles and educational values. I use computational text analysis to detect the emphasis on inquiry-based learning in the websites of all charter schools operating in 2015–16. I then estimate mixed linear regression models to test the relationships between ideological emphasis and school- and district-level poverty and ethnicity. I thereby transcend methodological problems in scholarship on charter school identities by collecting contemporary, populationwide data and by blending text analysis with hypothesis testing. Findings suggest charter school identities are both race and class specific, outlining a new mechanism by which school choice may consolidate parents by race and class—and paving the way for behavioral and longitudinal studies. This project contributes to literatures on school choice and educational stratification.

N2 - Background Patellar tendinopathy (jumper’s knee) is characterized by localized tenderness of the patellar tendon at its origin on the inferior pole of the patella and a characteristic increase in signal intensity on magnetic resonance imaging at this location. However, it is unclear why the lesion typically occurs in this area of the patellar tendon as surface strain gauge studies of the patellar tendon through the range of motion have produced conflicting results. Hypothesis The predicted patellar tendon strains that occur as a result of the tendon loads and patella-patellar tendon angles (PPTAs) experienced during a jump landing will be significantly increased in the area of the patellar tendon associated with patellar tendinopathy. Study Design Descriptive laboratory study. Methods A 2-dimensional, computational, finite element model of the patella-patellar tendon complex was developed using anatomic measurements taken from lateral radiographs of a normal knee. The patella was modeled with plane strain rigid elements, and the patellar tendon was modeled with 8-node plane strain elements with neo-Hookean material properties. A tie constraint was used to join the patellar tendon and patella. Patella-patellar tendon angles corresponding to knee flexion angles between 0° and 60° and patellar tendon strains ranging from 5% to 15% were used as input variables into the computational model. To determine if the location of increased strain predicted by the computational model could produce isolated tendon fascicle damage in that same area, 5 human cadaveric patella-patellar tendon-tibia specimens were loaded under conditions predicted by the model to significantly increase localized tendon strain. Pre- and posttesting ultrasound images of the patella–patellar tendon specimens were obtained to document the location of any injured fascicles. Results Localized tendon strain at the classic location of the jumper’s knee lesion was found to increase in association with an increase in the magnitude of applied patellar tendon strain and a decrease in the PPTA. The principal stresses and strains predicted by the model for this localized area were tensile and not compressive in nature. Applying the tendon strain conditions and PPTA predicted by the model to significantly increase localized strain resulted in disruption of tendon fascicles in 3 of the 5 cadaveric specimens at the classic location of the patellar tendinopathy lesion. Conclusion The localized increase in patellar tendon strain that occurs in response to the application of tendon loads and decreased PPTA could induce microdamage at the classic location of the jumper’s knee lesion. Clinical Relevance The association of decreasing PPTA with increasing localized tendon strain would implicate the role of knee-joint angle as well as tendon force in the etiopathogenesis of jumper’s knee.

N2 - The friction type tensioner is an energy absorbing component in belt drive system which has hysteretic torque and nonlinear damping. In this paper, a hysteretic model is used for describing the tensioner’s operating torque versus the imposed angle, and considered into the dynamic analysis of a belt drive system. The modeling process for calculating the vibration responses of a belt drive system is presented, and two iterative methods are proposed for estimating the tensioner’s nonlinear damping in a varying excitation frequency. One timing belt drive system is taken as a case study. The system’s vibration responses, such as the oscillation angle of tensioner arm, the transmission error between pulleys and the hub load on pulley are calculated and compared with the measured values, which validate the presented methods. The influence of iterative method on the computational efficiency and iterative accuracy are both discussed. At last a modified method is presented to improve iterative efficiency. The presented technique can improve the computational efficiency with a good computational accuracy.

N2 - The purpose of this study was to examine the relations of various cognitive abilities and aspects of math performance with computational estimation skill among third graders. Students (n= 315) were assessed on language, nonverbal reasoning, concept formation, processing speed, long–term memory, working memory, inattentive behavior, basic reading skill, arithmetic number combination skill, double–digit computation skill, and computational estimation ability. One–way analysis of variance indicated significant differences in estimation skill among students of low, average, and high math computation performance. The unique predictors of estimation skill were arithmetic number combination skill, nonverbal reasoning, concept formation, working memory, and inattentive behavior.
