abstract = {Scientific discovery is a driving force for progress involving creative problem-solving processes to further our understanding of the world. The process of scientific discovery has historically been intensive and time-consuming; however, advances in computational power and algorithms have provided an efficient route to make new discoveries. Complex tools using artificial intelligence (AI) can efficiently analyze data as well as generate new hypotheses and theories. Along with AI becoming increasingly prevalent in our daily lives and the services we access, its application to different scientific domains is becoming more widespread. For example, AI has been used for the early detection of medical conditions, identifying treatments and vaccines (e.g., against COVID-19), and predicting protein structure. The application of AI in psychological science has started to become popular. AI can assist in new discoveries both as a tool that allows more freedom to scientists to generate new theories and by making creative discoveries autonomously. Conversely, psychological concepts such as heuristics have refined and improved artificial systems. With such powerful systems, however, there are key ethical and practical issues to consider. This article addresses the current and future directions of computational scientific discovery generally and its applications in psychological science more specifically.}

abstract = {In this article, we present the Collaborative Computational Steering platform CoCoS. It enables geographically distributed engineers to use steerable simulation and analysis facilities during a collaborative design session. The environment is based on a distributed component architecture composed of a central Collaboration Server, an arbitrary number of Simulation Servers and an arbitrary number of clients. The Collaboration Server manages the shared model consisting of a three-dimensional geometric model and additional semantic data like boundary conditions for a certain simulation. The Simulation Servers provide simulation and analysis data for the engineer’s front-end application and can be connected to the platform on demand. By using the explicitly available meta-model, the shared model can be dynamically adapted to the needs of simulation facilities that are not known a-priori. Exemplarily, the utilization of the CoCoS platform for the collaborative layout of a Heating Ventilation Air-Conditioning (HVAC) system is shown. In this context, the implementation and integration of an interactively steerable fluid simulator based on the lattice-Boltzmann method is discussed. This simulator allows obstacles to be inserted into the fluid domain, relocated, and removed from it during the simulation process and the impact of these modifications on the fluid flow to be seen immediately.}

abstract = {Building upon prior research on enterprise centralization and knowledge dynamics, this paper uses computational methods to assess the behavior and project performance of different organization-al designs in varying environments. The results reinforce contingency theory and suggest particular characteristics of different project environments that make one form relatively more or less appropriate than another. Practically, the answers to the research questions have direct and immediate application to project/portfolio managers and senior executives. Theoretically, broad classes of organizations are generalized and prescribe a novel set of organizational design guides.}

abstract = {This commentary advances the ‘hack’ as an urban concept. While the hack transcends existing literatures on the digital and informality, it is a distinctive concept and is being used systematically in new domains. I situate the hack conceptually, outline its empirical and methodological value and propose a framework to research the urban hack. Importantly, it is not just the technologies of hacking but the translation of computational logics to the urban that underpins the importance of the hack, as well as the critical need to set out a research agenda surrounding the hack within urban studies.}

Mathematical methods as well as computational methods and tools play a major role in the process of brain atlas building and developing atlas-based applications. Computational methods and tools cover three areas: dedicated editors for brain model creation, brain navigators supporting multiple platforms, and atlas-assisted specific applications. Mathematical methods in atlas building and developing atlas-aided applications deal with problems in image segmentation, geometric body modelling, physical modelling, atlas-to-scan registration, visualisation, interaction and virtual reality. Here I overview computational and mathematical methods in atlas building and developing atlas-assisted applications, and share my contribution to and experience in this field.}

abstract = {The proliferation of digital data has been the impetus for the emergence of a new discipline for the study of social life: ‘computational social science’. Much research in this field is founded on the premise that society is a complex system with emergent structures that can be modeled or reconstructed through digital data. This paper suggests that computational social science serves practical and legitimizing functions for digital capitalism in much the same way that neoclassical economics does for neoliberalism. In recognition of this homology, this paper develops a critique of the complexity perspective of computational social science and argues for a heterodox computational social science founded on the meta-theory of critical realism that is critical, methodological pluralist, interpretative and explanative. This implies diverting computational social science’ computational methods and digital data so as to not be aimed at identifying invariant laws of social life, or optimizing state and corporate practices, but to instead be used as part of broader research strategies to identify contingent patterns, develop conjunctural explanations, and propose qualitatively different ways of organizing social life.}

abstract = {Purpose: This article aims to shed light on a latest education informatization policy blueprint in China, titled Education Informatization 2.0 Action Plan, which was promulgated by the Ministry of Education in China on April 18, 2018. Design/Approach/Methods: The study is an analytical policy review based on the policy documents, theoretical discussion, and development of practice. Findings: This new Chinese education informatization policy was driven by three factors: the promotion of education informatization 1.0 in China, the requirement of education modernization toward 2035, and the response to “Wisdom Education.” The framework for action can be summarized as “One Goal, Three Tasks, and Eight Actions.” The main features involve innovation-driven development rather than technology-driven development, committing to the expansion of digital educational resources rather than the digital presentation of textbooks, and aiming at improving teachers and students’ information literacy rather than the applied skills of information technology. The future vision of the plan involves building new models on talent cultivation, education service, and education governance. The new models on talent cultivation involve establishing “Wisdom Teaching” mode, learning mode, and intelligent learning environment supported by artificial intelligence technology. The new education service models entail building the admission and sharing mechanism of quality educational resources based on National Network for Education and the public service platform and system for educational resources by means of the cloud computing and artificial intelligence. The new education governance models involve achieving precise, flat, and humanized education governance. Originality/Value: This article entails expounding the motivation, framework for action, main features, and vision of the education informatization 2.0 in China, which will be helpful for learning and understanding the current background, stage, and future path of China’s education informatization.}
