N2 - This study presents a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model to simulate the three-dimensional airflow in the trachea before and after the vascular ring surgery (VRS). The simulation was based on CT-scan images of the patients with the vascular ring diseases. The surface geometry of the tracheal airway was reconstructed using triangular mesh by the Amira software package. The unstructured tetrahedral volume meshes were generated by the ANSYS ICEM CFD software package. The airflow in the tracheal airway was solved by the ESI CFD-ACE+ software package. Numerical simulation shows that the pressure drops across the tracheal stenosis before and after the surgery were 0.1789 and 0.0967 Pa, respectively, with the inspiratory inlet velocity 0.1 m/s. Meanwhile, the improvement percentage by the surgery was 45.95%. In the expiratory phase, by contrast, the improvement percentage was 40.65%. When the inspiratory velocity reached 1 m/s, the pressure drop became 4.988~Pa and the improvement percentage was 43.32%. Simulation results further show that after treatment the pressure drop in the tracheal airway was significantly decreased, especially for low inspiratory and expiratory velocities. The CFD method can be applied to quantify the airway pressure alteration and to evaluate the treatment outcome of the vascular ring surgery under different respiratory velocities.

N2 - Infrared radiation signatures of gas turbine engine exhaust are suppressed markedly when equipped with a serpentine nozzle compared to an axisymmetric nozzle. The aim of this paper is to research more detailed flow characteristics of the serpentine nozzle, and to this end a double serpentine nozzle cold fluid test was conducted in this paper, static pressures on the nozzle walls surface were measured, and schlieren flow visualizations downstream of the nozzle exit were observed. Then numerical simulations of the experimental model were carried out using CFD software with k-ɛ turbulence model adopted. And the effects of geometric design parameters (the length ratio of first S length to second S length and the centerline distributions) on serpentine nozzle performance were investigated numerically. Detailed flow characteristics were presented including the distributions of static pressure, Ma number (streamlines), wall shear stress (limited streamlines), and the total pressure. Results show good agreement between the experimental data and computation. Static pressure distributions on the upper and down walls surface of double serpentine nozzle are completely different compared to the traditional axisymmetric nozzle. The rapid turning and steep passage slope of the serpentine nozzle would result in high friction loss and strong secondary flow loss, hence the value of the length ratio of first S passage to second S passage is recommended to be chosen from 2:5 to 2:3. The centerline distributions are crucial to the nozzle design for its influence on air acceleration inside the nozzle. The centerlines with a rapid turning at the exit would result in a high Ma number, which brings on high friction loss and secondary loss at the turnings. For maximum efficiency of centerline distributions, it is recommended that curves with a gentle turning at each serpentine passage exit should be chosen.

N2 - Different domains of software applications require that the project management’s development process be customized to its specific conditions and needs. One of the most widely used operation research is the development of a scientific software product. Numerous studies point to a wide gap among the various communities, processes, dynamics, etc., between the development of general software products and the development of computational scientific software products. This wide gap emphasizes the necessity for more suitable and more adjustable practices in project management and in the development of scientific software products. One of the most significant challenges in the development of scientific software is expressed in the different attitudes and expectations held by various stakeholders, in terms of the scope, objectives, and goals they envision for their software product. Although unique challenges in the development of scientific software arise at every stage of the process, we maintain that, by addressing the varying perspectives gap at the very outset of the project management process, one can reduce unwanted dynamics throughout the development process. A “project charter” is a critical formal statement that defines the scope, objectives and participants in a project in order to officially authorize the project and to ensure that everyone involved is aware of its purpose and objectives. Customization of the project charter can provide a response to the varying perspectives gap. This paper presents an approach to the generation of a customized project charter for scientific software products as an initial and essential step for the achievement of quality. We will demonstrate the implementation of the approach in one of our own scientific software development projects – a simulation software product used for the development of a fiber optic evanescent wave spectroscopy (FEWS) simulator.

N2 - In this work, a mean-line model with the row-by-row stacking scheme is developed to simulate the off-design operation of a multi-stage transonic axial compressor of an industrial gas turbine. A database of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation results validated with the field data is generated at different rotating speeds and pressure ratios by using CFD simulation tools and available detail geometry of the studied compressor. The compressor characteristic parameters including inlet/exit blockage factor, deviation angle parameter, rotor temperature and pressure coefficients, and the pressure loss of the stator for all stages, plus variable inlet guide vane, are extracted from CFD simulation results. Based on analytical/empirical relations in the literature, a generic formulation for the characteristic parameters is defined as a function of airflow parameters such as inlet Mach number, inlet flow angle, and velocity ratio. Since the accuracy of this type of model depends on the formulated characteristic parameters, and due to the error propagation potential of the sequential stacking solutions, a multi-objective optimization program is developed to specify the coefficients and exponent values of the generic formulations. The functionality of characteristic curves versus airflow parameters for different compressor rows is comprehensively investigated. The comparison between the results of the mean-line model and CFD simulations shows the high accuracy of the model. The developed model can be used in applications such as condition monitoring of in-service gas turbines, studying the effects of rescheduling the variable stator vanes, and investigating the wet compression process.

N2 - Self-expanding stents made of Nitinol, a Nickel–Titanium shape memory alloy, are used in standard medical implants for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Despite the increasing success, clinical studies have reported stent failure after the deployment in the human body, thus undermining patient’s safety and life. This study aims to fill the gap of reliable assessment of the fatigue life of Nitinol stents. We propose a global computational design method for preclinical validation of Nitinol stents, which can be extended to patient-specific computations. The proposed methodology is composed of a mechanical finite element analysis and a fatigue analysis. The latter analysis is based on a novel multiaxial fatigue criterion of the Dang Van type, combining the shakedown response of the stent and the complexity of phase transformation taking place within the material. The method is implemented in the case of a carotid artery stent. The implant configuration as well as the applied cyclic loading are shown to affect material phase evolution as well as stent lifetime. The comparison with the results obtained by applying a strain-based constant-life diagram approach allows to critically discuss both fatigue criteria and to provide useful recommendations about their applicability.

N2 - Abstract A computational model of the pregnant occupant, which is capable of simulating the dynamic response to acceleration impacts, is introduced. The occupant model represents a 5th percentile female at around the 38th week of pregnancy. A finite element uterus and multi-body fetus is integrated into an existing female model to incorporate pregnant female anthropometry. The complete model, ‘Expecting’, is used to simulate a range of frontal impacts of increasing severity from 15km/h to 45km/h. Three levels of occupant restraint, completely unrestrained, three-point seat belt, and three-point seat belt with an airbag, are investigated. The strains developed in the uterus because of loading from the seat belt and steering-wheel unit are presented, together with an analysis of stress distribution due to inertial loading of the fetus on the uterus. The unrestrained cases are shown to be the most dangerous to the fetus, owing to the large interaction with the vehicle steering wheel at the level of the placenta. The use of a three-point seat belt together with a driver airbag appears to offer the greatest protection to the fetus.

N2 - This article presents computational algorithms for the design, analysis, and optimization of airfoil aerodynamic performance. The prescribed surface curvature distribution blade design (CIRCLE) method is applied to a symmetrical airfoil NACA0012 and a non-symmetrical airfoil E387 to remove their surface curvature and slope-of-curvature discontinuities. Computational fluid dynamics analysis is used to investigate the effects of curvature distribution on aerodynamic performance of the original and modified airfoils. An inviscid–viscid interaction scheme is introduced to predict the positions of laminar separation bubbles. The results are compared with experimental data obtained from tests on the original airfoil geometry. The computed aerodynamic advantages of the modified airfoils are analyzed in different operating conditions. The leading edge singularity of NACA0012 is removed and it is shown that the surface curvature discontinuity affects aerodynamic performance near the stalling angle of attack. The discontinuous slope-of-curvature distribution of E387 results in a larger laminar separation bubble at lower angles of attack and lower Reynolds numbers. It also affects the inherent performance of the airfoil at higher Reynolds numbers. It is shown that at relatively high angles of attack, a continuous slope-of-curvature distribution reduces the skin friction by suppressing both laminar and turbulent separation, and by delaying laminar-turbulent transition. It is concluded that the surface curvature distribution has significant effects on the boundary layer behavior and consequently an improved curvature distribution will lead to higher aerodynamic efficiency.

N2 - The paper presents a review of existing literature in the field of coupling Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with Building Energy Simulations (BES) to better predict indoor environmental conditions and building energy implications. CFD is capable of providing a detailed analysis of airflow profile and temperature gradients in the space as well as better prediction of heat transfer involving convection and radiation. Whereas BES can provide dynamically changing boundary conditions to CFD to facilitate a precise transient analysis. Combining the two simulations provides a powerful framework to accurately predict building performance parameters. The review examines the variables exchanged between the two simulations and establishes that the Convective Heat Transfer Coefficient (CHTC) as the most important exchanged variable that can significantly improve the accuracy of energy simulations. Issues regarding the application of co-simulation mechanism are then discussed in terms of simulation discontinuities, along with strategies adopted by researchers to overcome the same. In the later sections, the review evaluates the applicability of co-simulation from the perspective of year-long building energy simulations and presents an overview of methods used in research to implement the same. Finally, the conclusions are discussed and the scope for future research in the field is presented. Practical implication: The review presents a critical analysis of essentially all major coupling strategies that can be used to perform a BES-CFD coupled analysis along with their strengths, limitations and possible application scenarios. Additionally, the problems associated with establishing the co-simulation are examined and various adopted solutions are presented along with methods implemented towards extending the practical applicability of such an analysis to encapsulate year-long simulations.

N2 - In this research, computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the effect of in-cylinder flow motion on the in-cylinder conditions and spark ignition–controlled auto-ignition hybrid combustion. It is proved in this study that asymmetric intake valve events could be used to generate the swirl-dominated flow motion. However, the macroscopic flows, such as the swirl and tumble, show very weak correlations with zone-to-zone conditions and hybrid combustion process. The detailed investigation on the in-cylinder zone-to-zone conditions indicates that the in-cylinder turbulent kinetic energy level and the mean flow velocity (Vm) around the spark plug would directly affect the early flame propagation process, which in turn affect the subsequent auto-ignition process through changing the heat transfer between central burned gas and end-gas. In addition, the increased temperature inhomogeneity of the spherical zones caused by the in-cylinder flow motion would prolong the auto-ignition combustion. The structures of the flame front and auto-ignition sites also demonstrate the significant impact of in-cylinder motion on the combustion process. It is found that the combustion mode transition is very sensitive to the in-cylinder turbulent kinetic energy, Vm, and temperature and its inhomogeneity, indicating that these flow and thermal conditions could be used to optimize the hybrid combustion mode operation. It also proves the fluctuations of the in-cylinder flow, and thermal conditions could be the reasons leading to significant cycle-to-cycle variations in spark ignition–controlled auto-ignition hybrid combustion.
