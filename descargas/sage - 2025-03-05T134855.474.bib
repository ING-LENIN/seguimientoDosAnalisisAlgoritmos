abstract = {Central government guidance seeks to ensure and enhance the quality of practice and decision-making across – and sometimes beyond – government. The Magenta Book, published by HM Treasury, is the key UK Government resource on policy evaluation, setting out central government guidance on how to evaluate policies, projects and programmes. The UK Centre for the Evaluation of Complexity Across the Nexus was invited to contribute its expertise to the UK Government’s 2020 update of the Magenta Book by developing an accompanying guide on policy evaluation and ‘complexity’. A small multidisciplinary team worked together to produce a set of guidance, going through multiple stages of work and drawing on a variety of sources including academic and practitioner literature and experts and stakeholders in the fields of evaluation, policy and complexity. It also drew on Centre for the Evaluation of Complexity Across the Nexus’ own work developing and testing evaluation methods for dealing with complexity in evaluation. The resulting Magenta Book 2020 Supplementary Guide: Handling Complexity in Policy Evaluation explores the implications of complexity for policy and evaluation and how evaluation can help to navigate complexity. This article, designed primarily for practitioners who might be interested in this guidance and how it was developed, describes the processes involved, particularly related to the interdisciplinary dialogue and consultation with other key stakeholders that this involved. It also briefly outlines the content and key messages in the guidance, with reflections on the experiences of the authors in developing the guide – including the challenges and insights that arose during the process, particularly around the challenges of communicating complexity to a broad audience of readers.}

abstract = {The emergence of block-based environments aims to facilitate the problems caused by the abstractness of text-based languages. Recent studies generally focus on the effect of having block-based experience on programming education. This study is an attempt to observe the transfer of previous programming experiences (block-based vs. text-based) into a three-dimensional game-making environment through the use of backwards fading. In addition to observation of transfer, students’ perceptions about the difficulty of practices were also investigated. Twenty-one senior university students participated in the study. They practiced through worked example, completion example, and full practice. Moreover, the comparison of the contribution of three examples, their perceived difficulty, and cognitive load has also been observed. There are four main findings that add value to the current literature. First, students having text-based programming experience had higher scores, which may be a sign of far transfer; second, completion example format was more efficient for students having block-based programming experience; third, full practice format was perceived as more difficult than either worked example or completion example; and fourth, based on the efficiency of example formats, completion example represented high efficiency for all students. However, average efficiency of all example formats has represented high efficiency for students, who had text-based programming experience.}

abstract = {Application of direct injection (DI) technology in small-bore engines, the type used in two- and three-wheelers, could improve their performance significantly. It is recognised that the use of high fuel injection pressure is beneficial in large-bore engines for a good mixture preparation. However, simple systems incorporated with low-pressure DI are desirable in small-engine segment of automobiles. Further, high fuel pressures will result in excessive wall wetting when cylinder dimensions are small. Extensive studies were carried out to investigate the minimum fuel injection pressure required for homogeneous and lean modes of operation in such small bore DI engine. The effect of spark plug protrusion in the combustion chamber was also investigated under the spray-guided configuration. Comprehensive experiments and CFD simulations were performed for estimating the engine efficiency, emissions, mixture preparation characteristics, fuel spray and fuel impingement on combustion chamber walls. Results have demonstrated that engine performance and emissions did not deteriorate when fuel injection pressure was reduced from 150 to 50 bar at full load. However, at very low pressures, like 20–30 bar, THC, CO and smoke emissions increased. Fuel injection pressure did not influence the lean limit, that is, equivalence ratio of about 0.77, but influenced the thermal efficiency at lean conditions. In order to attain high efficiency, under lean conditions, a minimum fuel pressure of 80 bar was required. The spark plug protrusion that resulted in a gap of 0.75 mm with respect to the incoming fuel spray cone has given the best engine performance, while higher protrusions affected the tumble flow and led to the stratification of charge near the spark plug, which resulted in elevated CO and smoke emissions. Hence, this work highlights that relatively lower direct injection pressures are suitable in small bore engines, which will impact the development of cost effective components for such applications.}

abstract = {The pedagogy, andragogy, and heutagogy (PAH) continuum have been widely endorsed within higher education and online learning over the years. Thus, the evaluation of research productivity has become relevant due to the emerging development of the PAH continuum as a theoretical framework. This paper aims to explore the research productivity within the PAH continuum by performing a bibliometric performance analysis. An iterative search strategy was performed to identify PAH authors and then investigate their research productivity over a 5-year period (2017–2022) using the SciVal analytics instrument by Elsevier. Drawing upon the results from multiple bibliometric analyses, the study explores publication productivity specifically in relation to the PAH continuum. This study revealed that distance education, learning, teaching, professional development, and lifelong learning have been the most prominent research areas within the PAH continuum. Within that, related topics were identified, including online learning, mobile learning, e-learning, and educational technology.}

abstract = {The fundamental nature of learning is a central problem in psychology. Traditionally, psychologists have assumed that learning must involve the formation of associations. Early last century, the pioneering work of Pavlov on conditioned learning in animals seemed to put this assumption beyond doubt. More recently, many psychologists came to believe that a different kind of process must underlie complex learning, such as language learning in humans, and that this process must be described as computational rather than associative. Whether complex human learning is associative or computational continues to be a subject of intense research. The articles in this Special Section turn this debate on its head by asking whether simple animal learning is associative or computational. Surprisingly, the question is still very much open, and excitingly, it appears quite tractable.}

abstract = {For Archimedes’ work to have furnished the ‘key theoretical tools’ for the scientific revolution, the texts must have been comprehensible to early modern readers. Yet as Archimedes’ readers and commentators have observed for centuries, his work can be very difficult going indeed. In this chapter, I explore how commentaries and other explanatory texts, like Guidobaldo dal Monte’s 1588 ‘paraphrase’ commentary to Archimedes’ Planes in Equilibrium, can help unfurl the difficulties of Archimedes’ sparse proofs by means of additional explanations and examples that help the reader develop their own ability to follow Archimedes’ reasoning. I give particular attention to insights from contemporary cognitive science into how strategic repetition of information, the materiality of the text, and highlighting connections between mathematics and the material world can all aid in the learning process.}

Eight Guilford-type tests were used to assess factors of creativity. Without statistical control, the gifted exceeded significantly the normals on 8 of 14 verbal factors but on none of the non-verbal dimensions. When different variables were controlled singly and in combination, significant differences appeared on the dependent variables. Separate correlations for gifted and normal Ss indicated differences in the way intelligence and achievement related to creativity factors for the groups.}

abstract = {We analyze information and communication technology in education initiatives in two South American countries: Bolivia and Uruguay. Utilizing qualitative data collection and analysis methods, we construct a comparative case study to trace the path of how national discourses—in response to the idea of globalization and initiatives promoting computers in education—were translated into policy goals, strategic implementation plans, and teaching and learning practices and outcomes. We document the role of the selected information and communication technology’s materiality in terms of portability and connectivity along this translation path. Our findings point to the importance of considering national discourse, often overlooked in information and communication technology in education studies, when examining initiative success and failure, and of conceptualizing materiality as more than merely the infrastructural foundation upon which information and communication technology in education initiatives are built. Understanding the role that materiality plays in interaction with national discourse may be especially important in guiding successful information and communication technology in education initiatives in developing countries, where financial resources are limited.}
