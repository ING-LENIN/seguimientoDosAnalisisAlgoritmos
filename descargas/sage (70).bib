N2 - The objective of data compression is to avoid redundancy in order to reduce the size of the data to be stored or transmitted. In some scenarios, data compression may help to increase global performance by reducing the amount of data at a competitive cost in terms of global time and energy consumption. We have introduced computational compression as a technique for reducing redundant computation, in other words, to avoid carrying out the same computation with the same input to obtain the same output. In some scenarios, such as simulations, graphic processing, and so on, part of the computation is repeated using the same input in order to obtain the same output, and this computation could have an important cost in terms of global time and energy consumption. We propose applying computational compression by using memoization in order to store the results for future reuse and, in this way, minimize the use of the same costly computation. Although memoization was proposed for sequential applications in the 1980s, and there are some projects that have applied it in very specific domains, we propose a novel, domain-independent way of using it in high-performance applications, as a means of avoiding redundant computation.

N2 - Numerical analysis is increasingly used for batch modelling runs, with each individual model possessing a unique combination of input parameters sampled from a range of potential values. Whilst such an approach can help to develop a comprehensive understanding of the inherent unpredictability and variability of explosive events, or populate training/validation data sets for machine learning approaches, the associated computational expense is relatively high. Furthermore, any given model may share a number of common solution steps with other models in the batch, and simulating all models from birth to termination may result in large amounts of repetition. This paper presents a new branching algorithm that ensures calculation steps are only computed once by identifying when the parameter fields of each model in the batch becomes unique. This enables informed data mapping to take place, leading to a reduction in the required computation time. The branching algorithm is explained using a conceptual walk-through for a batch of 9 models, featuring a blast load acting on a structural panel in 2D. By eliminating repeat steps, approximately 50% of the run time can be saved. This is followed by the development and use of the algorithm in 3D for a practical application involving 20 complex containment structure models. In this instance, a ∼20% reduction in computational costs is achieved.

N2 - Abstract Performance of centrifugal fans with unshrouded impellers strongly depends upon complex configuration of the asymmetrical flowfield in the axial direction, which is highly unsteady. The flowfield, in turn, is considerably affected by the design parameters of both scroll and impeller geometry, for which tip clearance is of particular interest. This article presents a three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation of the flowfield in three different unshrouded centrifugal fan impellers with varying tip clearances. A commercial CFD code, namely, Fluent V6.2.16 with a k-ɛ two-equation turbulence model was utilized in order to study the effects of tip clearance on the overall performance of each fan with the tip clearances ranging from 5 to 30 mm. The numerical results were compared with the experimental data reported previously in the literature by the present author and his colleagues, and excellent agreements were observed for each fan.

N2 - Abstract The term ‘whiplash’ was initially used to describe injuries to the neck caused by the head being forced backwards during a rear-end collision in cars without head restraints. The addition of head restraints in the 1970s was expected to solve this problem by preventing excessive extension of the neck but experience suggests the problem still exists. This paper reviews available experimental studies of whiplash and uses the data to construct a finite element model which is capable of dynamically simulating whiplash collisions and predicting the forces in all the relevant neck ligaments. For the first time, it is shown that trauma occurs long before the head hits the head restraint as a result of displacement between the head and the torso caused by the head’s inertia leading to markedly different acceleration histories. It is concluded that experimental and computational studies must be used together to produce progress in biomechanical studies.

N2 - Background: There is increasing evidence from animal and clinical studies that network hyperexcitability (NH) may be an important pathophysiological process and potential target for treatment in early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Measures of functional connectivity (FC) have been proposed as promising biomarkers for NH, but it is unknown which measure has the highest sensitivity for early-stage changes in the excitation/inhibition balance. Objective: We aim to test the performance of different FC measures in detecting NH at the earliest stage using a computational approach. Methods: We use a whole brain computational model of activity dependent degeneration to simulate progressive AD pathology and NH. We investigate if and at what stage four measures of FC (amplitude envelope correlation corrected [AECc], phase lag index [PLI], joint permutation entropy [JPE] and a new measure: phase lag time [PLT]) can detect early-stage AD pathophysiology. Results: The activity dependent degeneration model replicates spectral changes in line with clinical data and demonstrates increasing NH. Compared to relative theta power as a gold standard the AECc and PLI are shown to be less sensitive in detecting early-stage NH and AD-related neurophysiological abnormalities, while the JPE and the PLT show more sensitivity with excellent test characteristics. Conclusions: Novel FC measures, which are better in detecting rapid fluctuations in neural activity and connectivity, may be superior to well-known measures such as the AECc and PLI in detecting early phase neurophysiological abnormalities and in particular NH in AD. These markers could improve early diagnosis and treatment target identification.

N2 - In order to clarify the elasto-viscoplastic deformation behavior and strength of rubber blended semi-crystalline polymer, micro- to mesoscopic mechanical behavior was modeled by using large deformation finite element homogenization method. In this model, dimension of mesostructure is identified by the volume fraction of interface region around the rubber particles. The effects of strain rate and the size of rubber particles on the mesoscopic true stress—strain relation, strain rate distribution in mesoscopic area, and change in mesoscopic morphology with deformation are investigated by numerical simulation of uniaxial tensile deformation of semi-crystalline polymer with nonuniformly distributed rubber particles. A series of computational simulations clarified that mechanical behavior of blend polymer is strongly affected by the size of rubber particles. Mesoscopic true stress—strain relationship shows softening for blend polymer with large rubber particles, which is closely related to the distribution of strain rate on mesoscopic scale. When the rubber particles are large, local strain rate is highly concentrated in the ligament area between adjacent rubber particles, while it distributes in larger area of semi-crystalline polymer matrix in case of small rubber particles. The difference in these localized deformation leads to characteristic change in the size and shape of rubber particles with straining. Nonuniform deformation in mesoscopic area caused by heterogeneous rubber particle distribution is emphasized by high strain rate and large rubber particles. Furthermore, maximum mean stress generated in semi-crystalline polymer matrix is very high when the size of rubber particles is smaller than or ligament thickness is larger than a specific value. The specific thickness corresponds to the critical value for brittle-ductile transition of rubber blended semi-crystalline polymer obtained by impact test.

N2 - This study investigated the differences in programming novices’ intrinsic motivation and performance within a Scratch-based programming learning environment using a pretest–posttest intervention design. Specifically, this study aimed to examine what and how achievement emotions were aroused to impact learners’ academic success during Scratch implementation processes by employing regression analyses. One hundred and seventy-two undergraduates (Mage = 20.44, SDage = 1.09, 55.8% female) were voluntarily recruited to participate in a Scratch-based instruction workshop during a 6-week period. The workshop was structured with regard to preparation, Scratch-based programming learning and projects, and assessment activities and questionnaire implemented both before the instructional period and after the workshop. The results suggested that the Scratch-based intervention significantly increased students’ overall motivation and examination performance. Concerning achievement emotions, the outcome emotion of hopelessness first negatively predicted students’ motivation and performance. Anxiety then replaced hopelessness as a negative predictor, while enjoyment was the strongest predictor of motives and performance. Taking eight emotions together, the arousal of activity and outcome emotions within visual programming environments facilitated students’ emotion dynamics that impacted motivation and performance. The discussion and contributions concerning the mechanism behind the effectiveness of visualization and the emotion-performance relationship are presented herein.

N2 - Massive Open Online Courses have become a frequent platform for learners to acquire knowledge. This study aims to explore multiple factors influencing learner retention in MOOCs during the COVID-19 pandemic. To address this, we collected quantitative and qualitative data from questionnaires and qualitative data from interviews and then analyzed them through the Partial Least Square–Structural Equation Modeling to test 14 research hypotheses. The proposed research model and research hypotheses are empirically tested with 243 participants across the world. According to the results, support is found for all of the 14 research hypotheses. We confirmed 14 factors influencing learner retention in MOOCs. The result is beneficial for designers and manufacturers of MOOCs to improve the quality of the products and facilitate online or blended learning during this special time. It could also help students improve their learning experiences. Future research could examine influencing factors of learner retention in MOOCs with interdisciplinary cooperation.
