N2 - In recent years, citizen engagement in policy and research has gained considerable momentum. In the healthcare domain, patient narratives, through various mediums, have emerged as a valuable source of insight into the experiences of patients and the healthcare system. Recognizing the value of such textual data, diverse analytical methods have been developed, spanning from text mining to narrative analysis. This article presents experiments that combine computational methods, qualitative methods and citizen science for analyzing patients’ stories. In this article, we reflect on two experiments in which we combined these approaches, which we analyze through a generative lens. We distinguish three main effects of the experiments: they provide a platform for discussions as a “site of controversy”; they act as “mediator”, fostering new connections and mutual understanding among participants; and they serve as “tin opener”, stimulating substantive discussions about methodological development and substantive healthcare matters. Narrative reduction, which occurs when rich narrative data is simplified into structured quantifiable forms, is not inherently problematic; instead, it can be meaningful when combined with qualitative methods and citizen science, emphasizing the importance of utilizing diverse methods to balance authenticity and gaining broader insights. The study highlights the significance of collaborative sense-making and meaning-making in interdisciplinary research. Engaging patients, their relatives, and professionals in the analytical process, facilitated by tools like word clouds, promotes engaged discussions that yield actionable insights. Further development of such interdisciplinary approaches holds promise for a more nuanced understanding of patient experiences, fostering epistemological pluralism, and refining healthcare practices.

N2 - Purpose To assess if finite element (FE) models can be used to predict deformation of the femoropopliteal segment during knee flexion. Methods Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) images were acquiredonthe lower limbs of 8 healthy volunteers (5 men; mean age 28±4 years). Images were taken in 2 natural positions, with the lower limb fully extended and with the knee bent at ∼40°. Patient-specific FE models were developed and used to simulate the experimental situation. The displacements of the artery during knee bending as predicted by the numerical model were compared to the corresponding positions measured on the MRA images. Results The numerical predictions showed a good overall agreement between the calculated displacements of the motion measures from MRA images. The average position error comparing the calculated vs. actual displacements of the femoropopliteal intersection measured on the MRA was 8±4 mm. Two of the 8 subjects showed large prediction errors (average 13±5 mm); these 2 volunteers were the tallest subjects involved in the study and had a low body mass index (20.5 kg/m2). Conclusion The present computational model is able to capture the gross mechanical environment of the femoropopliteal intersection during knee bending and provide a better understanding of the complex biomechanical behavior. However, results suggest that patient-specific mechanical properties and detailed muscle modeling are required to provide accurate patient-specific numerical predictions of arterial displacement. Further adaptation of this model is expected to provide an improved ability to predict the multiaxial deformation of this arterial segment during leg movements and to optimize future stent designs.

N2 - The accelerated post-Covid expansion of online worlds presents an unprecedented move of people into real-time interactive digital spaces. What does this change mean for the future of geography as a discipline? At this critical juncture, there is potential to rethink the position of the digital in geographical thought and praxis – to move beyond apparently common-sense categorizations of real and virtual, representation and reality. This commentary considers the implications of the contemporary push toward ‘metaversal’ thinking for geographical theory as well as the significance of virtual world-making for geographical theorizations of digital space and place. I suggest that key thinkers on space and media geographies must be re-evaluated and applied to this new wave of digital development. What is the significance of recent debates around emerging spaces like the metaverse, augmented reality, and virtual reality, understood not as happenings with distinct real and virtual counterparts, but as geographical – spatial – phenomena?

N2 - Abstract Since ballistic and blast survivability and off-road handling and stability of military vehicles, such as the high-mobility multi-purpose wheeled vehicle (HMMWV), are two critical vehicle performance aspects, they both (including the delicate balance between them) have to be considered when a new vehicle is being designed or an existing vehicle retrofitted (e.g. up-armoured). Finite-element-based transient non-linear dynamics and multi-body longitudinal dynamics computational analyses were employed, relatively, in the present work to address the following two specific aspects of the performance of an HMMWV: first, the ability of the vehicle to survive detonation of a landmine shallow buried into sand underneath the right wheel of the vehicle and, second, the ability of the vehicle to withstand a simple straight-line brake manoeuvre during off-road travel without compromising its stability and safety of its occupants. Within the first analysis, the kinematic and structural responses (including large-scale rotation and deformation, buckling, plastic yielding, failure initiation, fracture, and fragmentation) of the HMMWV to the detonation of a landmine were analysed computationally using the general-purpose transient non-linear dynamics analysis software ABAQUS/Explicit. The second analysis was carried out using Simpack, a general-purpose multi-body dynamics program, and the main purpose of this analysis was to address the vehicle stability during the off-road travel. The same sand model was used in both types of analysis. Finally, the computational results obtained are compared with general field-test observations and data in order to judge the physical soundness and fidelity of the present approach.

N2 - An in vivo axial loading model of the rat ulna was developed almost two decades ago. As a minimally invasive model, it lends itself particularly well for the study of functional adaptation in bone and the interosseous membrane, a ligament spanning between the radius and ulna. The objective of this paper is to review computational and experimental approaches to elucidate its applicability for the study of multiscale bone and ligament mechanobiology. Specifically, this review describes approaches, including i) measurement of strains on bone tissue surfaces, ii) development of a three-dimensional finite element (FE) mesh of a skeletally mature rat ulna, iii) parametric study of the relative influence of mechanical constants and materials properties on computational model predictions, iv) comparison of experimental and computational strain distribution data, and analysis of the radius and interosseous membrane (IOM) ligament’s effect on axial load distribution through the ulna of the rat, and v) the effect of mechanical loading on transport through the IOM using different molecular weight fluorescent tagged dextrans. In the first stage of the study a computational stress analysis was performed after applying a 20 N single static load at the ulnar extremities, corresponding to values of experimental strain gauge measurements. To account for the anisotropy of the bone matrix, transverse isotraopic, elastic material properties were applied. In a parametric study, we analyzed the qualitative effect of different material properties on the global load and displacement behavior of the computational model. In a second stage, the same ulnar model used in the parametric study was extended to account for the interaction between the ulna, radius and IOM. The three-dimensional FE model of the rat forelimb confirms the influence of ulnar curvature on its deformation and underscores the influence of the radius and IOM on strain distribution through the ulna. The mode of strain, {i.e.} compression or tension, and strain distribution along the bone diaphysis correspond to those measured experimentally in vivo. When the radius and, indirectly, the IOM were loaded, the bone deformation shifted distally with respect to the diaphysis. In a final stage, the aforementioned ulnar model was used to study the permeability of fluorescent tagged dextrans with different molecular weights in the presence and absence of ulnar compression. Small molecular weight dextrans (3,000 Da) were distributed throughout the IOM in the absence of as well as after mechanical loading. Interestingly, no gradient in distribution was observed in either case. In contrast, very high molecular weight dextrans (1,000,000 Da) were observed only within vascular and lymphatic spaces in the bone (as well as periosteum) and IOM, both in the absence of and after the application of mechanical loading via end load compression. Between the two extremes, both 10 and 70 kDa tracers were distributed throughout the IOM after application of compressive loading. Loading appears to dissipate the steep gradient of fluorescent 70 kDa tracer observed along the lateral surface of the unloaded IOM and its insertion into the radius and ulna. Hence, this combined computational and experimental analysis of the ulna compression model provides new insight into multiscale mechanobiology of the ulna-radius-interosseous membrane construct and may provide new avenues for elucidation of ligament’s remarkable structure-function relationships.

N2 - Radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation treats cardiac diseases by inducing thermal lesion of cardiac tissues through radiofrequency energy operating at around 500 kHz. The electromagnetic wavelength is significantly longer than the size of the radiofrequency active electrode, the tissue is heated through resistive heating. During thermal ablation, the coupled thermo-mechanical property of cardiac tissue influencing the contact area between the electrode and tissue plays a crucial role in the formation of thermal lesions, yet the literature often overlooks the effect of thermal deformation. This paper proposes a thermo-hyperelastic constitutive model for myocardium that models thermal contraction and expansion during ablation. Furthermore, a finite element model was established to investigate the effect of the electro-thermo-mechanical coupling property of myocardium on lesion formation under different contact forces. To ensure convergence, we solved the fully coupled electro-thermo-mechanical finite element model using the segregated step method. The computational results demonstrate that thermal deformation, which causes an expansion in the tissue-electrode contact area, increases lesion width and volume, while its influence on lesion depth is negligible. Specifically, after a 30-s ablation under contact forces of 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 N, the lesion volume increased from 4.53, 7.66, and 10.62 mm3 (without thermo-mechanical coupling) to 5.36, 8.33, and 13.34 mm3 (with thermo-mechanical coupling), respectively. Similarly, the lesion width increased from 2.68, 3.12, and 3.44 mm to 2.78, 3.22, and 3.62 mm. Moreover, both thermal deformation and contact force exert a minimal effect on lesion formation time.

N2 - Flame stabilization distribution and efficient fuel mixing are highly significant in the performance of ramjet engine. In this paper, numerical studies are done to investigate the supersonic combustion of hydrogen and air co-flow in presence of the ramp edge. In this study, flame maintenance and combustion formation in a dual-combustion ramjet engine are fully investigated. The primary emphasis of this work is to disclose the impact of produced shocks due to the existence of ramp edge on the structure of fuel and air-jet immediately downstream of injector. The shock interactions of two different angles (10 deg and 30 deg) of the ramp edge are investigated. Favre-averaged conservation equations are considered for the simulation of compressible flows inside the combustor. Various mechanisms expressing the flame spreading characteristics are also examined. Depending on the angle of the ramp edge, the produced shock waves influence on size and strength of vortices. Our findings also show that high angles of ramp edge augment the fluctuation of the vortices by the splitter and consequently, fuel mixing enhances in the combustion chamber of ramjet engine. Our findings also confirm that the similar jet pressure would be more effective on the vortex production downstream of the splitter. The application of ramp edge with angle of 30 deg would increase average momentum thickness of the mixing layer up to 55%.

N2 - This paper presents a comprehensive investigation of a compression—ignition (CI) heavy-duty engine fuelled with diesel and gasoline-like fuels. A state-of-the-art engine computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tool was used to explore the influences of the physical and chemical properties of diesel and gasoline-like fuels (no. 91 gasoline and E10) on spray development, auto-ignition and combustion processes, and pollutant formation. The CFD simulation results were found to be consistent with available experimental measurements, both qualitatively and quantitatively. The results indicate that gasoline-like fuels are able to achieve better premixed charge in CI engines owing to their higher volatility and lower ignitability compared to diesel fuel, which promotes efficient, clean, and low temperature combustion. However, the high combustion pressure rise rate becomes problematic under some circumstances, especially for high octane number fuels, such as E10. Both previous experimental measurements and the present numerical results show that gasoline-like fuels have great potential to be used in future CI engines, but the injection strategies and injection system have to be optimized based on the fuel properties.

N2 - A comprehensive computational study, in both steady and unsteady flow conditions, has been carried out to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics of the Risø-B1-18 airfoil equipped with variable trailing edge geometry as produced by a hinged flap. The function of such flaps should be to decrease fatigue-inducing oscillations on the blades. The computations were conducted using a 2D incompressible RANS solver with a k-w turbulence model under the assumption of a fully developed turbulent flow. The investigations were conducted at a Reynolds number of Re = 1.6 · 106. Calculations conducted on the baseline airfoil showed excellent agreement with measurements on the same airfoil with the same specified conditions. Furthermore, a more widespread comparison with an advanced potential theory code is presented. The influence of various key parameters, such as flap shape, flap size and oscillating frequencies, was investigated so that an optimum design can be suggested for application with wind turbine blades. It is concluded that a moderately curved flap with flap chord to airfoil curve ratio between 0.05 and 0.10 would be an optimum choice.

N2 - Statistical modelling plays a central role for any prediction problem of interest. However, predictive models may give misleading results when the data contain outliers. In many real-world applications, it is important to identify and treat the outliers without direct elimination. To handle such issues, a hybrid computational method based on conic quadratic programming is introduced and employed on earthquake ground motion dataset. This method aims to minimize the impact of the outliers on regression estimators as well as handling the nonlinearity in the dataset. Results are compared against widely used parametric and nonparametric ground motion prediction models.
