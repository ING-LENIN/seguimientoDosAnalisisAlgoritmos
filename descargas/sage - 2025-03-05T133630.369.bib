N2 - This article presents a computational simulation framework developed to capture the ratcheting response of dented straight pipes. The results are compared against the results obtained from our previously conducted experiments. Ratcheting occurs when a structure is subjected to a primary axial load along with a secondary cyclic load, provided that the applied loads are sufficiently large in magnitude to cause the material to yield. The dented pipes investigated in this study were initially subjected to a monotonic axial compression load, which caused the initiation of small amplitude wrinkles, and were subsequently subjected to an axial cyclic loading regime. A nonlinear finite element analysis, using a combined hardening model, was adopted to model the response of the material during the entire loading regime. The parameters required by the material model were obtained from cyclic tests conducted on representative coupon specimens. The results of the numerical simulations were compared to experimentally obtained data. The results demonstrated that the ratcheting response of dented pipes could be numerically simulated with a reasonable accuracy. The results also revealed that the surface imperfections exerted a very pronounced effect on the ratcheting response of the dented pipes. The computational model was also used to investigate the influence of some key parameters, such as the initial strain level, stress amplitude, mean stress, loading regime, and material hardening properties, on the resulting ratcheting.

N2 - From their common roots in Human Factors Engineering, Human-Centered Design and Cognitive Systems Engineering have drifted into distinct fields over the past three decades, each developing beneficial heuristics, design patterns, and evaluation methods for designing for individuals and teams, respectively. GeoHAI, a clinical decision support application for preventing hospital-acquired infection, has yielded positive results in early usability testing and is expected to test positively in supporting joint activity, which will be measured through the novel implementation of Joint Activity Monitoring . The design and implementation of this application provide a demonstration of the possibilities and necessities to unify the work of Human-Centered Design and Cognitive Systems Engineering when designing technologies that are usable and useful to individuals engaged in joint activity with machine counterparts and other people. We are calling this unified process Joint Activity Design, which supports designing for machines to be good team players.

N2 - Genome-wide arrayed CRISPR screening is a powerful method for drug target identification as it enables exploration of the effect of individual gene perturbations using diverse highly multiplexed functional and phenotypic assays. Using high-content imaging, we can measure changes in biomarker expression, intracellular localization, and cell morphology. Here we present the computational pipeline we have developed to support the analysis and interpretation of arrayed CRISPR screens. This includes evaluating the quality of guide RNA libraries, performing image analysis, evaluating assay results quality, data processing, hit identification, ranking, visualization, and biological interpretation.

N2 - Motivated by the change of effective electrical properties grain or phase boundaries, a computational multiscale framework for continua with interfaces at the microscale is proposed. Cohesive-type interfaces are considered at the microscale, such that displacement and electrical potential jumps are accounted for. The governing equations for materials with interfaces under mechanical and electrical loads are provided. Based on these, a computational multiscale formulation is proposed. The coupling between the electrical and mechanical subproblem is established by the constitutive equations at the material interface. In order to investigate deformation-induced property changes at the microscale, the evolution of interface damage is elaborated. The proposed multiscale framework is further examined through various representative boundary value problems so as to identify its key properties.

N2 - A computational approach is used to find new solitary solutions of some nonlinear partial differential equations of higher order. The usual starting point is a special transformation converting the equation under consideration in its two variables x and t into a nonlinear ordinary differential equation in the single variable ξ. When we consider the method of hyperbolic functions, new distinctive classes of solutions of physical relevance result. The new feature of this paper is the fact that we are able to calculate distinctive classes of solitary solutions which cannot be found in the literature. In other words using this method the solution manifold is augmented by further classes of solution functions. Simultaneously we stress the necessity of such sophisticated methods since a general theory of nonlinear partial differential equations does not exist. Otherwise this paper is a natural completion of our recent results using alternative approaches for calculating soliton-like solutions.

N2 - An aim of human factors research is to have models that allow for the advance design of user-friendly environments. This is still a distant dream because existing models are not yet sufficiently sophisticated. Models in the domain of motor control are a case in point, but recent developments in computational motor control suggest that the gap between the current state of modeling in this area and the desired state is shrinking. To illustrate this point, we review principles of motor control research that any model of motor control must accommodate. Then we describe a model that captures many of the capacities of actors in the everyday world, including the capacity to reach for objects in different ways depending on factors such as the ease with which different joints can rotate, the required speed of movement, and whether obstacles are present. The model relies on the ideas that goal postures are internally specified before movements are generated, that tasks are defined with flexibly ordered constraint hierarchies, and that movements can be shaped according to task demands. Actual or potential applications of this research include designing and testing possible environments where motor components play a key role.

N2 - In this work we exploit a nonmonotonic Description Logic of typicality as a tool for the generation and the exploration of novel creative concepts. Our logic, called TCL, is able to deal with the phenomenon of prototypical concept combination, which has been shown to be problematic to be modelled in formalisms like fuzzy logic. The logic TCL is the result of combining three main ingredients: (i) the logic of typicality , that allows one to describe typical properties of a class by means of a typicality operator, (ii) the distributed semantics of probabilistic Description Logics, that allows one to provide a probability distribution over worlds/scenarios, and (iii) established heuristics used by humans for concept composition coming from the field of cognitive semantics. Our approach could be useful in many applicative scenarios, ranging from video games to the creation of new movie characters.

N2 - Replication is a critical element of the scientific process. This article is an effort to contribute to the slowly growing literature concerning the replication of agent-based computational models. We present a replication of Kollman, Miller, and Page’s model of Tiebout sorting. In that model, individual agents with heterogeneous preferences for government policies select among jurisdictions that offer the most satisfactory package of government services. This project makes three contributions to the literature. First, our successful replication provides the research community with a modernized version of that seminal model. Second, we confirm that earlier results with respect to the single jurisdiction setting are highly robust with respect to voter preferences, while the results for multiple jurisdiction settings are more sensitive. Finally, we demonstrate a technique for conducting sensitivity analyses that leverages a high-dimensional experimental design.

N2 - This study illuminates the varied emotional mechanisms underlying consumer response to ads paired with emotionally congruent versus incongruent content in different placement positions. This work expands the media planning literature that has narrowly focused on thematic (in)congruency. Focusing on music videos, Study 1 empirically tests the affect regulation effect on consumer response to ads paired with emotionally incongruent music videos and the affect priming effect in congruent pairings. Furthermore, this study incorporates affective computing algorithms to pair ads with music videos based on emotional (in)congruency to advance the emerging field of computational advertising. The results from two experimental studies demonstrate that consumers prefer the emotional flow from a negative to a positive state when the ad and media context are emotionally incongruent. In the emotional congruency condition, regardless of ad position, the positively valenced ad produces more favorable responses. Study 2 further illuminates the boundary conditions of emotional (in)congruency and ad valence, suggesting that consumers’ preference for positively valenced ads in the affect regulation and affect priming processes is more prominent when consumers are less involved. When involvement level is high, negative ads are rated as more persuasive than positive ones. Involvement level also reduces ad skipping, especially when the ad and the media program are emotionally incongruent.

N2 - The multiclass percentile user equilibrium (MCPUE) problem discussed in this paper assumes that travelers, subject to uncertainty in a transportation network, strive to minimize reserved travel time (also known as the travel time budget) to ensure a probability of arriving at their destinations on time. An MCPUE, defined as an extension of the Wardrop equilibrium in a probabilistic network, is achieved when no travelers, regardless of their preferred on-time arrival probability, can reduce their reserved travel time by unilaterally changing their routes. Efficient numerical procedures for computing the MCPUE are studied in this paper. Specifically, a proposed new gradient projection algorithm avoids path enumeration through a column generation procedure based on a reliable shortest path algorithm. Implementation details of inner iterations, which are critical to the overall efficiency of the algorithm, are also discussed. Numerical experiments are conducted to test the computational performance of the proposed algorithm.
