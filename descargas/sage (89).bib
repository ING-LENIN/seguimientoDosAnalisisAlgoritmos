N2 - Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) has been widely adopted to identify the Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the construction industry and determine its high environmental impact through Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, energy and resource consumptions. The consideration of LCA in the early stages of design is becoming increasingly important as a means to avoid costly changes at later stages of the project. However, typical LCA-based tools demand very detailed information about structural and material systems and thus become too laborious for designers in the conceptual stages, where such specifications are still loosely defined. In response, this paper presents a workflow for LCA-based evaluation where the selection of the construction system and material is kept open to compare the impacts of alternative design variants. We achieve this through a strict division into support and infill systems and a simplified visualization of a schematic floor layout using a shoebox approach, inspired from the energy modelling domain. The shoeboxes in our case are repeatable modules within a schematic floor plan layout, whose enclosures are defined by parametric 2D surfaces representing total ratios of permanent supports versus infill components. Thus, the assembly of modular surface enclosures simplifies the LCA evaluation process by avoiding the need to accurately specify the physical properties of each building component across the floor plan. The presented workflow facilitates the selection of alternative structural systems and materials for their comparison, and outputs the Global Warming Potential (GWP) in the form of an intuitive visualization output. The workflow for simplified evaluation is illustrated through a case study that compares the GWP for selected combinations of material choice and construction systems.

N2 - A method and a computational tool oriented to assist the damage and safety evaluation of buildings after strong earthquakes is described in this article. The input of the model is the subjective and incomplete information on the building state, obtained by inspectors which are possibly not expert professionals of the field of building safety. The damage levels of the structural components are usually described by linguistic qualifications which can be adequately processed by computational intelligence techniques based on neuro-fuzzy systems what facilitate the complex and urgent tasks of engineering decision-making on the building occupancy after a seismic disaster. The hybrid neuro-fuzzy system used is based on a special three-layer feedforward artificial neural network and fuzzy rule bases and is an effective tool during the emergency response phase providing decisions about safety, habitability, and reparability of the buildings. Examples of application of the computer program are given for two different building classes.

N2 - This article is set within a technological paradigm shift that denotes a transition from hardware to software and that, by means of applications and operating systems, plays a central role in the sociocultural sphere, intervening in the creation, classification and distribution of cultural objects. The aim of this research is to delve into how the graphical user interface (GUI) integrates into contemporary audiovisual discourse, focusing on its potential as a spatial metaphor. To that end, a theoretical framework is built on the concept of space as a tool and its instrumentalization in the GUI throughout the years, with a view to design a taxonomy in relation to the different ways in which the GUI integrates into digital image composition. The article concludes that the ability to operate in the virtual and physical space, moving between the logic of the tool and its potential as spatial metaphor, provides the GUI with the necessary specificity to be considered a key cultural element for analysing new media’s visual identity.

N2 - Purpose This study investigated the impact of the variant angulations on the values and distribution of wall shear stress on the renal branches and the mating vessels of a pivotal fenestrated design. Methods An idealized endograft model of two renal branches was computationally reconstructed with variable angulations of the left renal branch. These ranged from the 1:30’ to 3:30’ o’clock position, corresponding from 45° to 105° with increments of 15°. A fluid-structure-interaction analysis was performed to estimate the wall shear stress. Results The proximal part of the renal branch preserved quite constant wall shear stress. The transition zone between its distal end and the renal artery showed the highest values compared to the proximal and middle segments, ranging from 8.9 to 12.4 Pa. The lowest stress values presented at 90° whereas the highest at 45°. The post-mating arterial segment showed constantly low stress values regardless of the pivotal branch angle (6.3 to 6.6 Pa). The 45° configuration showed a distribution of the highest stress posteriorly whereas the 105°-angulation anteriorly. Conclusions The variant horizontal branch orientation influences the wall shear stress distribution across its length and affects its values only at its transition with the mating vessel. These findings and their potential association with adverse effects deserve further clinical validation.

N2 - Abstract The paper reviews experimental and computational research directed at improving the internal cooling of gas-turbine blades. While not the most glamorous area of gas-turbine aerothermodynamics, the improvements in overall thermal efficiency directly attributable to internal blade cooling arguably outstrip those achieved in any other area of jet-engine research. The cooling arrangements within a blade adopt three cooling strategies: impinging leading-edge jets, serpentine passages for the mid-blade section, and pin fins near the trailing edge. Progress in each of these areas is examined. Although, in the second of these areas, CFD studies have now become an essential weapon in the designer’s armoury, the other two still rely mostly on experimental research. Possible further developments are discussed.

N2 - A multi-objective optimization framework is developed for design of submarine hull shape. Internal volume of the vehicle and its hydrodynamic drag are optimized by seamlessly integrating non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm and Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes solver in a single code. The methodology seeks a geometric shape with minimum drag and maximum volume satisfying the constraints on the geometric design parameters given by a 5-parameter formula that describes the submarine hull. The shape of the sail is not a part of the optimization process, and only its longitudinal location over the submarine hull is optimized. Two design optimization approaches are proposed, solved and compared. In the first approach, the combined hull–sail location is optimized, and in the second, the hull shape without sail is optimized first, and for this optimized hull shape, the sail location is optimized next. Our reported results show that the former approach yields significantly lower drag.

N2 - In this paper, the authors investigate G-commerce—computational economies for controlling resource allocation in computational Grid settings. They define hypothetical resource consumers (representing users and Grid-aware applications) and resource producers (representing resource owners who “sell” their resources to the Grid). The authors then measure the efficiency of resource allocation under two different market conditions—commodities markets and auctions—and compare both market strategies in terms of price stability, market equilibrium, consumer efficiency, and producer efficiency. The results indicate that commodities markets are a better choice for controlling Grid resources than previously defined auction strategies.
