abstract = {This article proposes a methodological approach that integrates quantitative analysis into ethnographic studies of online communities. By considering traces of interactions in digital environments, it demonstrates the potential benefits of computational analysis in enhancing online ethnography. The application of quantitative methods, which may be unconventional in the field of ethnography, effectively complements qualitative understanding. Computational analysis of digital traces provides a valuable framework for observations within online ethnography. Through a case study of a Russian-speaking sociological online community, this article highlights the points where research questions intersect, fostering a dialogue between computational analysis of digital traces and online ethnography. It describes the implementation of methods such as content analysis, network analysis, and topic modeling, while also reflecting on their analytical capabilities within the context of online ethnography.}

abstract = {This article synthesizes a large body of research in the social and cognitive sciences to develop a distinctly cognitive understanding of political identity. Building on dual-process and computational theories of mind, the article defends three claims about the mental and behavioral implications of identity in political domains: (1) identity-based thinking is people’s default (often fast, automatic, and cognitively inaccessible) way of mentally representing politics and of drawing inferences based on those representations; (2) people are not limited to identity-based thinking and can sometimes learn to override it via slow, volitional, and conscious reasoning; and (3) the cognitive complexity of identity-based thinking is in-between the levels of mental sophistication that the Michigan and Rochester Schools in political science posit. This account of political identity illuminates, inter alia, why even low-information voters can quickly identify their political allies and opponents, why even high-information politicians can misperceive their constituents, why affective polarization has been increasing in the United States in recent decades, and why many normative theories of justice advise people to override identity-based thinking.}

abstract = {McShane et al.’s (2024) wide-ranging critique of null hypothesis significance testing provides a number of specific suggestions for improved practice in empirical research. This commentary amplifies several of these from the perspective of computational statistics—particularly nonparametrics, resampling/bootstrapping, and Bayesian methods—applied to common research problems. Throughout, the author emphasizes estimation (as opposed to testing) and uncertainty quantification through a comprehensive process of “curating” a variety of graphical and tabular evidence. Specifically, researchers should be encouraged to estimate the quantities that matter, with as few assumptions as possible, in multiple ways, then try to visualize it all, documenting their pathway from data to results for others to follow.}

abstract = {The development of a real-time driving simulator involves highly complex integrated and interdependent subsystems that require a large amount of computational time. When advanced hardware is unavailable for economic reasons, achieving real-time simulation is challenging, and thus delays are inevitable. Moreover, computational delays in the response of driving simulator subsystems reduce the fidelity of the simulation. In this paper, we propose a technique to decrease computational delays in a driving simulator. We used approximation techniques, sensitivity analysis, decomposition, and sampling techniques to develop a surrogate-based vehicle dynamic model (SBVDM). This global surrogate model can be used in place of the conventional vehicle dynamic model to reduce the computational burden while maintaining an acceptable accuracy. Our results showed that the surrogate model can significantly reduce computing costs compared to the computationally expensive conventional model. In addition, the response time of the SBVDM is nearly five times faster than the original simulation codes. Also, as a method to reduce hardware cost, the SBVDM was used and the results showed that most of the responses were accurate and acceptable in relation to longitudinal and lateral dynamics. Based on the results, the authors suggested that the proposed framework could be useful for developing low-cost vehicle simulation systems that require fast computational output.}

abstract = {Politics is an area that is traditionally believed to be gender divided. According to intergroup communication theory, this gender-salient context might cause differences in political communications between genders. Moreover, the internet and social media, which creates a computer-mediated interactive context, might also impact the traditional gender discrepancies in political discourse. This study used Twitter trace-data and computational text analysis to examine such suppositions. By analyzing over one million tweets, we found that compared to men, women generally had a stronger sense of group awareness and cohesion and showed a desire to promote their tweets while avoiding addressing other users in political discussions. Women also focused on family- and home-related issues more than men did. These findings suggest that Twitter is not an ideal public sphere where differences and inequalities are eliminated, but it might be a counter-public sphere that promotes the voices and increases the publicity of marginalized groups.}

abstract = {False positive findings are a growing problem in many research literatures. We argue that excessive false positives often stem from model uncertainty. There are many plausible ways of specifying a regression model, but researchers typically report only a few preferred estimates. This raises the concern that such research reveals only a small fraction of the possible results and may easily lead to nonrobust, false positive conclusions. It is often unclear how much the results are driven by model specification and how much the results would change if a different plausible model were used. Computational model robustness analysis addresses this challenge by estimating all possible models from a theoretically informed model space. We use large-scale random noise simulations to show (1) the problem of excess false positive errors under model uncertainty and (2) that computational robustness analysis can identify and eliminate false positives caused by model uncertainty. We also draw on a series of empirical applications to further illustrate issues of model uncertainty and estimate instability. Computational robustness analysis offers a method for relaxing modeling assumptions and improving the transparency of applied research.}

abstract = {This paper introduces a computational aesthetics framework utilizing computer vision (CV) and artificial neural networks (ANN) to predict the aesthetic preferences of groups of people for architecture. It relies on part-to-whole theories from aesthetics and cognitive psychology. A survey of a group of people on preferences of images is held to record an average hedonic response (AHR). CV algorithms MSER and SAM recognize parts in images. Birkhoff’s aesthetic measure formula is adapted by employing the number of parts and their connections. These quantities are used as input layers of an ANN, and the AHR is the target output. The ANN evaluates images to output a predicted hedonic response (PHR), which is tested as a criterion in parametric design space navigation and in mapping the latent space of GANs. We conclude that such a framework is a heuristic method for better understanding the design and latent spaces and exploring designs.}

abstract = {Metacognition supports reflection upon and control of other cognitive processes. Despite metacognition occupying a central role in human psychology, its neural substrates remain underdetermined, partly due to study-specific differences in task domain and type of metacognitive judgement under study.

Now that neuroimaging studies of metacognition are more prevalent, we have an opportunity to characterise consistencies in neural substrates identified across different analysis types and domains. Here we used quantitative activation likelihood estimation methods to synthesise findings from 47 neuroimaging studies on metacognition, divided into categories based on the target of metacognitive evaluation (memory and decision-making), analysis type (judgement-related activation, confidence-related activation, and predictors of metacognitive sensitivity), and, for metamemory judgements, temporal focus (prospective and retrospective). A domain-general network, including medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, precuneus, and insula was associated with the level of confidence in self-performance in both decision-making and memory tasks. We found preferential engagement of right anterior dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in metadecision experiments and bilateral parahippocampal cortex in metamemory experiments. Results on metacognitive sensitivity were inconclusive, likely due to fewer studies reporting this contrast. Finally, by comparing our results to meta-analyses of mentalising, we obtain evidence for common engagement of the ventromedial and anterior dorsomedial prefrontal cortex in both metacognition and mentalising, suggesting that these regions may support second-order representations for thinking about the thoughts of oneself and others.}
