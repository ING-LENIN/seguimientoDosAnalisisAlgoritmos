  abstract={The South African government continuously strives to work on the development of legislations that protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its citizen's information in the digital space. The contagion of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) led to a global lockdown that put governments in emergency mode. Post-COVID-19, the benefits of digitization became more noticeable. During the lockdown era cloud computing proved its effectiveness and efficiency in helping employees continue working even outside of their workstations. The objective of this paper is to scrutinize the current state of cloud data protection in the public sector within South Africa. The emphasis is placed on the draft National policy for cloud and data storage. This paper also makes recommendations to further strengthen and improve the current state of South Africa's cloud and data storage. It goes further to review existing legislations such as POPI, ECT, and cyber law acts and their relevance to the draft National Data and Cloud Policy. A proposal for a model that incorporates the cloud-shared responsibility model is presented and briefly discussed.},

  abstract={The challenges met during the software projects fall into any number of categories. The development and the technical solutions bring about technical challenges, but the situations one is confronted with, may also be sociological, psychological or managerial in nature. Without any knowledge in the field of social sciences, the programmers, testers and managers might interpret the social aspects of the project improperly, and such interpretations lead to the inability to fully understand the problem and, ultimately, to inefficiency in the decision-making process. Furthermore, solid knowledge of theories in the area of the social sciences is required for a better understanding of both the context in which the application runs and of the final users who will use the developed project. The understanding of and the involvement in a software acceptance testing (SAT) project, requires the combination of multiple theories and principles from different disciplines.},

  pages={630-634},
  abstract={Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention due to their impressive performance across various fields. Consequently, numerous researchers are exploring the potential of applying these models to graph problems. However, the effect of the temperature coefficient on graph reasoning within large models remains underexplored. To this end, we investigate the effect of temperature by using NLGraph as a benchmark. We aim to explore the effect of varying the temperature parameter in the discrete range of 0 to 1 on the models’ inference performance. The experimental results show that the LLMs’ sensitivity to temperature varies across tasks at different difficulty levels. In most cases, the accuracy is higher at moderate temperatures and lower at extreme temperature settings, suggesting that proper temperature tuning can improve inference performance. In addition, the effect of temperature change on accuracy is more significant in the shortest path problem. As the temperature increases, the tendency of the model to explore different solutions increases and the creativity and disorder of the response increases, leading to a decrease in accuracy and causing an increase in the rate of change.},

  pages={1-5},
  abstract={Aging may increase the number of failures that underground power distribution cables undergo. Recent works have investigated this problem and proposed repairable failure models that consider the effects of aging as well as of loading conditions. This paper examines and assesses the performances of two models; one of them is called IEC-Arrhenius-Weibull, because it combines the failure rate function of the Weibull distribution with the Arrhenius relationship and the standard IEC 60287-1-1. First, we analyze the modeling assumptions, the methods for incorporating loading conditions, and the approaches for calculating the model parameters. And second, we evaluate the performance of the two models through computer simulations, sensitivity analysis, and cable rankings. The results strongly suggest that the use of the Arrhenius relationship to calculate the scale parameter of the IEC-Arrhenius-Weibull model leads to provide reduced failure rates that may affect cable maintenance, and that this model significantly depends on its shape parameter to describe different degrees of aging. Thus, this paper helps stakeholders to identify a realistic model for underground cable management.},

  abstract={The use of wireless control systems for human-computer interaction has grown in popularity recently. Earlier, people used to stick to input tools like a keyboard or mouse, which restrict one’s movement and interaction options, but now, newer technologies like computer vision, machine learning and AI have opened new and interactive ways of interacting with computers. This paper presents a hand gestures approach that not only can control presentations but is also useful for facilitating drawing and managing system volume which enrich the user experience and engagement by offering an interface that eliminates the need for keyboard and mouse. With the help of this algorithm, the computer system accurately responds to hand movements in real time. With this model, one can easily navigate through slides, play, or pause videos, and perform multiple presentation related tasks using hand gestures. It boosts mobility and enhances audience engagement by removing the limitations posed by traditional input methods. It also allows users to digitally draw on the system. Users can sketch diagrams, annotate slides, and unleash their creativity without requiring drawing tablets. It uses Google’s mediapipe module to detect hand landmarks. We incorporated specific gestures that enable the model to initiate a particular action. It showed an accuracy of $\mathbf{9 8 \%}$ under normal lighting conditions, which slightly drops to $95 \%$ and $\mathbf{9 6 \%}$ in low and bright light, respectively, while the overall accuracy remains at $96.33 \%$.},

  abstract={Educational simulations can be useful for visualization of abstract and complex concepts and semiconductor physics seems ideal for this type of instructional support. The P-N diode is the most basic semiconductor device, but research has shown that its non-linear behavior poses problems to the students who struggle to explain its micro-scale behavior. Research in educational technologies for semiconductor materials and devices has shown improved learning with computer simulations. Freely available educational simulations that include the P-N junction show how the depletion width, the internal electric field, and band diagram changes with applied voltage. However, these diagrams are not directly used to visualize the different current components at the micro-scale. This work-in-progress paper discusses the initial design of an educational simulation of a P-N junction diode showing how the different current components vary dynamically with the applied voltage. The proposed simulation fills a void in the instructional materials related to the P-N diode by allowing students to visualize the impact that the applied voltage has on device current and determine its non-linear behavior.},

  abstract={Creating background music based on vocal sounds using deep learning is challenging. The task involves multiple input and multiple output cases that require lengthy input and output as data. However, training the models with raw data using low-end computers is expensive since training takes a long time and requires high memory. Previous studies predominantly have used Recurrent Neural Networks or Transformer models trained with the pitch, timing, and amplitude of scripted musical notes to generate new background music sequences. In this research, we proposed a novel training procedure using simple Gated Recurrent Units as the basic architecture of the model, which is trained with compacted high-dimensional vectors based on raw long audio sequences. Our experiments showed promising results, even when executed on low-end hardware. Our best model achieved a cumulative moving average of the loss of around 0.016, and the model successfully produced interesting background music based on vocal sound.},

  pages={S4G-S4G},
  abstract={The commonly used programming approach in teaching computer graphics requires students to learn a lot before they can generate basic and not-so-realistic images. As a result, students may easily be lost in the jungle of programming primitives, and their high expectation fades away quickly. Moreover, the API based programming approach does not support global illumination models. To address these problems, a new approach that combines ray tracing and programming has been used in a junior level elective course, Introduction to Computing with Geometry, with great success. With ray tracing, we are able to cover the camera metaphor, basic shapes, geometric modeling, coefficients of an illumination model, light sources, textures, surface tessellation, smooth and nonsmooth triangles, and algebraic surfaces. A student can learn all the basics and generate beautiful and realistic looking images easily and quickly. This paper details our approach and presents our course materials, exercises, student work and evaluation.},

Techniques like DALL.E2 and CLIP have shown significant success in producing high-quality images from descriptions. However, the challenge of achieving precise and creative image editing while preserving the original content persists. This study proposes a novel image editing method based on the Prompt-to-Prompt approach combined with large language models. The method aims to provide an intuitive and efficient editing experience, allowing users to perform detailed modifications without needing professional expertise in image processing. By leveraging advanced diffusion models, this approach enhances the flexibility of text-driven image editing, making it more accessible to a broader audience.},

  abstract={Forecasting model is a systematical tool to improve the performance of the demand forecasting in supply chain. With the incessant innovation of technology, new products have been developed continuously. Therefore, improving the forecasting accuracy of the new product has become a primary concern for many companies. Most of them in SCM care how to predict the new products sales in the future. Bass model was usually used to obtain the trend of the new product forecast by many reach in the past. Case-based Reasoning (CBR) is a method which can consider the past case to transform the useful historical experience into the case at present. To address this concern, we developed a demand forecasting methodology that combines CBR and common forecasting model. In the first stage, we use Bass model to obtain the new product sales forecasts. In the second stage, we obtain second forecast using CBR inference method to find the most similar curve in the past series. The final stage, we combine the forecast from Bass and CBR to development the hybrid forecast. Several cases are used to demonstrate the hybrid model how to improve the performance of new product forecast. The results show that the proposed hybrid model can effectively improve the accuracy of new product forecast.},

This paper proposes a generic model for designing learning experiences for CS curriculum. The model builds on existing credit systems such as European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS), to determine if a CS programme can be reshaped to a given period of time. Furthermore the model is capable of determining the student workload distribution across the different types of learning activities for a module. The distribution is computed based on information such as the number of credits for the module, the number of weeks in a semester, as well as the percentage hours of lectures, labs, independent study and other learning activities. Preliminary data collection and analysis was conducted in order to determine the percentages on 75 computer science modules taught at 14 universities from Ireland and UK.},

  abstract={There are a growing number of modeling techniques and algorithms for creating and modifying tree structures, both quickly and realistically. Many of these tools are part of larger software packages used for architecture or landscaping designs. In these tools the tree models are static and come from a library selection. In other areas, such as 3D modeling and design in film and animation, the tree creation tools are more open for artistic creativity and freedom of control. Much research has also been done on growing trees that are sensitive to some environment. That is, growing tree models where genus type, and natural and artificial environment factors are taken into heavy consideration. In this paper, we present an approach that facilitates user creativity while still providing a realistic response to environment factors. Our system adapts the Space Colonization Tree Modeling approach to allow for continued branch addition as well as environmental interaction. Feedback from experienced modelers who participated in a user study revealed that our approach generated the tree skeleton structures they intended and also provided realistic interaction with the environment.},

  abstract={In this study, we aimed to address issues related to students' slow writing skills by incorporating the “Out of Eden Walk” project using an AI model. Employing a project-based learning approach, our goal was to enhance students' writing abilities, particularly in the English subject. The research was conducted as a part of the classroom term-end assessment, following the model established by Nazarbayev Intellectual School of Chemistry and Biology, involving 42 students from Class 11. We utilized a qualitative descriptive method, employing both test and non-test instruments, including observation and data analysis in six cycles. The initial student completion rate was only 11.42%, while the experimental group showed a significant improvement to 85.71% by the end of the study. National Geographic's Out of Eden Walk, led by two-time Pulitzer Prize winner Paul Salopek, serves as an exemplary illustration of slow journalism. Over a seven-year, around-the-world journey, this article explores how Salopek's Walk not only embodies the essence of slow journalism but also significantly contributed to enhancing students' writing skills through the integration of an AI model.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={211-218},
  abstract={The ability to predict the performance of a simulation application before its implementation is an important factor for the adoption of parallel simulation technology in industry. Ideally, a simulationist estimates the inherent parallelism of a simulation problem to determine whether it is worthwhile to invest resources to carry out a parallel simulation. We propose an analytic method for predicting the simulation parallelism of a simulation problem that is independent of implementation details. We assume that the system to be simulated is modelled as a network of logical processes, and each logical process models a queuing server center. Unlike many analytic models reported in the literature, we consider the causal relations among events in a simulation. Causality effects reduce event parallelism. Our proposed analytic method gives a tighter upper bound on performance speedup. Validation experiments show that our analytic prediction of simulation parallelism differs from that of critical path analysis by 2.9% and 18.8% in open and closed systems respectively.},

  abstract={Multimodal emotion recognition aims to recognize emotions through modal features such as acoustic, text, and visual modalities. Although existing multimodal emotion recognition algorithms have achieved good performance, in many tasks, features are extracted from the same video for acoustic, text, and visual modalities, which will lead to redundant information across modalities. To alleviate this issue, this paper proposes a multidimensional orthogonal fusion module, which orthogonalizes the input feature vectors to obtain pairwise orthogonal vectors, and concatenates the base vectors with the obtained orthogonal vectors to form fusion vectors. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms mainstream multimodal emotion recognition algorithms. Ablation experiments show that the input sequence of modality affects the model's performance, with the model achieving optimal performance when the input sequence is visual features, speech features, text features, and personality features.},

The deaf user "speaks" by typing to a text-to-speech converter using a low-redundancy keyboard system.

The deaf user then tries to find a sensible path through the sentence lattice. Successful implementation of such a system, under development at SRI International, requires adequate performance in text generation speed by deaf users, text-to-speech intelligibility, and word-at-a-time speaking by hearing users, as well as large-vocabulary speech recognition and disambiguation of sentence lattices by deaf users.},

  abstract={Early childhood is a golden period for the development of a person’s learning ability, and educating children about objects in early childhood can cultivate their ability to recognize common things and objects in life. Early childhood object education can promote children’s ability to recognize and understand things. At present, there are common problems in kindergartens such as "difficulty in identifying objects" and "uninteresting in identifying objects". In this context, the article adopted a preschool object recognition education scheme based on FCOS (Fully Convolutional One-Stage Object Detection) algorithm, and achieved good results in practical teaching. The experimental results showed that the accuracy of the FCOS algorithm based method for early childhood object recognition education reached up to 95.1%. From this, it can be concluded that applying FCOS to early childhood object education enables young children to accurately recognize things around them in real life, improves their ability to recognize common things in life, and is beneficial for cultivating their observation and creativity, which has a positive effect on their growth.},

  abstract={With the continuous development of modern information technology, English learning methods and approaches are gradually diversified, especially the English electronic dictionary, which makes English learning easier. The quality of translation is an important criterion to measure the results of English interpret, which is mainly characterized by errors in translation characters or spelling, inconsistent expression, lexical and grammatical errors, etc. At present, the most advanced machine translation method, the so-called phrase-based model, is only limited to the mapping of small text blocks. Because language information is not explicitly used, it may be morphological, syntactic or semantic. This paper designs an English machine translation model based on modern intelligent recognition technology. Through the direct maximum entropy model, we can get the best combination of different features in complex English sentences, eliminate some structural ambiguities and improve the accuracy of English machine translation. Based on modern intelligent identification technology, this paper studies the development of English intelligent proofreading system, grasps the user's behavior data through behavior log, and optimizes the system. The software part of the system PP. adopts the computer intelligent proofreading method based on the improved phrase translation model to find the correct words to replace the words to be proofread and realize the intelligent proofreading of English interpret.},

  abstract={The demand for well-trained nursing professionals is ever-increasing, necessitating efficient placement processes post-graduation. This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict B.Sc. Nursing placement outcomes, aiming to optimize workforce management and graduate placement efficiency. Traditional placement methods often suffer from subjectivity and inefficiency. Leveraging historical placement data and relevant features, ML algorithms discern patterns to forecast individual placement likelihood accurately. Various ML techniques including logistic regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and ensemble methods are employed and evaluated for their predictive efficacy. The CN2 rule inducer model emerges as the top-performing model, demonstrating superior discriminatory ability and accuracy. These findings offer significant implications for nursing education institutions and healthcare organizations, facilitating better alignment of education with workforce demands. However, the study also emphasizes the importance of balancing model performance with interpretability. Further research and implementation efforts are warranted to refine predictive modeling approaches and seamlessly integrate them into nursing education and workforce management practices, ultimately contributing to the advancement of nursing practice and patient care delivery.},

The Hijazi heritage is full of unique art forms, including the Rawashin that adorn Hijazi buildings. With the remarkable technical progress of recent years, it has become necessary to highlight this identity in a contemporary way. This work aims to exploit and explore the capabilities of artificial intelligence techniques and GAN networks in creating and producing innovative new shapes with regard to Rawashin (wooden windows). The aim is to integrate such shapes with Arabic lettering in order to produce unprecedented designs in terms of Hijazi buildings. This is done by training the machine using a dataset consisting of images of different building shapes containing Rawashin and some Arabic calligraphy using two types of GAN models. As a result, the model was able to learn and produce a new style of Rawashin.},

In addition, the model is rendered by VARY Tenderer. Finally, the overall modeling effect is rendered by PS technology. Although this scheme is a widely chosen production process for producers, there are still unreasonable problems, including size, modeling sequence, modeling test and mapping efficiency. The second is the CASD software developed by the Chinese Academy of Architectural Sciences, which has the characteristics of super integration and precision, and is more efficient and practical than the previous production process.

  abstract={Online social networks (OSNs) have become so popular that it has changed the Internet to a more collaborative environment. Now, a third of the world's population participates in OSNs, forming communities, and producing and consuming media in different ways. The recent boom of artificial intelligence technologies provides new opportunities to help improve the processing and mining of social data. In this article, an algorithm that can detect communities in the OSNs using the concepts of granular computing in rough sets is proposed. In this information model, a social network as a rough set granular social network (RGSN) is modeled. A new community detection algorithm named granular-based community detection (GBCD) is implemented. This article also defines and uses two measures, namely, a granular community factor and an object community factor. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on four real-world data sets as well as computer-generated data sets. The model is compared with other state-of-the-art community detection algorithms for the values of modularity, normalized mutual information (NMI), Omega index, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and F1-measure. The cumulative performance of the GBCD algorithm is found to be 3.99, which outperforms other state-of-the-art community detection algorithms.},

  abstract={Computational chains which 'remember' that a computation has already been performed and its results are available for further use have been implemented using special classes of Matlab containers. A simple version management mechanism keeps track of any changes made to containers in the chain, and supports storage and retrieval of design data. Computational chains can be used as a basis for a more sophisticated version of management mechanism for maintaining a complete design-history database. Advantages of the computational chains become more apparent as the complexity of the work undertaken with them increases, so in this paper we describe quite a complex 'case study', which we think is a fairly typical of part of an industrial control system analysis. It is based on the use of a multivariable Smith predictor for a multivariable plant which contains time delays.},

  abstract={The objective of present research is comprehensive study related to 5G technology of mobile communication for year 2020 in Indian prospective. The European and American forums started thinking seriously about the next generation of wireless and mobile communication for 2020. A European forum named METIS, Mobile and wireless communications Enablers for the Twenty-twenty (2020). Information Society started working on funded project to identify the 5G future scenarios especially in European environment. METIS funded project also involves many leading technology companies. The guidelines decided by these projects will become basis of shape of fifth generation of wireless technologies. The 4G concept shave already moved to standardization phase, we must begin to work on the building blocks of the 5G networks.5G technology will provide low battery consumption, more secure features and 4A's paradigm ie any rate, anytime, anywhere and affordable. There is a need to study local scenarios and information technology related local demand to give a direction to 5G technology development. The future technology is required to be indigenous, capable to handle local social and economic issues so that use of Information technology may be able to address our issues more effectively. Presently, most of the Europe and USA may not be compared with India, China and third world. Better infrastructure, better economy and less population are some features of Europe and USA. There challenges are different and they develop technology for their growth. In most of the cases we adopt it large cost. Applying technologies in core and routed social aspect is big challenge for nation like India. As our technology and our needs and wants are different from front runners, we need to design the technology more judiciously and economically. We need a technology which enables poor person percentage to grow fast. In this view, we have indentified our own scenario and technological requirement to implement 5th generation of mobile and wireless technologies.},

  abstract={People nowadays cannot think of even a single moment without the internet. Doubtlessly, web applications are currently the key to all change in the world. The features and facilities of web applications make our lives easier and also demonstrate different channels of communication and exchange of data. The number of internet user is increasing day by day in Bangladesh. Web applications are not only encouraging internet users to easily receive diversified services, but also creating new opportunities in every business sector. With the help of web applications, businesses can easily enhance the quality of their services to consumers with minimal effort. However, at the same time, many threats have arisen as a result of the misuse of this technology. Cyber attacks could emerge as a major threat to the digital transformation of Bangladesh, given the vulnerability in web applications caused by careless coding during the development of such applications. During our review, we observed that the existence of Local File Inclusion (LFI) vulnerability in the web applications of Bangladesh was very critical. This paper explores in detail the harmful web application vulnerability attack, Local File Inclusion (LFI) based on Remote File Inclusion (RFI) as well as Structured Query Language Injection (SQLi), and their impact on the applications of Bangladesh.},

  abstract={Opinion mining is a technique by which we can find the semantic strength of reviews on an object using Fuzzy Inference System. Today people use information space to broadcast their opinions or views on any object or situation across the world. Analyses of these views yield a very useful information i.e. overall thinking about any object or situation. In this paper we have taken data from social networking site facebook on samsung mobile phones for analysis. After applying FIS on data collected we will give overall view on Samsung mobile phones across the virtual reality.},
