N2 - The analysis of fluid flow near the wellbore region of a hydrocarbon reservoir is a complex phenomenon. The pressure drop and flow rates change in the near wellbore with time, and the understanding of this system is important. Besides existing theoretical and experimental approaches, computational fluid dynamics studies can help understanding the nature of fluid flow from a reservoir into the wellbore. In this research, a near wellbore model using three-dimensional Navier–Stokes equations is presented for analyzing the flow around the wellbore. Pressure and velocity are coupled into a single system which is solved by an algebraic multigrid method for the optimal computational cost. The computational fluid dynamics model is verified against the analytical solution of the Darcy model for reservoir flow, as well as against the analytical solution of pressure diffusivity equation. The streamlines indicate that the flow is radially symmetric with respect to the vertical plane as expected. The present computational fluid dynamics investigation observes that the motion of reservoir fluid becomes nonlinear at the region of near wellbore. Moreover, this nonlinear behavior has an influence on the hydrocarbon recovery. The flow performance through wellbore is analyzed using the inflow performance relations curve for the steady-state and time-dependent solution. Finally, the investigation suggests that the Navier–Stokes equations along with a near-optimal solver provide an efficient computational fluid dynamics framework for analyzing fluid flow in a wellbore and its surrounding region.

N2 - Block-based programming languages (BBLs) have been proposed as a way to prepare students for learning to program in more sophisticated, text-based languages, such as Java. Hybrid BBLs add the ability to view and edit the block commands in auto-generated, text-based code. We compared the use of a non-hybrid BBL (Scratch), a hybrid BBL (Pencil Code), and no BBL across three sections of an introductory CS course that taught Java programming, to determine whether either type of BBL offered cognitive or affective advantages for learning Java. Students in the BBL groups were surveyed about their perceptions of each BBL in terms of ease of use and helpfulness in learning Java, and all three groups were compared on their performance in Java programming. The results showed that, in this introductory CS course, neither type of BBL offered an advantage in preparing students for learning Java. These results held regardless of the students’ level of Java knowledge prior to the course.

N2 - Inspired by the life cycle and survival of the fittest and combined with the consideration of living space information, a new computational intelligence approach, namely, living space evolution (LSE), is presented. LSE has reflected two new ideas. One is living space evolution: under the guidance of living space information, the offspring of life concentrate and evolve continuously towards richer living spaces. The other is multiple offspring reproduction: simulating real life in nature, a life can reproduce multiple offspring within one generation. In this work, LSE dynamic model, its flow, and pseudocodes are described in detail. A digital simulation has shown the procedure of LSE living space evolution. Furthermore, two applications of using LSE are employed to demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability. One is to apply it to the optimization for continuous functions, and the other is to use it as an optimization tool for routing protocol in wireless sensor network that is a discrete problem in real world. Research has shown that LSE is effective for the optimization for the continuous functions and also applicable for the discrete problem in real world. In addition, LSE has a special ability to balance search process from exploration to exploitation gradually.

N2 - The overflow energy loss in relief valve, which is one of the main reasons leading to the low efficiency of the hydraulic system, had been considered to be impossible to solve. The principle of the overflow energy loss of the relief valve is analyzed and a novel method to reduce the overflow loss using an energy recovery unit, which can improve the return line pressure of the pilot proportional relief valve, is proposed. The influence of the energy recovery unit on the pressure control characteristics and steady-state flow force of the pilot proportional relief valve are discussed. The effects of the return line pressure on the distribution of the flow field and the pressure control characteristics are analyzed through computational fluid dynamics simulation and experiment. The results show that with the increase of the return line pressure, the displacement of the main valve spool increases and the reset spring force increases accordingly. While the steady-state flow force decreases dramatically with the increase of the return line pressure, which results in a smaller pressure differential the pressure differential can be reduced from 15% to 2.5%. It is also observed that the flow rate of the pilot proportional relief valve can be maintained at a certain value with a small oscillation and that the pilot proportional relief valve can release the redundant flow of hydraulic system. This verifies that the pilot proportional relief valve with the outlet connecting to the energy recovery unit to recovery the overflow energy loss cannot reduce the pressure control characteristics, but can achieve a better pressure control accuracy of the pilot proportional relief valve.

N2 - The co-optimization of in-cylinder combustion and after-treatment technology has become a major aspect in engine design and development, with the goal of meeting the increasingly restrictive emission regulations in the transportation industry. Selective Catalytic Reduction is a robust technology to control the emission of NOx, and the injection of urea in water solution is the exhaust tailpipe is a key aspect of its operation. The proposed work uses high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics to characterize the atomization dynamics of the liquid jet in relevant cross-flow conditions. The study focuses on a commercial low-pressure (9 bar) pressure-swirl injector which is characterized in its internal geometry through high-resolution X-ray micro-computational tomography. The internal two-phase flow has been modeled according to the volume-of-fluid approach in a large eddy simulation framework and validated against near-nozzle X-ray radiography measurement. Moreover, characterizing the breakup dynamics for the swirling hollow cone formation, and assessing the influence of the cross-flow in the breakup dynamics was completed. The results have been reported proposing Re-Oh maps and probability density functions of the spray kinematics. Higher cross-flow momentum generates an increase in the jet intact length and a reduction of the liquid droplet diameters. The axial momentum of the jet is affected by the cross-flow already in the near-nozzle region, determining a relevant deviation of the spray velocities. This work aims to inform the initialization of Eulerian-Lagrangian spray models through the assignment of droplet kinematics and static one-way coupling between volume-of-fluid results and Lagrangian spray parcels, to be used for system-size domain simulations.

N2 - In a new theory of conflict escalation, Randall Collins engages critical issues of violent conflict and presents a compellingly plausible theoretical description based on his extensive empirical research. He also sets a new challenge for sociology: explaining the time dynamics of social interaction. However, despite heavy reliance on the quantitative concept of positive feedback loops in his theory, Collins presents no mathematical specification of the dynamic relationships among his variables. This article seeks to fill that gap by offering a computational model that can parsimoniously account for many features of Collins’s theory. My model uses perceptual control theory to create an agent-based computational model of the time dynamics of conflict. With greater conceptual clarity and more wide-ranging generalizability, my alternative model opens the door to further advances in theory development by revealing dynamic aspects of conflict escalation not found in Collins’s model.

N2 - This article reports five studies in which a scale for assessing teachers’ beliefs about classroom use of critical-thinking (CT) activities was developed and its scores evaluated for reliability and validity. The Critical Thinking Belief Appraisal (CTBA) is based on a four-factor “advantage effect” model: the theoretical premise that teachers’ CT-related decision making is associated with their beliefs about the effectiveness of (a) high-CT activities for high-advantage learners, (b) high-CT activities for low-advantage learners, (c) low-CT activities for high-advantage learners, and (d) low-CT activities for low-advantage learners. Results indicated that the scale produced scores with high reliability; a stable factor structure; and satisfactory discriminant, construct, and predictive validity. The studies supported the theoretical and practical utility of the construct and measure of teachers’ beliefs about classroom use of CT activities.
