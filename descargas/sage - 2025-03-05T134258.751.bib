N2 - The well-known glove box arrangement used in the nuclear industry maintains a pressure depression within a contaminated volume while allowing passage of a small purge flow to the filtration plant. Conventionally, if a glove tears for example, an electromechanical control system restores the depression by opening and regulating an extra connection to the filtration duct. However, faster response and lower maintenance overheads result from replacing the conventional system with the fluidic vortex amplifier (VA) but coupled ventilation system and VA dynamics can be unstable. Designers needed a tool to predict oscillatory performance and, ideally, to advise on the strengths of influence of network parameters on stability. A system modelling approach is presented in which pipework dynamics, including steady state friction, are presented by transmission line modelling (TLM). A semi-empirical feedback model of linearized VA dynamics has been developed and shown to be substantially correct. The model’s restriction to small signals does not adversely affect investigation of perturbation growth or decay. Partial transmission line representation of the VA model with special measures for feedback allowed time-domain simulations of network perturbations. However, this approach is indirect and it was possible to convert the whole VA model to transmission lines and then reformulate the TLM scheme into a direct, quantitative stability analysis. Extension of the technique provided a means of assessing the sensitivity of the stability to simple network alterations. The method has been programmed on an 80386 PC and successfully used on a large ventilation system. Success in the present context of dynamic stability for fluidic nuclear ventilation networks should be repeatable in other areas since the approach is applicable to any TLM-amenable system, be it fluid, mechanical, electrical or mixed.

N2 - In our systematic mapping study, we examined 289 published works to determine which intelligent computing methods (e.g. Artificial Neural Networks, Machine Learning, and Fuzzy Logic) used by air-conditioning systems can provide energy savings and improve thermal comfort. Our goal was to identify which methods have been used most in research on the topic, which methods of data collection have been employed, and which areas of research have been empirical in nature. We observed the rules for literature reviews in identifying published works on databases (e.g. the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers database, the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, and Wiley Online Library) and classified identified works by topic. After excluding works according to the predefined criteria, we reviewed selected works according to the research parameters motivating our study. Results reveal that energy savings is the most frequently examined topic and that intelligent computing methods can be used to provide better indoor environments for occupants, with energy savings of up to 50%. The most common intelligent method used has been artificial neural networks, while sensors have been the tools most used to collect data, followed by searches of databases of experiments, simulations, and surveys accessed to validate the accuracy of findings.

N2 - It has been noted by many researchers that young bilingual children pass through a stage of early mixing which extends approximately until the age of 2;6 and ends abruptly. Research on bilingual first language acquisition has clearly excluded the possibility to explain mixed utterances as the result of a fused lexical or grammatical system. However, the actual debate on the reasons for early mixing still continues. Two main approaches have dominated the field of language mixing in adults: One assumes that adult’s codeswitching is constrained by grammatical principles, suggesting that a third grammar is responsible for the grammaticality of mixed utterances (e.g., the Equivalence Constraint formulated by Poplack (1980), or the Functional Head Constraint formulated by Belazi, Rubin & Toribio (1994) among others). Since child grammar is supposed to be organized differently from adult grammar, the grammatical “ingredients” of the principles which constrain codeswitching are absent in early child language (Köppe & Meisel, 1995). It therefore follows that early mixing in young bilingual children is not to be considered as constrained by any grammatical principles. The other approach argues that codeswitching in adults is not regulated by external grammatical principles, but that the only constraints which govern codeswitching are those required by the two languages involved (MacSwan, 2000). We will show that this assumption holds for child language as well. Our analysis of mixing opens the perspective that child grammar can be considered to be organized in the same way as adult grammar. Furthermore, we will argue that early mixing is related to developing performance abilities, in the present paper to the readiness on the bilingual child’s part to speak the language(s).

N2 - Psychological experiments on children’s development of spatial knowledge suggest that experience at self-locomotion and visual tracking are important factors. Yet, the mechanism underlying development is unknown. We propose a robot that learns to track a target object mentally (i.e., maintaining a representation of an object’s position when outside the field of view) as a model for spatial development. Mental tracking is considered as prediction of an object’s position, given the previous environmental state and motor commands and the current environment state resulting from movement. Following Jordan and Rumelhart’s (1992) forward modeling architecture, the system consists of two components: an inverse model of sensory input to desired motor commands and a forward model of motor commands to desired sensory input (goals). The robot was tested on the “three cups”paradigm (in which children are required, under various movement conditions, to select the cup containing the hidden object). Consistent with child development, in the absence of the capacity for self-locomotion, the robot makes errors that are self-center-based. When given the ability for self-locomotion, the robot responds allocentrically.

N2 - In an effort to infuse problem-solving activities requiring higher-order thinking into inner-city classrooms, we investigated the use of microcomputers with a graphing application program to teach principles of the design and interpretation of graphs to a population of students with little or no prior knowledge of graphs or data analysis. This is an exploratory, naturalistic research study of students’ thoughts and behavior in this context. It differs from most earlier work in the field of computer-assisted graphing in three major ways: first, we focus broadly on a wide variety of types of graphs, used in several different subject matter contexts; second, we conduct research into problem solving processes in an unmodified whole-classroom environment; third, we supplement participant observations on student cognition with extensive behavioral sequence data gathered automatically and unobtrusively by the computer. We detail our attempts to develop, adapt, and apply quantitative methods of analysis of behavioral sequences which are potentially applicable to such data gathered for a large number of students.

N2 - This paper describes a Group Decision Support System for cooperative or non‐cooperative argumentative discourses. The system provides agents means of expressing and weighing their individual arguments and preferences, in order to argue for or against the selection of a certain choice. It supports defeasible and qualitative reasoning in the presence of ill‐structured information. Argumentation is performed through a set of discourse acts which call a variety of procedures for the propagation of information in the corresponding discussion graph. The system incorporates Case Based Reasoning to resolve current issues by using previous similar situations. Cases are not mere representations of past data, but flexible entities associated with the underlying viewpoint of an agent and the evolution of the corresponding discussion. The paper provides an object‐oriented description of the elements involved, and illustrates their dependencies through a comprehensive example.

N2 - The Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT) is the most widely used norm-referenced creativity test used in gifted identification. Although commonly used for identifying talent, little is known about how creativity tests, like the TTCT-Figural, contribute to the probability of being identified as gifted especially with underrepresented populations. Using nominated students (n = 1,191) from a diverse midsized urban school district, this study examined the differential predictive validity among student demographics (i.e., race/ethnicity, free/reduced price lunch status, English learning status, sex) and the TTCT-Figural to the probability of being identified as gifted. Results of a multilevel hierarchical generalized linear regression indicated underrepresented groups showed no difference in the probability of being identified after controlling for cognitive ability and academic achievement; the same was true when the TTCT-Figural was included within the model. The inclusion of the TTCT-Figural does contribute to the probability of identification; however, the disproportionality of underrepresented student groups remains in this school district. Gifted administrators looking to enhance equity may not find the solution with the mere inclusion of a creativity assessment. Implications for practice and future directions are discussed.

N2 - Concrete in transportation infrastructure is constantly subjected to the ingress of chloride, which could cause reinforcement corrosion and significant deterioration of concrete structures if not well controlled. Major types of reinforcement corrosion, such as pitting corrosion and concentration-cell corrosion, are usually initiated with localized chloride concentrations whose behavior is closely related to the transport characteristics of chloride ions in hydrated cement paste. However, unless studied at the molecular level, chloride transport behavior cannot be properly understood and controlled in view of the high heterogeneity of cement paste. The findings are presented from a research study recently conducted with a molecular dynamics (MD) approach to investigate the physicochemical nature of the various interactions between chloride ions and cement hydration products, which might significantly influence chloride transport in cement paste. Six hydrated compounds including portlandite, C-S-H phases (tobermorite and jennite), AFm phases (hydrocalumite and kuzelite), and the AFt phase (ettringite) were modeled and then validated by using the 35Cl nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy technique. On the basis of the MD-generated ionic trajectory, the macroscopic transport phenomenon of chloride species was evaluated in the vicinity of each different hydration product in terms of a computed effective diffusion coefficient.

N2 - A framework for thinking about teacher empowerment is presented. Two important dimensions are used as a basis for highlighting some important similarities and differences emerging in the literature on empowerment. The first relates to the context in which the process occurs; some educators highlight the importance of the personal context (i.e., conversations with self), while others assume more of an outward perspective in their thinking about empowerment (i.e., conversations with settings). The second important dimension relates to the focus or agenda of the conversations. Here, a distinction is made between agendas that are more epistemological in nature and those that are more political. An illustration is provided of how this framework can be used to better understand the dynamics involved in collaborative work with teachers.
