N2 - The increasing availability of data, along with sophisticated computational methods for analyzing them, presents researchers with new opportunities and challenges. In this article, we address both by describing computational and network methods that can be used to identify cases of rare phenomena. We evaluate each method’s relative utility in the identification of a specific rare phenomenon of interest to social movement researchers: the spillover of social movement claims from one movement to another. We identify and test five different approaches to detecting cases of spillover in the largest data set of protest events currently available, finding that an ensemble approach that combines clique and correspondence analysis and an ensemble approach combining all methods perform considerably better than others. Our approach is preferable to other ways of analyzing such cases; compared to qualitative approaches, our computational process identifies many more cases of spillover—some of which are surprising and would likely not be otherwise investigated. At the same time, compared to crude quantitative measures, our approach substantially reduces the “noise,” or identification of false-positive cases, of movement spillover. We argue that this technique, which can be adapted to other research topics, is a good illustration of how the thoughtful implementation of computational methods can allow for the efficient identification of rare events and also bridge deductive and inductive approaches to scientific inquiry.

N2 - In this short note we present an elementary matrix-constructive algorithmic proof of the Quillen-Suslin theorem for Ore extensions A := K[x; σ, δ], where K is a division ring, σ : K → K is a division ring automorphism and σ : K → K is a σ-derivation of K. It asserts that every finitely generated projective A-module is free. We construct a symbolic algorithm that computes the basis of a given finitely generated projective A-module. The algorithm is implemented in a computational package. Its efficiency is illustrated by four representative examples.

N2 - Knowledge and skill in multiplication were investigated for late elementary-grade students with mathematics learning disabilities (MLD), typically achieving age-matched peers, low-achieving age-matched peers, and ability-matched peers by examining multiple measures of computational skill, working memory, and conceptual knowledge. Poor multiplication fact mastery and calculation fluency and general working memory discriminated children with MLD from typically achieving age-matched peers. Furthermore, children with MLD were slower in executing backup procedures than typically achieving age-matched peers. The performance of children with MLD on multiple measures of multiplication skill and knowledge was most similar to that of ability-matched younger children. MLD may be due to difficulties in computational skills and working memory. Implications for the diagnosis and remediation of MLD are discussed.

N2 - We present an implementation of DIANA, a computational model of spoken word recognition, to model responses collected in the Massive Auditory Lexical Decision (MALD) project. DIANA is an end-to-end model, including an activation and decision component that takes the acoustic signal as input, activates internal word representations, and outputs lexicality judgments and estimated response latencies. Simulation 1 presents the process of creating acoustic models required by DIANA to analyze novel speech input. Simulation 2 investigates DIANA’s performance in determining whether the input signal is a word present in the lexicon or a pseudoword. In Simulation 3, we generate estimates of response latency and correlate them with general tendencies in participant responses in MALD data. We find that DIANA performs fairly well in free word recognition and lexical decision. However, the current approach for estimating response latency provides estimates opposite to those found in behavioral data. We discuss these findings and offer suggestions as to what a contemporary model of spoken word recognition should be able to do.

N2 - The current criterion for surgical intervention in abdominal aortic aneurysms, based upon a maximal aortic diameter, is considered conservative due to the high mortality rate in case of rupture. The research community is actively investigating the use of computational mechanics tools combined with patient-specific imaging to help identify more accurate criteria. Widespread uptake of a successful metric will however be limited by the need for computed tomography, which is at present the primary image extraction method on account of the location and complex shape of the aneurysms. The use of three-dimensional ultrasound as the scanning method is more attractive on account of increased availability, reduced cost and reduced risk to patients. The suitability of three-dimensional ultrasound is assessed for this purpose in the present work; computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed on geometries obtained from the same patient using both ultrasound and computed tomography. The influence of different smoothing algorithms is investigated in the geometry preparation stage and Taubin’s low-pass filter was found to best preserve geometry features. Laminar, Newtonian, steady-state simulation analysis identified haemodynamic characteristics to be qualitatively similar in terms of wall shear stress, velocity and vorticity. The study demonstrates the potential for three-dimensional ultrasound to be integrated into a more accessible patient-specific modelling tool able to identify the need for surgical intervention of abdominal aortic aneurysms.

N2 - The information processing approach traditionally has been the theoretical foundation of mental workload. Computational neurocognitive models are emerging approaches to understanding how the brain performs cognitive functions. Computational complexity refers to the many possibilities and ambiguities intrinsic in the environmental stimuli. These models agree that the brain has limited computational power. Utility and implications of the computational approaches to the understanding of mental workload, especially that of higher-level activities such as strategic control of dynamic multiple-task performance and situation awareness will be explored.

N2 - BACKGROUND: Systemic-to-pulmonary shunt is a palliative procedure used to decrease pulmonary blood flow in congenital heart diseases. Shunt stenosis or occlusion has been reported to be associated with mortality; therefore, the management of thrombotic complications remains a challenge for most congenital cardiovascular surgeons. Despite its importance, the optimal method for shunt anastomosis remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: The study investigates the clinical benefits of the punch-out technique over conventional methods in the anastomosis process of Systemic-to-pulmonary shunt, focusing on its potential to reduce shunt-related complications. METHODS: Anastomotic models were created by two different surgeons employing both traditional slit and innovative punch-out techniques. Computational tomography was performed to construct three-dimensional models for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. We assessed the flow pattern, helicity, magnitude of wall shear stress, and its gradient. RESULTS: The anastomotic flow area was larger in the model using the punch-out technique than in the slit model. In CFD simulation, we found that using the punch-out technique decreases the likelihood of establishing a high wall shear stress distribution around the anastomosis line in the model. CONCLUSION: The punch-out technique emerges as a promising method in SPS anastomosis, offering a reproducible and less skill-dependent alternative that potentially diminishes the risk of shunt occlusion, thereby enhancing patient outcomes.
