N2 - Numerical techniques for the calculation of velocity and temperature distributions in heated ducts have proved accurate but expensive in computer time and capacity. It is worth investigating to what extent simplification is possible without loss of accuracy. Entry-length heat transfer to upward laminar flow with combined convection in a vertical tube is taken as typical. Comparison is made between measured values and, first, a full numerical solution for constant thermophysical properties (viscosity and thermal diffusivity), secondly, the same solution but allowing for their individual and combined variation with temperature and, thirdly, a solution which assumes a series of truncated versions of the fully developed temperature distribution to establish corresponding velocity profiles, allowing for temperature-dependent properties.

N2 - Abstract The parameter identification of magnetorheological dampers by an inverse method is proposed. A modified Bouc-Wen modified dynamic model is considered and its parameters are obtained by using genetic algorithms. The experimental data consist of time histories of current, displacement, velocity, and force measured for both constant and variable current. The model parameters are determined using a set of experimental measurements corresponding to different constant current values and the resulting model is validated on the data measured for variable current. Based on this model a semi-active control of vehicle suspension is studied and a fuzzy controller is developed to reduce the chattering effect.

N2 - The nonlinear behavior of a high-temperature metal-matrix composite (HT-MMC) was simulated by using the METCAN (Metal Matrix Composite Analyzer) computer code. The simulation started with the fabrication process, proceeded to thermo mechanical cyclic loading, and ended with the application of a monotonic load. Classical laminate theory and composite micromechanics and macromechanics are used in MET CAN, along with a multifactor interaction model for the constituents’ behavior. The simu lation of the stress-strain behavior from the macromechanical and the micromechanical points of view, as well as the initiation and final failure of the constituents and the plies in the composite, was examined in detail. It was shown that, when the fibers and the matrix were perfectly bonded, the fracture started in the matrix and then propagated with increas ing load to the fibers. After the fibers fractured, the composite lost its capacity to carry ad ditional load and fractured.

N2 - Effect sizes are critical to result interpretation and synthesis across studies. Although statistical significance testing has historically dominated the determination of result importance, modern views emphasize the role of effect sizes and confidence intervals. This article accessibly discusses how to calculate and interpret the effect sizes that counseling psychologists use most frequently. To provide context, the author presents a brief history of statistical significance tests. Second, the author discusses the difference between statistical, practical, and clinical significance. Third, the author reviews and graphically demonstrates two common types of effect sizes, commenting on multivariate and corrected effect sizes. Fourth, the author emphasizes meta-analytic thinking and the potential role of confidence intervals around effect sizes. Finally, the author gives a hypothetical example of how to report and potentially interpret some effect sizes.

N2 - This article is concerned with the electromechanically coupled multiscale behaviors of the heterogeneous piezoelectric materials, which consist of periodic or non-periodic distributed microstructures. A multiscale framework based on the extended multiscale finite element method is developed to capture the large-scale solutions on the coarse-scale mesh without resolving the entire small-scale features. In this method, the microscale fluctuations in the mechanical displacement and electrical potential are related to the macroscopic deformation and electrical fields through the multiscale base functions. To improve the accuracy of the multiscale method, the periodic boundary conditions are developed to calculate the multiscale base functions for those piezoelectric structures composed of periodic microstructures. Moreover, the oversampling techniques are introduced to derive the oscillatory boundary conditions to construct the base functions for those piezoelectric structures with non-periodic heterogeneous microscopic features. The efficiency and accuracy of the multiscale method proposed for the piezoelectric materials are validated through the examples where the structures consist of periodic or non-periodic heterogeneous microstructures. The results indicate that the multiscale method developed can effectively obtain the macroscale response of piezoelectric materials (displacement or electrical potential) as well as the response in the microscale (stress or electrical displacement).

N2 - This paper describes an effort to model and predict astronaut performance during sudden workload transitions in long duration missions. Our approach to the work is heavily based on empirical research. We have performed a set of meta-analyses 1) to identify the quantitative effects of poor sleep on task accuracy and task completion time, and 2) to develop a model of operator task selection during multitasking. We are currently developing a model, based on a literature review, to predict the effects of automation design factors on operator task performance. This paper gives an overview of the project, presents the overall model of operator performance during a workload transition, and describes the empirical and theoretical underpinnings of a model that predicts the effects of automation design on operator performance.
