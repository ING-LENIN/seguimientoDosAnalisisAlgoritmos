abstract = {Accountability is often seen as a key notion in distributed systems, both in the human world and in software, on top of which interaction is built, together with the sibling notion of responsibility. However, there is limited support for the specification and use of such concepts in computational settings. This paper proposes an information model for computational accountability, which describes what data have to be available to allow, in any situation of interest arising from a group of interacting parties, the investigation and identification of accountability. The characterization of accountability provided by the model is grounded in the notions of just expectation and control. The information model is expressed in Object-Role Modeling (ORM), since it is well-suited to capture the relational nature of the accountability concept. An advantage of our model is that a designer can verify the consistency of a domain w.r.t. a set of accountability requirements. The paper exemplifies this checking by means of an Answer Set Program (ASP).}

abstract = {The discipline of computational fluid dynamics is de manding ever-increasing computational power to deal with complex fluid flow problems. We investigate the performance of a finite-difference computational fluid dynamics algorithm on a massively parallel computer, the Connection Machine. Of special interest is an implicit time-stepping algorithm; to obtain maximum perfor mance from the Connection Machine, it is necessary to use a nonstandard algorithm to solve the linear systems that arise in the implicit algorithm. We find that the Connection Machine can achieve very high computation rates on both explicit and implicit algorithms. The per formance of the Connection Machine puts it in the same class as today’s most powerful conventional supercomputers.}

abstract = {A detailed understanding of the air–fuel mixing process in gasoline direct injection engines is necessary to avoid soot formation that might result from charge inhomogeneities or liquid fuel impingement on the cylinder walls. Within this context, the use of multidimensional models might be helpful to better understand how spray evolution in cylinder charge motions and combustion chamber design affects the mixture quality at spark-timing. In this work, the authors developed and applied a computational fluid dynamics methodology to simulate gas exchange and air–fuel mixture formation in gasoline direct injection engines. To this end, a suitable set of spray submodels was implemented into an open-source code to properly describe the evolution of gasoline jets emerging from multihole atomizers. Furthermore, the complete liquid film dynamics was also considered. For a proper assessment of the approach, a gasoline direct injection engine running at full load was simulated and effects of spray targeting and engine speed were studied. A detailed postprocessing of the computed data of liquid film mass, homogeneity index and equivalence ratio distributions was performed and correlated with experimental data of particulate emissions. Satisfactory results were achieved, proving the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in predicting the effects of injection system and operating conditions on soot formation.}

abstract = {This review focuses on the modeling of articular cartilage (at the tissue level), chondrocyte mechanobiology (at the cell level) and a combination of both in a multiscale computation scheme. The primary objective is to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of conventional models implemented to study the mechanics of the articular cartilage tissue and chondrocytes. From monophasic material models as the simplest form to more complicated multiscale theories, these approaches have been frequently used to model articular cartilage and have contributed significantly to modeling joint mechanics, addressing and resolving numerous issues regarding cartilage mechanics and function. It should be noted that attentiveness is important when using different modeling approaches, as the choice of the model limits the applications available. In this review, we discuss the conventional models applicable to some of the mechanical aspects of articular cartilage such as lubrication, swelling pressure and chondrocyte mechanics and address some of the issues associated with the current modeling approaches. We then suggest future pathways for a more realistic modeling strategy as applied for the simulation of the mechanics of the cartilage tissue using multiscale and parallelized finite element method.}

abstract = {In recent years, the use of machine learning-based surrogate models for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations has emerged as a promising technique for reducing the computational cost associated with engine design optimization. However, such methods still suffer from drawbacks. One main disadvantage is that the default machine learning (ML) hyperparameters are often severely suboptimal for a given problem. This has often been addressed by manually trying out different hyperparameter settings, but this solution is ineffective in case of a high-dimensional hyperparameter space. Besides this problem, the amount of data needed for training is also not known a priori. In response to these issues that need to be addressed, the present work describes and validates an automated active learning approach, AutoML-GA, for surrogate-based optimization of internal combustion engines. In this approach, a Bayesian optimization technique is used to find the best machine learning hyperparameters based on an initial dataset obtained from a small number of CFD simulations. Subsequently, a genetic algorithm is employed to locate the design optimum on the ML surrogate surface. In the vicinity of the design optimum, the solution is refined by repeatedly running CFD simulations at the projected optima and adding the newly obtained data to the training dataset. It is demonstrated that AutoML-GA leads to a better optimum with a lower number of CFD simulations, compared to the use of default hyperparameters. The proposed framework offers the advantage of being a more hands-off approach that can be readily utilized by researchers and engineers in industry who do not have extensive machine learning expertise.}

abstract = {In-cylinder water injection is a promising approach for reducing NOx and soot emissions from internal combustion engines. It allows one to use a higher compression ratio by reducing engine knock; hence, higher fuel economy and power output can be achieved. However, water injection can also affect engine combustion and emission characteristics if water injection and injector parameters are not properly set. Majority of the previous studies on the water injection are done through experiments. Therefore, subtle aspects of water injection such as in-cylinder interaction of water sprays, spatial distribution of water vapor, and effect on flame propagation are not clearly understood and rarely reported in literature due to experimental limitations. Thus, in the present article, a computational fluid dynamics investigation is carried out to analyze the effects of direct water injection under various injector configurations on water evaporation, combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of a gasoline direct injection engine. The emphasis is given to analyze in-cylinder water spray interactions, flame propagation, water spray droplet size distribution, and water vapor spatial distribution inside the engine cylinder. For the study, the water-to-fuel ratio is varied from 0 to 1. Various water injector configurations using nozzle hole diameters of 0.14, 0.179, and 0.205 mm, along with nozzle holes of 4, 5, 6, and 7, are considered for comparison in addition to the case of no_water. Computational fluid dynamics models used in this study are validated with the available data in literature. From the results, it is found that the emission and performance characteristics of the engine are highly dependent on water evaporation characteristics. Also, the water-to-fuel ratio of 0.6 with 6 number of nozzle holes and the nozzle diameter of 0.14 mm results in the highest indicated mean effective pressure and the lowest NOx, soot, and CO emissions compared to other cases considered.}

abstract = {A method for computational description of morphology of dispersive components’ spatial structures in composites has been developed. The method is based on the calculation and comparison average values of the elongation coefficient (Ke), sinuosity coefficient (Ks), and fullness coefficient (Kf) for structures of the dispersed phase. Stationary systems such as composite oligodiene epoxide vulcanizate (PDI 3AK) as matrix with micro-dispersive aluminium powder and composite methyl methacrylate-styrene (PMMAS) as matrix with magnetite Fe3O4 nanoparticles were investigated by SEM and AFM, respectively. Time behavior of micro-dispersive carbon black in dynamic system comprised of polydivinylisoprene oligomer (PDI) as the matrix was studied by optical microscopy. The obtained results by method for computational description of morphology had showed universality of the method and enabled ascertaining quantitative correlations describing shapes of certain particles of the filler and morphology of spatial structure under formation. Dependence of form coefficients on the time was determined. This dependence enables studying kinetics of structure formation.}

abstract = {Hybrid porous tilting pad bearings with the advantages of gas porous bearings and tilting pad bearings exhibited excellent rotor-supporting performance with high accuracy and stability. Under hybrid lubrication, the transient adaptive motion of the tilting pads was important for the rotordynamic characteristics. A novel fluid–structure interaction model of hybrid porous tilting pad bearings was developed to investigate the transient hydro forces and the pad’s adaptive motion. The rotordynamic coefficients of the hybrid porous tilting pad bearings were identified using the rotor harmonic trajectory. The computational fluid dynamics-fluid–structure interaction model was validated with the experimental data. The effects of eccentricity ratios, rotor speeds, supply pressures, pivot radial stiffnesses, and dampings on the pad adaptive motion and the rotordynamic coefficients were evaluated. The pad self-adaption motions significantly influenced the supporting and vibration-absorbing characteristics of hybrid porous tilting pad bearings.}

The productivity of a computer user is directly related to this turnaround time. In a time-sharing environment, such improvement in this speed is achieved when multiple processors are used efficiently to execute an algorithm. We apply the concept of mul tiple instructions and multiple data (MIMD) through multitasking via a strategy that requires relatively minor modifications to an existing code for a single processor. This approach maps the available memory to multiple processors, exploiting the C-Fortran-Unix interface. The existing code is mapped without the need for devel oping a new algorithm. The procedure for building a code utilizing this approach is automated with the Unix stream editor.}
