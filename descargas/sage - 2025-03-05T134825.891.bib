abstract = {Edith Ackermann was one of the most important scholars in the interdisciplinary field of Child-Computer Interaction. Trained as a developmental psychologist and having worked with Jean Piaget in Switzerland, Ackermann went to MIT in 1985 to join an intrepid group of researchers led by Seymour Papert who were trying to understand how extant theories of development and learning would fare in a world in which children would be surrounded by computational artefacts. For the ensuing three decades, Ackermann would use her unique interdisciplinary expertise in the service of creating new theories of development for this new world, generating cutting-edge research, inspiring a generation of students, and producing seminal papers. This article, making use of literature as well as interviews with colleagues of Edith, discusses Ackermann’s contribution to the field, her life trajectory, impact, and ideas. Edith passed away on 24 December 2016.}

abstract = {Technology is an all-encompassing aspect of life in the 21st century. Its existence has implications on how communication occurs, education is shaped, knowledge is spread, and ideas are formulated. There is a significant shift taking place in society as we become more accustomed to existing in a digital world. Digital natives, young people who have been born into a virtual reality, view the world differently, have a ‘digital footprint,’ process info-graphics speedily, but lack basic capacity for interpersonal interactions. They also present neurological differences from those who were exposed to digital technologies later in life. However, regardless of human capacity for technological understanding, digital technologies adversely impact our shared humanity and the ubiquitous nature of these technologies is quite frightening. As a high school English teacher, I experience the impact of digital technologies on learning and language expression first-hand through my work with digital natives. My concern is that because of student dependence on the rapid influx of digital technologies, they will not possess certain imperative faculties of the mind including the ability to embrace mystery, wonderment, and inquiry. There is also concern for the potential loss of creativity. The research that follows attempts to evaluate the impact – both positive and negative – on the domain of language expression including reading, writing, and faculties for imagination and critical thinking. Through thorough examination of neuroscience, trends in reading and writing, usage of electronic communications, social media and politics, levels of digital literacy, primary observations of high school students in a tech-dependent classroom, the evaluations that follow form a basis for theoretical assumptions about technology’s impact on language expression and education.}

abstract = {Much is known about mammalian vision, and considerable progress has been achieved in treating many vision disorders, especially those due to changes in the eye, by using various therapeutic methods, including stem cell and gene therapy. While cells and tissues from the main parts of the eye and the visual cortex (VC) can be maintained in culture, and many computer models exist, the current non-animal approaches are severely limiting in the study of visual perception and retinotopic imaging. Some of the early studies with cats and non-human primates (NHPs) are controversial for animal welfare reasons and are of questionable clinical relevance, particularly with respect to the treatment of amblyopia. More recently, the UK Home Office records have shown that attention is now more focused on rodents, especially the mouse. This is likely to be due to the perceived need for genetically-altered animals, rather than to knowledge of the similarities and differences of vision in cats, NHPs and rodents, and the fact that the same techniques can be used for all of the species. We discuss the advantages and limitations of animal and non-animal methods for vision research, and assess their relative contributions to basic knowledge and clinical practice, as well as outlining the opportunities they offer for implementing the principles of the Three Rs (Replacement, Reduction and Refinement).}

The flight mechanics solver REENT is used in both cases. A closed-loop flight path control is developed and adjusted via low-fi simulations and then verified via high-fi simulations. For simple roll and pitching maneuvers the environments match well, whereas differences can be seen in complex maneuvers, e.g. body–body interactions of separation procedures.}

abstract = {The addition of two emerging technologies (evolutionary computation and ecoinformatics) to computational ecology can advance our ability to build better ecological models and thus deepen our understanding of the mechanistic complexity of ecological systems. This article describes one feasible approach toward this goal–the combining of inductive and deductive modeling techniques with the optimizing power of simple algorithms of Darwinian evolution that include information-theoretic model selection methods. Specifically, the author shows a way to extend classic genetic algorithms beyond typical parameter fitting of a single, previously chosen model to a more flexible technique that can work with a suite of possible models. Inclusion of the Akaike information-theoretic model selection method within an evolutionary algorithm makes it possible to accomplish simultaneous parameter fitting and parsimonious model selection.Experiments with synthetic data show the feasibility of this approach, and experiments with time-series field data of the zebra mussel invasion of Lake Champlain (United States) result in a model of the invasion dynamics that is consistent with the known hydrodynamic features of the lake and the motile life history stage of this invasive species.The author also describes a way to extend this approach with a modified genetic programming algorithm.}

abstract = {Purpose: Numerical flow analysis (computational fluid dynamics) in combination with the prediction of blood damage is an important procedure to investigate the hemocompatibility of a blood pump, since blood trauma due to shear stresses remains a problem in these devices. Today, the numerical damage prediction is conducted using unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations. Investigations with large eddy simulations are rarely being performed for blood pumps. Hence, the aim of the study is to examine the viscous shear stresses of a large eddy simulation in a blood pump and compare the results with an unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation. Methods: The simulations were carried out at two operation points of a blood pump. The flow was simulated on a 100M element mesh for the large eddy simulation and a 20M element mesh for the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulation. As a first step, the large eddy simulation was verified by analyzing internal dissipative losses within the pump. Then, the pump characteristics and mean and turbulent viscous shear stresses were compared between the two simulation methods. Results: The verification showed that the large eddy simulation is able to reproduce the significant portion of dissipative losses, which is a global indication that the equivalent viscous shear stresses are adequately resolved. The comparison with the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulation revealed that the hydraulic parameters were in agreement, but differences for the shear stresses were found. Conclusion: The results show the potential of the large eddy simulation as a high-quality comparative case to check the suitability of a chosen Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes setup and turbulence model. Furthermore, the results lead to suggest that large eddy simulations are superior to unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes simulations when instantaneous stresses are applied for the blood damage prediction.}
