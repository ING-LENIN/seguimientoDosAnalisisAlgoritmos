abstract = {Combinatorial computational geometry, while dealing with geometric objects as discrete entities, provides the means both to analyse and to construct relationships between these objects and relate them to other non-geometrical entities. This paper explores some ways in which this may be used in design through a review of six, one-semester-long design explorations by undergraduate and postgraduate students in the Flexible Modeling for Design and Prototyping course between 2004 and 2007. The course focuses on using computational geometry firstly to construct topologically defined design models based on graphs of relationships between objects (parametric design,) and concurrently to output physical prototypes from these “flexible models” (an application of numerical computational geometry). It supports students to make early design explorations. Many have built flexible models to explore design iterations for a static spatial outcome. Some have built models of real time responsive dynamic systems. In this educational context, computational geometry has enabled a range of design iterations that would have been challenging to uncover through physical analogue means alone. It has, perhaps more significantly, extended the students’ own concept of the space in which they design.}

abstract = {Background BLOCKYLAND is a city building game based on the concept of cellular automata (CA), and urban cellular automata. The game has CA-like processes that invert the role of players from passive observers in other CA applications to active thinkers. The processes challenge players to apply logical thinking and decision making from the perspective of serious games. The players’ mission is to build a city by applying the provided CA rules. Two types of CA rules are provided: 1) The logical rule, whereby players apply to build the city according to the preset conditions, and 2) The optional rule, whereby they may apply to upgrade an existing building for an extra score. Aim This article aims to present the design and development of CA-based game, BLOCKYLAND and describe its effectiveness as an instructional tool to enhance logical thinking. Results Results from the mixed-method pilot study show that BLOCKYLAND enhanced players’ logical thinking after the gameplay. Additionally, from the extensive debriefing following the game, participants stated that the game aided them with transforming their game experiences into learning experiences and relating the logical thinking practice into real-life application. Results Conclusion. As a combination of logical thinking practices and a serious game, BLOCKYLAND has several implications for educational stakeholders; both theoretical and practical.}

abstract = {Abstract The present paper discusses the basic principles of hydraulic turbines, with special emphasis on the use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as a tool which is being increasingly applied to gain insight into the complex three-dimensional (3D) phenomena occurring in these types of fluid machinery. The basic fluid mechanics is briefly treated for the three main types of hydraulic turbine: Pelton, Francis and axial turbines. From the vast number of applications where CFD has proven to be an important help to the design engineer, two examples have been chosen for a detailed discussion. The first example gives a comparison of experimental data and 3D Euler and 3D Navier-Stokes results for the flow in a Francis runner. The second example highlights the state-of-the-art of predicting the performance of an entire Francis turbine by means of numerical simulation.}

abstract = {People who interact with graphs to perform arithmetic tasks typically employ quantitative features. However, they may employ the spatial metaphor under two alternative conditions: if they have been trained to apply visual arithmetic methods to traditional line and bar graphs, or if they interact with specially constructed and special-purpose computational graphics. Two experiments explored a visual arithmetic method used to train subjects to determine a mean by locating the spatial midpoint of a set of indicators (bars in a bar graph or points in a line graph). In Experiment 1 visual arithmetic subjects determined the mean of five indicators as quickly as they did the mean of two indicators; control subjects performed slower with five indicators. Both groups took more time to add the values of five indicators than to add two indicators. In Experiment 2, unlike control subjects, visual arithmetic subjects’ response times in mean trials were unaffected by changes in the y-axis scale. However, both groups were affected by the y-axis scale on addition trials. Neither group was influenced by changes in the distance between indicators. The discussion addresses the transfer of visual arithmetic training to tasks that differ from the one used during training, uses for visual arithmetic and computational graphics, and the role of parallel processing and task restructuring in visual arithmetic.}

abstract = {In this paper, two alternative numerical approaches for the simulation of Gerotor units are compared: a fast lumped parameter approach for the fluid dynamics through the unit that permits the co-simulation of the radial micro-motion of the rotors, and a computational fluid dynamics approach that puts emphasis on the description of the detailed features of the flow through the unit. Each approach provides unique insights on the unit operation, although with different assumptions and level of result details. For an objective comparison of these two state-of-art models, the authors compared their results with experiments. A commercial pump taken as reference, and tests focused on steady-state volumetric performance as well as the transient features of the outlet port pressure oscillations. The results presented in the paper permit to gain a high level of understanding of the operation of the unit and of the critical aspects that a designer should consider while analyzing such design of positive displacement machines. While comparing the two simulation approaches, the paper highlights the limits and the strengths of each one of the two approaches. In particular, it is shown how both models can match the experimental results considering proper assumptions, in terms of technological clearances and rotors’ micro-motions. The paper constitutes a unique contribution in the field of numerical simulation of Gerotor units and represents a useful reference to the designers looking for suitable methods for simulating existing or novel design solutions.}

abstract = {How robust is a healthcare system? How does a patient navigate the system and what is the cost (e.g., number of medical services required or number of times the medical provider had to be changed to get access to the required medical services) incurred from the first symptoms to getting cured? How will it fare in the wake to a sudden epidemic or a disaster? How are all of these affected by administrative decisions such as allocating/diminishing resources in various areas or centralising services? These are the questions motivating our study on a formal prototype model for a healthcare system. We propose that a healthcare system can be understood as a distributed system with independent nodes (healthcare providers) computing according to their own resources and constraints, with tasks (patient needs) being allocated between the nodes. The questions about the healthcare system become in this context questions about resource availability and distribution between the nodes. We construct in this paper an Event-B model capturing the basic functionality of a simplified healthcare system: patients with different types of medical needs being allocated to suitable medical providers, and navigating between different providers for their turn for multi-step treatments.}

abstract = {Is it possible to induce a mind-set that will affect relational thinking in a subsequent reasoning task involving unrelated materials? We investigated whether evaluating the validity of verbal analogies (Experiment 1a) or generating solutions for them (Experiment 1b) could induce a relational mind-set that would transfer to an unrelated picture-mapping task. The verbal analogies were based on either near or far semantic relations. We found that generating (but not evaluating) solutions for semantically distant analogies increased the proportion of relational mappings on the transfer task, even after we controlled for fluid intelligence and response time. Solving near analogies did not produce transfer. Generation of solutions to far analogies appears to provide a potent method for triggering a mind-set that can enhance relational thinking in a different task.}
