abstract = {In this study, a mathematical model simulating the flow of ethylene glycol as a micropolar fluid supported by copper or graphene oxide nanoparticles around a cylinder affected by a magnetic field is established. A computational approximation is introduced for the solution of the governing mathematical model using the Keller-Box approximation. In addition, computations are executed with the aid of the MATLAB program to obtain numerical and graphical outcomes and validate and assess them. The graphical outcomes of the influential factors on the physical quantities related to energy transmission are analyzed and discussed. According to these outcomes, all physical groups are decreasing functions of the micropolar factor. With the exception of temperature, increasing the intensity of magnetic parameters has a negative impact on the studied physical groups. The fractional volume factor increases friction forces, the Nusselt number, and the temperature while decreasing velocity and angular velocity.}

abstract = {Hydrogen (H2) nonpremixed combustion has been showcased as a potentially viable and preferable strategy for direct-injection compression-ignition (DICI) engines for its ability to deliver high heat release rates and low heat transfer losses, in addition to potentially zero CO2 emissions. However, this concept requires a different optimization strategy compared to conventional diesel engines, prioritizing a combustion mode dominated by free turbulent jet mixing. In the present work, this optimization strategy is realized and studied computationally using the CONVERGE CFD solver. It involves adopting wide piston bowl designs with shapes adapted to the H2 jets, altered injector umbrella angle, and an increased number of nozzle orifices with either smaller orifice diameter or reduced injection pressure to maintain constant injector flow rate capacity. This work shows that these modifications are effective at maximizing free-jet mixing, thus enabling more favorable heat release profiles, reducing wall heat transfer by 35%, and improving indicated efficiency by 2.2 percentage points. However, they also caused elevated incomplete combustion losses at low excess air ratios, which may be eliminated by implementing a moderate swirl, small post-injections, and further optimized jet momentum and piston design. Noise emissions with the optimized DICI H2 combustion are shown to be comparable to those from conventional diesel engines. Finally, it is demonstrated that modern engine concepts, such as the double compression-expansion engine, may achieve around 56% brake thermal efficiency with the DICI H2 combustion, which is 1.1 percentage point higher than with diesel fuel. Thus, this work contributes to the knowledge base required for future improvements in H2 engine efficiency.}

abstract = {This study aims to predict the overall aerodynamic performance, unsteady forces and the tonal noise radiation from a small axial flow fan. The computation is divided into two stages: (a) the computation of the unsteady flow field at design and off-design working conditions, and (b) detailed analysis of the acoustic field. A dual-time scheme for dealing with rotor-stator or wake-struts interactions in turbomachinery environments by introducing a pseudo-time to represent the time variation of source terms and the finite volume control method are applied for the unsteady solutions involving the whole flow passages of the axial flow fan, and the pressure rise against volume flow rate is obtained and shown to be in good agreement with experimental data. The interaction of the rotor wake and the downstream struts has been simulated by investigating the effects of source distribution over the whole blades. And the tonal noise is then predicted based on Lowson’s theory. The unsteady force is divided into thrust in the rotational axis direction and drag in the rotational direction for the rotor and struts. It is demonstrated that the unsteady forces acting on the rotor and struts are produced by the interaction between them, and has a close relationship with the rotor wake structure and the strut alignment. In the rotor near wake, both the viscous and potential flow is dominant not only to aerodynamic forces but also to interaction noise. The present study shows that the higher lean angle of struts can gain about 4 dB reduction of overall sound power level compared to the smallest one.}

abstract = {General value functions (GVFs) in the reinforcement learning (RL) literature are long-term predictive summaries of the outcomes of agents following specific policies in the environment. Affordances as perceived action possibilities with specific valence may be cast into predicted policy-relative goodness and modeled as GVFs. A systematic explication of this connection shows that GVFs and especially their deep-learning embodiments (1) realize affordance prediction as a form of direct perception, (2) illuminate the fundamental connection between action and perception in affordance, and (3) offer a scalable way to learn affordances using RL methods. Through an extensive review of existing literature on GVF applications and representative affordance research in robotics, we demonstrate that GVFs provide the right framework for learning affordances in real-world applications. In addition, we highlight a few new avenues of research opened up by the perspective of “affordance as GVF,” including using GVFs for orchestrating complex behaviors.}

abstract = {Objective: To elucidate the mechanics of scalp rotation flaps through 3D imaging and computational modeling. Excessive tension near a wound or sutured region can delay wound healing or trigger complications. Measuring tension in the operating room is challenging, instead, noninvasive methods to improve surgical planning are needed. Design: Multi-view stereo allows creation of 3D patient-specific geometries based on a set of photographs. The patient-specific 3D geometry is imported into a finite element (FE) platform to perform a virtual procedure. The simulation is compared with the clinical outcome. Additional simulations quantify the effect of individual flap parameters on the resulting tension distribution. Participants: Rotation flaps for reconstruction of scalp defects following melanoma resection in 2 cases are presented. Rotation flaps were designed without preoperative FE preparation. Main Outcome Measure: Tension distribution over the operated region. Results: The tension from FE shows peaks at the base and distal ends of the scalp rotation flap. The predicted geometry from the simulation aligns with postoperative photographs. Simulations exploring the flap design parameters show variation in the tension. Lower tensions were achieved when rotation was oriented with respect to skin tension lines (horizontal tissue fibers) and smaller rotation angles. Conclusions: Tension distribution following rotation of scalp flaps can be predicted through personalized FE simulations. Flaps can be designed to reduce tension using FE, which may greatly improve the reliability of scalp reconstruction in craniofacial surgery, critical in complex cases when scalp reconstruction is essential for coverage of hardware, implants, and/or bone graft.}

Whereas some suggest that learning to program and other contacts with IPT will empower thinking, it is argued from both theory and evidence that typical contacts with IPT today do not meet certain conditions for significantly reshaping thought. Whereas others suggest that IPT will have a narrowing and dehumanizing influence, it is argued that the striking diversification of IPT now underway will eventually allow for many styles of involvement. In the long term, as this diversification spreads to nearly all aspects of society, thinking may change in certain basic ways as it has in response to literacy and print.}

abstract = {The shape of dose response of ionizing radiation (IR) induced cancer at low dose region, either linear non-threshold or J-shaped, has been a debate for a long time. This dose response relationship can be influenced by built-in capabilities of cells that minimize the fixation of IR-mediated DNA damage as pro-carcinogenic mutations. Key capabilities include sensing of damage, activation of cell cycle checkpoint arrests that provide time needed for repair of the damage as well as apoptosis. Here we describe computational modeling of the signaling pathways that link sensing of DNA damage and checkpoint arrest activation/apoptosis to investigate how these molecular-level interactions influence the dose response relationship for IR induced cancer. The model provides qualitatively accurate descriptions of the IR-mediated activation of cell cycle checkpoints and the apoptotic pathway, and of time-course activities and dose response of relevant regulatory proteins (e.g. p53 and p21). Linking to a two-stage clonal growth cancer model, the model described here successfully captured a monotonically increasing to a J-shaped dose response curve and identified one potential mechanism leading to the J-shape: the cell cycle checkpoint arrest time saturates with the increase of the dose.}
