abstract = {In the run-up to any major sports tournament, winning probabilities of participants are publicized for engagement and betting purposes. These are generally based on simulating the tournament tens of thousands of times by sampling from single-match outcome models. We show that, by virtue of the tournament schedule, exact computation of winning probabilties can be substantially faster than their approximation through simulation. This notably applies to recent FIFA World Cups and is independent of the model used for individual match outcomes.}

abstract = {Recent years have seen a significant increase in the importance of environmental protection and sustainability to consumers, policy makers, and society in general. Reflecting this, most organizations are at least aware of this new agenda and wish to be seen as taking steps to improve behaviors in this regard. However, there appears to be a gap between this evolving agenda and the comparatively low level of knowledge that marketing managers actually have of the environmental impact of their own functional decisions. We suggest that this low knowledge level may be due, in part, to the marketplace focus of foundational marketing educational programs, and we attempt to show how broadening the horizons of marketing courses can help students (i.e., future managers) more deeply understand the environmental consequences of their actions. We demonstrate the use of a novel business game, based on the Life Cycle Assessment method, as the foundational cornerstone for the development of a broad understanding of the environmental impact of marketing decisions and actions for the entire life cycle of a product—from raw material extraction to ultimate disposal. The results of an empirical study show that this approach increases students’ appreciation for, and understanding of, these fundamental environmental sustainability concepts.}

abstract = {Rett syndrome is an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder, primarily caused by MECP2 mutations. In this study, clinical, molecular and bioinformatics analyses were performed in Rett patients to understand the relationship between MECP2 mutation type and the clinical severity. Two double MeCP2 mutations were detected: a novel one (p.G185 V in cis with p.R255X) in P1 and a known one (p.P179 S in cis with p.R255X) in P2. Besides, a novel synonymous mutation (c.807C>T; p.G269G), which could affect mRNA splicing, was identified in P3. The results from clinical severity analysis have shown that P1 was more severely affected than P2 with CSS being 35 and 14, respectively. Therefore, the phenotypic variability in P1 and P2 could be explained by the potential pathogenic effect of the RTT-causing missense mutation p.G185 V in the AT-hook1. In conclusion, clinical, molecular, and in silico investigations in the studied patients have been proven to be substantial for the genotype-phenotype correlation.}

abstract = {The paradox motivating this article is why California has acted globally by enacting a comprehensive mitigation policy to reduce the emissions of Greenhouse gases, a true public good since the benefits will be shared across the planet, but has not mustered the will to act locally through the adoption of an equally comprehensive adaptation policy for the state to protect its own public and private assets and interests. We attempt to explain the paradox by identifying what it is that differentiates climate change adaptation from mitigation, both substantively and politically. The paradox notwithstanding, we identify several imaginable adaptation policies and strategies that would be commensurate with individual and collective self-interested behavior.}

abstract = {Current developments in the statistics community suggest that modern statistics education should be structured holistically, that is, by allowing students to work with real data and to answer concrete statistical questions, but also by educating them about alternative frameworks, such as Bayesian inference. In this article, we describe how we incorporated such a holistic structure in a Bayesian research project on ordered binomial probabilities. The project was conducted with a group of three undergraduate psychology students who had basic knowledge of Bayesian statistics and programming, but lacked formal mathematical training. The research project aimed to (1) convey the basic mathematical concepts of Bayesian inference; (2) have students experience the entire empirical cycle including collection, analysis, and interpretation of data and (3) teach students open science practices.}
