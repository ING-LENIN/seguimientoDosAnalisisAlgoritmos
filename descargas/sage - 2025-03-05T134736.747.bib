abstract = {The three-dimensional (3D) printing of polymer matrix composites has attracted considerable attention. However, the addition of filler materials to the extruded polymer matrix results in inner voids within the beads along with larger voids, called intervoids, which are generated between the beads during the 3D printing process. These voids degrade the thermal transport properties of 3D-printed polyether ether ketone (PEEK) and PEEK/carbon-fiber composites. The effects of these pores (i.e., their number, size, and location) on the thermal conductivity of 3D-printed PEEK and a PEEK/carbon-fiber composite were investigated using a multiscale finite element approach. The presence of the carbon fibers mitigated the effect of the pores on the thermal conductivity of the PEEK/carbon-fiber composite, particularly along the longitudinal direction. Moreover, the inner voids had a dominant effect on the PEEK and PEEK/carbon-fiber composite. Finally, the orientation of the intervoids had no effect on the thermal conductivity of the printed materials.}

abstract = {In online social networks, spam profiles represent one of the most serious security threats over the Internet; if they do not stop producing bad advertisements, they can be exploited by criminals for various purposes. This article addresses the nature and the characteristics of spam profiles in a social network like Twitter to improve spam detection, based on a number of publicly available language-independent features. In order to investigate the effectiveness of these features in spam detection, four datasets are extracted for four different language contexts (i.e. Arabic, English, Korean and Spanish), and a fifth is formed by combining them all. We conduct our experiments using a set of five well-known classification algorithms in spam detection field, k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN), Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT) (J48) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) classifiers, along with five filter-based feature selection methods, namely, Information Gain, Chi-square, ReliefF, Correlation and Significance. The results show oscillating performance of each classifier across all datasets, but improved classification results with feature selection. In addition, detailed analysis and comparisons are carried out on two different levels: in the first level, we compare the selected features’ importance among the feature selection methods, whereas in the second level, we observe the relations and the importance of the selected features across all datasets. The findings of this article lead to a better understanding of social spam and improving detection methods by considering the various important features resulting from the different lingual contexts.}

abstract = {Transformation plasticity, essential during solid–solid phase transitions, significantly impacts industrial processes like welding and quenching. Accurately simulating these procedures necessitates understanding thermal, metallurgical, and mechanical effects. Leblond et al.’s model offers a foundation, but refinement for mixed isotropic/kinematic hardening is crucial. We enhance this model by introducing characteristic length scales through nonlocal variables, illuminating plastic deformation mechanisms in both phases. Our work includes numerical implementation within a finite element analysis framework and practical applications to phase transformation scenarios involving A.508 cl. 3 and A533 low-alloy steels. Results affirm model robustness and efficiency in predicting phase transformation phenomena, benefiting industrial applications.}

abstract = {Quality control and read preprocessing are critical steps in the analysis of data sets generated from high-throughput genomic screens. In the most extreme cases, improper preprocessing can negatively affect downstream analyses and may lead to incorrect biological conclusions. Here, we present PathoQC, a streamlined toolkit that seamlessly combines the benefits of several popular quality control software approaches for preprocessing next-generation sequencing data. PathoQC provides a variety of quality control options appropriate for most high-throughput sequencing applications. PathoQC is primarily developed as a module in the PathoScope software suite for metagenomic analysis. However, PathoQC is also available as an open-source Python module that can run as a stand-alone application or can be easily integrated into any bioinformatics workflow. PathoQC achieves high performance by supporting parallel computation and is an effective tool that removes technical sequencing artifacts and facilitates robust downstream analysis. The PathoQC software package is available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/PathoScope/.}

This study utilized a quasi-experimental group design to investigate the impact of universally designed engineering curriculum on 43 students with intellectual disability and autism display of engineering habits of mind (e.g., persist and learn from failure) during ongoing Engineering is Elementary design challenges. A statistically significant difference between the control and treatment groups was found. Findings suggest engineering instruction may support student development of problem-solving skills.}

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a symbolic model to analyse protocols that use a bilinear pairing between two cyclic groups. This model consists in an extension of the Abadi–Rogaway logic and we prove that the logic is still computationally sound: symbolic indistinguishability implies computational indistinguishability provided that the Bilinear Decisional Diffie–Hellman assumption holds and that the encryption scheme is IND-CPA secure. We illustrate our results on classical protocols using bilinear pairing like Joux tripartite Diffie–Hellman protocol or the TAK-2 and TAK-3 protocols. We also investigate the security of a newly designed variant of the Burmester–Desmedt protocol using bilinear pairings. More precisely, we show for each of these protocols that the generated key is indistinguishable from a random element.}

abstract = {Aspects of criminological theory are premised on the belief that criminals make poor decisions. There have been suggestions that individual differences in self-control, willpower, impulsivity, time orientation, or more recently, thoughtfully reflective decision making (TRDM) influence choices and, ultimately, deviant outcomes. While much of the literature suggests there are differences among these concepts, they are often used interchangeably or at least noted to share common ground. Using survey data collected from university undergraduate students, this article explores the conceptual and empirical overlap and areas of distinction between key theoretical constructs. Using hypotheses derived from a dual-systems model, findings suggest impulsivity, self-control, temptation, and TRDM are distinct but interrelated constructs. Impulsivity was positively related to intentions to drink and drive in a hypothetical scenario, but temptation, self-control, and TRDM had no significant effect on intentions. Consistent with a dual-systems conceptualization, we found impulsivity and self-control work in tandem, as the risk of drinking and driving was highest for those respondents who were highly impulsive and had low self-control. Future research may seek to use a dual-system model to further reconcile trait-based and decision-based models of criminological theory.}

abstract = {This essay reflects on the role of place for humanities practices and contributes to emerging discussions on infrastructure for the humanities and socio-material conditions of scholarly knowledge production. I provide a theoretical framework for studying venues for humanities work drawing on the phenomenological approach to the concepts of place and space, the pedagogical perspective on learning spaces in higher education, and epistemological studies of scientific places. Next, I analyse the landscape for the reconfiguration of humanities venues and present arguments for engaging with space by referring to the functioning of digital humanities. This essay shows that place is an extremely important resource, seeing as it is endowed with the power to drive new practices, institutionalize a community, and consolidate a discipline. Therefore, humanists should reflect critically on the ‘architecture of the humanities’ and engage in making their own spaces that determine practices, communication, and well-being.}
