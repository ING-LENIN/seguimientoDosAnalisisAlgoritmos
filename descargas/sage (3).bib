N2 - Computational thinking (CT) uses concepts that are essential to computing and information science to solve problems, design and evaluate complex systems, and understand human reasoning and behavior. This way of thinking has important implications in computer sciences as well as in almost every other field. Therefore, we contend that CT should be taught in elementary schools and included in every university’s educational curriculum. Several studies that measure the impact of teaching programming, analytical thinking, and CT have been conducted. In this review, we analyze and discuss findings from these studies and highlight the importance of learning programming with a focus on the development of CT skills at a young age. We also describe the tools that are available to improve the teaching of CT and provide a state-of-the-art overview of how programming is being taught at schools and universities in Colombia and around the world.

N2 - Computational Thinking (CT) and creativity are considered two vital skills for the 21st century that should be incorporated into future curricula around the world. We studied the relationship between these two constructs while focusing on learners’ personal characteristics. Two types of creativity were examined: creative thinking and computational creativity. The research was conducted among 174 middle school students from Spain. Data collected using a standardized creativity test (Torrance’s TTCT) were triangulated with data drawn from students’ log files that documented their activity in a game-based learning environment for CT (Kodetu). We found some interesting associations between CT and the two constructs of creativity. These associations shed light on positive associations between each of the two creativity constructs and CT acquisition, as well as between the two creativity constructs themselves. Additionally, we highlight differences between boys and girls, as girls were found to be more creative on both creativity measures. Other differences associated with school affiliation, prior coding knowledge, and technology affinity are also discussed.

N2 - Over the past decade, initiatives around the world have introduced computing into K–12 education under the umbrella of computational thinking. While initial implementations focused on skills and knowledge for college and career readiness, more recent framings include situated computational thinking (identity, participation, creative expression) and critical computational thinking (political and ethical impacts of computing, justice). This expansion reflects a revaluation of what it means for learners to be computationally-literate in the 21st century. We review the current landscape of K–12 computing education, discuss interactions between different framings of computational thinking, and consider how an encompassing framework of computational literacies clarifies the importance of computing for broader K–12 educational priorities as well as key unresolved issues.

N2 - This multiple case study aimed to investigate ESL teachers’ practices when they learn and design their ESL lesson activities, with a particular emphasis on the integration of computational thinking through Scratch. Scratch was considered as the computational thinking platform, and teachers were designers of language instruction with/for computational thinking. We aimed to explore ESL teachers’ lesson designs incorporating computational tools. We collected audio and video recordings from individual workshops and semi-structured interviews and then conducted a thematic analysis. Five themes emerged: (a) learning experiences shaped project designs, (b) teachers’ understanding of student’s interests and age appropriateness shaped Scratch projects and pedagogical choices, (c) integrating computational thinking with ESL instruction was challenging, (d) efforts were made to reduce technical and content challenges, and (e) teachers considered and used Scratch as an ESL tool. Our findings underscored teacher agency in how teachers adapted their instruction based on perceived student needs and capabilities.

N2 - Recent advances in artificial intelligence have brought attention to computational thinking (CT) in school education worldwide. However, little is known about the development of the literacy of CT in children, mainly because of the lack of proper psychometric assessments. We developed the first psychometrically validated assessment on the literacy of CT of children in Chinese elementary schools, coined as the Computational Thinking Assessment for Chinese Elementary Students (CTA-CES). Items were constructed to reflect key aspects of CT such as abstraction, algorithm thinking, decomposition, evaluation, and pattern recognition. To examine the test reliability and validity, we recruited two samples of 280 third- to sixth-grade students in total. Cronbach’s alpha provided evidence for the reliability of the test scores, item response theory analyses demonstrated psychometric appropriateness, whereas construct validity was verified by convergent validity, and criterion-related validity was confirmed by correlations between the CTA-CES and measures related to CT, namely reasoning, spatial ability, and verbal ability. In addition, an fMRI study further demonstrated similar neural activation patterns when students conducted the CTA-CES and programming tasks. Taken together, the CTA-CES is the first reliable and valid instrument for measuring the literacy of CT for Chinese children, and may be applicable to children worldwide.

N2 - This meta-analysis determined game-based learning’s (GBL) overall effect on students’ computational thinking (CT) and tested for moderators, using 28 effect sizes from 24 studies of 2,134 participants. The random effects model results showed that GBL had a significant positive overall effect on students’ CT (g = 0.677, 95% confidence interval 0.532–0.821) with significant heterogeneity among effect sizes. Among game types, role-playing yielded the largest GBL effect size, followed by action, puzzles, and adventures. Moreover, the effect of GBL on CT was weaker among students in countries that were more individualistic than others. Lastly, interventions between four hours and one week showed the largest GBL effect size, followed by those over four weeks, up to four hours, and between one week and four weeks.

N2 - This paper examines a method which can be used by instructors pursuing innovative methods for language teaching, which expands learners’ motivation in second language learning. Computational thinking (CT) is a problem-solving skill which can motivate students’ English language learning. Designing a learning activity which integrates CT into English language learning has been considered in only a few academic studies. This study aimed to explore whether integrating CT into English language learning can be useful for improving learners’ motivation and performance. The method of “present, practice, and produce” was applied as a method of presenting computational thinking in the English language learning classroom. Fifty-two elementary school students (52) participated in the experimental study. Following an experimental design, data were collected and analyzed from a combination of knowledge test scores, storytelling, motivation, and anxiety surveys. The experimental results indicate that the CT strategy improves students’ language learning and raises their motivation in the two dimensions of extrinsic and intrinsic goal orientation. These results imply the positive effect of CT strategy on strengthening problem-solving skills of students participating in digital storytelling and increases their motivation and performance in English language learning.

N2 - The Computer Science Teachers Association has asserted that computational thinking equips students with essential critical thinking which allows them to conceptualize, analyze, and solve more complex problems. These skills are applicable to all content area as students learn to use strategies, ideas, and technological practices more effectively as digital natives. This research examined over 200 elementary students’ pre- and posttest changes in computational thinking from a 10-week coding program using adapted lessons from code.org’s Blockly programming language and CSUnplugged that were delivered as part of the regular school day. Participants benefited from early access to computer science (CS) lessons with increases in computational thinking and applying coding concepts to the real world. Interviews from participants included examples of CS connections to everyday life and interdisciplinary studies at school. Thus, the study highlights the importance of leveraging CS access in diverse elementary classrooms to promote young students’ computational thinking; motivation in CS topics; and the learning of essential soft-skills such as collaboration, persistence, abstraction, and creativity to succeed in today’s digital world.

N2 - Computational thinking (CT) is a fundamental skill for students, and assessment is a critical factor in education. However, there is a lack of effective approaches to CT assessment. Therefore, we designed the Three-Dimensional Integrated Assessment (TDIA) framework in this article. The TDIA has two aims: one was to integrate three dimensions (directionality, openness, and process) into the design of effective assessment tasks; and the other was to assess comprehensively the three dimensions of CT including computational concepts, practices, and perspectives. Guided by the TDIA framework, we designed three pairs of tasks: closed forward tasks and closed reverse tasks, semiopen forward tasks and semiopen reverse tasks, and open tasks with a creative design report and open tasks without a creative design report. To further confirm each task’s applicability and its advantages and disadvantages, we conducted a test experiment at the end of the autumn semester in 2014 in a primary school for 3 weeks. The results indicated that (a) the reverse tasks were not more superior than the forward tasks; (b) the semiopen tasks and the open tasks were more effective than the closed tasks, and the semiopen tasks had higher difficulty and discrimination than the others; (c) the self-reports provided a helpful function for learning diagnosis and guidance; (d) the scores had no significant difference between the schoolboys and the schoolgirls in all six tasks; and (e) the six tasks’ difficulty and discrimination were all acceptable, and the semiopen tasks had higher difficulty and discrimination than the others. To effectively apply them, the following suggestions for teachers to design computational tasks are proposed: motivating students’ interest and enthusiasm, incorporating semifinished artifacts, involving learning diagnosis and guidance, and including multiple types of tasks in an assessment.
