abstract = {Free convection of various nanofluids inside concentric and eccentric annular cavity with internal heat flux, fully filled with porous media is studied numerically and its heat transfer rate and pressure drop are examined. The impact of inner cylinder inclination angles (βecc = 45°, 135°, 225°, and 270°) and nanofluids (Al2O3/water, CuO/water and SiO2/water) for different heat flux (1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000 w/m2) on the heat transfer rate are evaluated. Initially, a validation process has been implemented to ensure that the predicted results obtained from this model are accurate. Results indicate that Al2O3 Nanofluid provides a better enhancement in the heat transfer rate when compared to SiO2 and Cu Nanofluids. Furthermore, the heat transfer coefficient increased with the inclination angle of βecc = 225°, and maximum heat transfer occurred at a heat flux of 4000 W/m2, which was roughly 6% greater than the concentric annular cylinder. The findings also indicated that while increasing the eccentricity has a minor impact on the heat transfer rate for convection-dominated flows (high heat flux), on the other hand, it has a significant impact on the heat transfer rate for conduction-dominated flows (low heat flux).}

abstract = {This ethnographic case investigates the relationship between the daily organizing work of one education technology “intermediary organization” (IO) in Silicon Valley, California and federal education technology policies. I argue that the IO constructed policy knowledge that reified discourses of “digital meritocracy”: a belief in digital technologies as a means of evaluating individual success, regardless of historic, place-based material inequities. To develop this concept, I trace themes of “personalization” and “everywhere” as they emerge in the IO’s daily work and in federal education technology policies. This study extends research on IOs as “brokers” of information, resources, and social ties between public schools and private service providers and argues that IOs also construct “policy knowledge,” or “definitions of what counts as education.”}

abstract = {Traditionally, students have demonstrated substantial difficulties in the area of problem solving. Their strategies appear to be limited as they look for key words or rely on gimmicks to assist in the solution of word problems. The process is mindless, inefficient, and ineffective. This area of weakness is especially prevalent in the mildly handicapped population. The importance of problem-solving skills for these students is critical, as they engage not only in mathematical decisions but as they make functional decisions in their daily lives. A sequential hierarchy is presented that establishes a process for students to follow when confronted with problem-solving issues. The step-by-step process enhances student understanding and control. Problem solving becomes planned and deliberate. Implementing the SOLVE strategies enables the teacher to assess and teach the skills and improves students’ success rates.}

abstract = {In gas turbines, rim seals are fitted at the periphery of the wheel-space between the turbine disc and its adjacent casing; their purpose is to reduce the ingress of hot mainstream gases. This paper describes the use of a three-dimensional, steady-state model to investigate ingress through engine-representative single and double radial-clearance seals. The three-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes computations of a simplified turbine stage are carried out using the commercial computational fluid dynamics code ANSYS CFX v13, and the model is based on the geometry of an experimental test rig at the University of Bath. The measured variation of the peak-to-trough pressure difference in the annulus, which is the main driving mechanism for ingress, is reproduced well qualitatively by the computations; quantitatively, the maximum local differences between computation and experiment are less than 20% of the measured peak-to-trough circumferential variation. The radial variation of swirl ratio in the rotor–stator wheel-space is well predicted over the range of flow rates and rim seal geometries studied. The radial distribution of sealing effectiveness determined from experiments is reproduced inward of the mixing region near the seal clearance over a range of sealing flow rates; some over-prediction of the effectiveness was found for both seals at high radius, probably due to limitations in the turbulent mixing modelling. The three-dimensional steady-state approach may be a practical tool for the engine designer where there is a lack of experimental data, providing quantitative predictions of the flow structure within the rotor–stator wheel-space and qualitative predictions of the sealing effectiveness for a given rim seal geometry.}

abstract = {Advances in data accessibility and analytical methods opened new frontiers for comparative studies of European legislative activities. However, these advances still need to be fully harnessed by legislative scholars for multiple reasons. We provide an overview of extant research agendas to identify these reasons and explore the opportunities for tapping the potential of big data and quantitative text analysis. We present significant data collection efforts, such as ParlSpeech, the Comparative Agendas Project and CLARIN, and highlight their respective value for, primarily, large-N comparative research focusing on European Union member states and the European Union itself. Our review highlights the most consequential gaps in the literature and shortcomings of available data and analysis. These include the lack of extensive historical and geographical coverage, missing harmonisation and cross-linking between separate efforts, no unified speech and document (bill, law) databases, and the unavailability of good-quality full-text variables.}

This article presents a life-cycle management framework for online monitoring and performance assessment of wind turbines, enabling optimum maintenance and inspection planning at minimum associated life-cycle costs. Incorporating continuously updated monitoring data (i.e. structural, environmental, and operational data), the framework allows capturing and understanding the actual wind turbine condition and, hence, reduces uncertainty in structural responses as well as load effects acting on the structure. As will be shown in this article, the framework integrates a variety of heterogeneous hardware and software components, including sensors and data acquisition units, server systems, Internet-enabled user interfaces as well as finite element models for system identification, and a multiagent system for self-detecting sensor malfunctions. To validate its capabilities and to demonstrate its practicability, the framework is deployed for continuous monitoring and life-cycle management of a 500-kW wind turbine. Remote life-cycle analyses of the monitored wind turbine are conducted, and case studies are presented investigating both the structural performance and the operational efficiency of the wind turbine.}
