abstract = {This study sheds light on a holistic understanding of muqarnas with its historical, philosophical and conceptual backgrounds on one hand and formal, structural and algorithmic principles on the other hand. The vault-like Islamic architectural element, muqarnas, is generally considered to be a non-structural decorative element. Various compositional approaches have been proposed to reveal the inner logic of these complex geometric elements. Each of these approaches uses different techniques such as measuring, unit-based decoding or three-dimensional interpretation of two-dimensional patterns. However, the reflections of the inner logic onto different contexts, such as the usage of different initial geometries, materials or performative concerns, were neglected. In this study, we offer a new schema to approach the performative aspects of muqarnas tectonics. This schema contains new sets of elements, properties and relations deriving partly from previous approaches and partly from the technique of folding. Thus, this study first reviews the previous approaches to analyse the geometric and constructional principles of muqarnas. Second, it explains the proposed scheme through a series of algorithmic form-finding experiments. In these experiments, we question whether ‘fold’, as one of the performative techniques of making three-dimensional forms, contributes to the analysis of muqarnas in both a conceptual and computational sense. We argue that encoding vault-like systems via geometric and algorithmic relations based on the logic of the ‘fold’ provides informative and intuitive feedback for form-finding, specifically in the earlier phases of design. While focusing on the performative potential of a specific fold operation, we introduced the concept of bifurcation to describe the generative characteristics of folding technique and the way of subdividing the form with respect to redistribution of the forces. Thus, in this decoding process, the bifurcated fold explains not only to demystify the formal logic of muqarnas but also to generate new forms without losing contextual conditions.}

abstract = {Journalism education has historically adapted its practices to align with newspaper hiring imperatives. As digital newsrooms increasingly integrate computational approaches, journalism educators are again challenged to innovate. Journalism studies scholarship—to date—has often ignored institutional factors that interplay with the product of programmatic curricula. As a population study of accredited programs at land grant institutions, this work identifies how American journalism programs are readying newspaper newsworkers for tomorrow’s newsrooms.}

abstract = {With the introduction and implementation of core literacy, scientific thinking (ST) has become an essential goal and key dimension of science teaching. At present, there is no agreement on how to cultivate students’ ST. This study took 238 sixth grade students from a public primary school in urban China as research sample, built a theoretical model of scientific thinking development based on the theory of the Bronfenbrenner’ ecological systems theory, and used multiple data to explore and analyze the impact path of ST development of primary school students using the fuzzy sets of qualitative comparative analysis method (fsQCA). The development of urban primary school students’ ST is the result of multiple factors at the level of individual drive, family environment, school teaching, and social resources. The result of data analysis showed that the influence path of ST development of urban primary school students driven by multiple factors includes three paths: parent participation leading, scientific practice leading, and home-school-community integration. We have interpreted the influence mechanism of each path in detail and put forward the enlightenment for science education policy and practice.}

abstract = {This article reflects on how the ingression of computation in culture has not only transformed media into algorithmic devices but has also, more importantly, led to the automation of the most precious faculty of the human, namely, reasoning. This article problematizes the tout court refusal of algorithmic thinking as thinking and suggests that we are witnessing the advance of a dynamic form of automated reasoning, exposing the limits of the critical approach toward the calculative. The article points out that the alliance between algorithmic automation and the digital infrastructure of neoliberalism is not without significance, but attention must be paid to the specific posthuman form of cognitive capitalism.}

The survey reveals that there is an ongoing transition from the instrumentalisation of computers as tools for calculations, to the implementation of information science methodologies for analysis, deduction, knowledge representation, and reasoning, as part of the research process in social anthropology.

abstract = {Integration of computational data science (CDS) into the university curriculum offers several advantages for students, faculty and the institution. This article discusses the benefits to students of introducing CDS into the university curriculum with a focus on developing skills in cheminformatics, data analysis, structure–activity relationships, modelling and simulation. Moreover, CDS can enable students to engage with complex chemical and toxicological data in new and dynamic ways, helping them to develop a more nuanced understanding of the potential hazards and risks associated with different chemicals and substances. On the other hand, it can foster greater collaboration between students and faculty and with external partners in industry and government. This can lead to the development of more effective and efficient toxicological testing methods and tools to screen chemicals for potential hazards and aid the development of environmentally friendly chemicals. Overall, the integration of CDS into the university curriculum will help prepare the next generation of scientists giving them a competitive edge to make considerable contributions to green chemistry, designing safer chemicals and non-animal testing methods. It will enable them to tackle modern challenges facing society including identifying safer and more sustainable chemicals and predicting the health and environmental impacts of novel chemical substances.}

abstract = {The 21st century era of rapidly changing technology entails cognizance of the changing nature of knowledge, learning and environments. New models of knowledge building and knowledge co-creation are emerging. Personalized learning takes on new dimensions with mobile devices and new tools for sharing and meta-thinking. Evidences from research in learning sciences and neurosciences point to the importance of understanding human cognition and behaviors in optimizing the use of technology for learning. Future learning entails a powerful use of the cognitive propensity to learn by imitation and modeling as well as the novelty of inquiry and creation. Didactics are replaced by conversational learning with social media as powerful platforms. Apart from the analytics and logic, future learning incorporates big picture thinking, multiple perspective thinking and connective thinking to flourish problem-solving and creativity. The address will conclude with some implications for design and practice.}
