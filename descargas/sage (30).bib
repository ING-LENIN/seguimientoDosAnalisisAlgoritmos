Core optimizations include the bit-fielding of integer data and iterative methods that complement a new Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) kernel, which efficiently calculates the matrix— vector products required by these iterative solution schemes. The new kernel performs the requisite 3-D DFTs as ensembles of 1-D transforms, and by doing so, is able to reduce the number of constituent 1-D transforms by 60% and the memory by over 80%. The optimizations also facilitate the use of parallel techniques to further enhance the performance. Complete OpenMP-based shared-memory and MPI-based distributed-memory implementations have been created to take full advantage of the various architectures. Several benchmarks of the new framework indicate extremely favorable performance and scalability.}

abstract = {Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is commonly associated with decision-making, neurocognitive impairments, and mood and motivational symptoms. However, their relationship may be obscured by traditional scoring methods. Objectives: To study the computational basis underlying decision-making impairments in MS and their interaction with neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric measures. Methods: Twenty-nine MS patients and 26 matched control subjects completed a computer version of the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). Participants underwent neurocognitive evaluation using an expanded version of the Brief Repeatable Battery. Hierarchical Bayesian Analysis was used to estimate three established computational models to compare parameters between groups. Results: Patients showed increased learning rate and reduced loss-aversion during decision-making relative to control subjects. These alterations were associated with: (1) reduced net gains in the IGT; (2) processing speed, executive functioning and memory impairments; and (3) higher levels of depression and current apathy. Conclusion: Decision-making deficits in MS patients could be described by the interplay between latent computational processes, neurocognitive impairments, and mood/motivational symptoms.}

We argue that one of the most divisive factors in psychological science is whether researchers choose to use computational modeling of theories (over and above data) during the scientific-inference process. Modeling is undervalued yet holds promise for advancing psychological science. The inherent demands of computational modeling guide us toward better science by forcing us to conceptually analyze, specify, and formalize intuitions that otherwise remain unexamined—what we dub open theory. Constraining our inference process through modeling enables us to build explanatory and predictive theories. Here, we present scientific inference in psychology as a path function in which each step shapes the next. Computational modeling can constrain these steps, thus advancing scientific inference over and above the stewardship of experimental practice (e.g., preregistration). If psychology continues to eschew computational modeling, we predict more replicability crises and persistent failure at coherent theory building. This is because without formal modeling we lack open and transparent theorizing. We also explain how to formalize, specify, and implement a computational model, emphasizing that the advantages of modeling can be achieved by anyone with benefit to all.}

abstract = {Small group researchers are increasingly called to engage the computational sciences. One challenge in answering this call is the lack of information concerning what the study of small groups looks like in these domains. This paper addresses this challenge through a prospecting review of research that computationally models or trains computers to learn small group and team behavior and is published in computing disciplines from 2016 to 2023. This review investigated how groups were modeled, for what purpose, what group elements were modeled, and whether social science informed the model design. Qualitative methods were used to analyze 119 published articles. Suggestions are presented for increasing the influence of small group research on the computational modeling of groups and teams, particularly for researchers with limited access to large research teams or resources. This review helps bridge the gap between small group research and computational sciences to advance the understanding of small groups and teams.}

abstract = {This study examines the effectiveness of a collaborative support method in enhancing programming learning outcomes in a serious game. The game Code Hasp was developed to facilitate the comparison between two support methods, worked examples and a collaborative peer support approach. A total of 111 elementary school students participated, divided into two groups. The experimental group received collaborative support from teammates alongside worked examples, while the control group relied solely on worked examples. Pre- and post-test results and in-game data revealed that the collaborative support method improved learning efficiency and problem-solving skills. A notable effect of the process was the emergence of a leadership role in most collaborative groups. The game’s support design and shared goal structure mitigate potential problems associated with unbalanced participation. These findings suggest that collaborative support systems in serious games are a promising strategy for promoting engagement and improving learning outcomes in programming education.}
