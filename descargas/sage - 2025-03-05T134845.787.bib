abstract = {There is a growing interest in data amongst small and medium enterprises (SMEs). This article looks at ways in which SMEs can combine their internal company data with open data, such as official statistics, and thereby enhance their business opportunities. Case studies are given as illustrations of the statistical and data-mining methods involved in such integrated data analytics. The article considers the barriers that prevent more SMEs from benefitting in this field and appraises some of the initiatives that are aimed at helping to overcome them. The discussion emphasizes the importance of bringing people together from the business, IT, and statistical worlds and suggests ways for statisticians to make a greater impact.}

abstract = {News organizations have adapted in various ways to a digital media environment dominated by algorithmic gatekeepers such as search engines and social networks. This article dissects a campaign to actively shape that environment led by professional fact-checking organizations. We trace the development of the Share the Facts “widget,” a device designed to give fact-checks greater purchase in algorithmically governed media networks by driving adoption of a new data standard called ClaimReview. We show how “structured journalism” gave journalists a language for the social and technical challenges involved, and how this infrastructural technology mediates between fact-checkers, audiences, and platform companies. We argue that this standard-setting initiative exhibits both promotional and disciplining facets, offering greater distribution and impact to journalists while also defining their work in specific ways. Crucially, in this case, this disciplining influence reflects internal professional-institutional agendas in an emerging subfield of journalism as much as the demands of platform companies.}

abstract = {In residual-effected homogeneous charge compression ignition, substantial exhaust-gas-recirculation is applied to limit the high rate of pressure rise from rapid combustion process. However, significant dilution, especially at low load, may lead to incomplete combustion and unstable operation. To improve the low-load-limit behavior, direct-fuel-injection during negative valve overlap was suggested by many researchers. Due to the high temperature and pressure conditions during negative valve overlap, the injected fuel experiences chemical reactions with trapped exhaust, referred to as recompression reaction. In this study, the possibility of the low-load-limit extension using this injection strategy during negative valve overlap is demonstrated from our previous experiments using isooctane fuel, and simulation with cycle-coupled, zero-dimensional homogeneous charge compression ignition engine model is conducted to understand the effects of recompression reaction. There are three major conclusions from our simulation. First, thermal consequence of the recompression reaction depends on the leftover oxygen in the trapped exhaust gas. Two equivalence ratios, 0.85 and 0.95, are tested in our simulation, and the overall recompression reaction is net-exothermic at 0.85, while net-endothermic at 0.95. Both conditions show significant fuel pyrolysis and reforming reactions during negative valve overlap, which are mostly endothermic, but sufficient oxidation reaction at 0.85 overcompensates for the endothermicity, leading to net-exothermicity in the end. Second, during the main compression stroke, the resultant fuel mixture from recompression reaction has overall higher specific heat ratio than the fresh fuel mixture in comparable operating conditions, which achieves higher mixture temperature rise at a given compression ratio and reaches ignition temperature earlier. Finally, in order to understand the chemical effect of the recompression reaction, ignition delays of the fuel mixture with or without recompression reaction are compared. The results show that the former has overall shorter ignition delay than the latter, which demonstrates overall improved ignitability of the fuel mixture by recompression reaction.}

abstract = {This research investigates route choice behavior in networks with risky travel times and real-time information. A stated preference survey is conducted. In it subjects use a PC-based interactive map to choose routes link by link in various scenarios. The scenarios include two types of maps: the first map presents a choice between one stochastic route and one deterministic route, and the second contains real-time information and an available detour. The first type of map measures the basic risk attitude of the subject. The second type allows for strategic planning and measures the effect of this opportunity on subjects’ choice behavior. Results from each subject are analyzed to determine whether the subject planned strategically for the en route information or simply selected fixed paths from origin to destination. The full data set is used to estimate several choice models with expected travel times and standard deviations as explanatory variables. Estimation results are used to assess whether models that incorporate strategic behavior more accurately reflect route choice than do simpler path-based models.}

abstract = {This article presents a study of what affects professional knowledge creation when journalism students have their periods of internship in legacy, yet highly digitized newsrooms. A total of 16 Norwegian j-students are interviewed and 30 internship reports analysed in order to detect the different actors – both humans and non-humans – that matter when students learn through practice in such newsrooms. Through this analysis, this article aims at understanding some of the tensions between legacy and digital culture that many newsrooms today are marked by and how these tensions affect professional knowledge creations for the journalists of tomorrow. The study is framed by sociomaterial perspectives on learning and journalistic practice and argues that two types of materiality are especially important for j-students’ professional knowledge creation during periods of internship: the structure and layout of the newsroom and the software applications in use at the newsroom.}

abstract = {Although schools are recognised as relevant actors in addressing the lack of skills of citizens for participating in Open Data ecosystems, educational approaches have not been clearly defined. In this paper, a design-based research methodological framework has been used to iteratively develop a learning design grounded in data literacy and real-world problem-solving to build Open Data competencies in elementary school. We conducted three cycles including five interventions in Danish schools with 117 pupils and nine teachers in 7th to 9th-grade. The first exploratory cycle provided contextual insights. The second cycle focused on designing an authentic game. The third cycle focused on supporting the Open Data competencies. We have iteratively developed The Open Data Newsroom, a role-playing game that immerses students in a data journalism process to solve a local environmental mystery with data. The results show how central design elements such as an authentic Open Data practice, local open data, physical and digital elements, and real-world complex problems support the development of Open Data skills, keeping students engaged, and creating an authentic experience in Open Data learning designs. The discussion section elaborates on how game-based and authentic learning approaches are central for integrating Open Data in elementary school education.}

abstract = {Compared with the traditional in-cylinder direct-injection spark ignition engine, the side-injection and side-spark-ignition characteristics of the two-stroke opposed-piston engine increase the ignition kernel offset and flame propagation distance. Increasing the flame propagation speed can to some extent solve the drawbacks caused by the non-central arrangement of spark plugs. The combustion chamber structure plays a crucial role in gas flow, fuel-charge mixing, and combustion characteristics. Therefore, three pistons were designed and comparatively analyzed in this study. The results show that: The pancake piston is beneficial to maintaining the intake swirl strength due to its simple and smooth spherical arc structure. The swirl strength of the pit and pit-guided piston decreases obviously, and the tumble strength can be maintained well. Compared to pancake and pit-guided pistons, the average TKE for the pit piston increased by approximately 25%, with a more concentrated distribution at the spark timing. The pancake piston exhibits the best scavenging performance, reducing the residual exhaust gas ratio by 2.1% and fresh air loss by 3.3% to the pit piston. A stable ignition core can be formed at the spark timing, but significant differences are observed in the flame propagation process for three pistons. Compared to the pit-guided piston, the pit piston has a 0.3% decrease in the indicated thermal efficiency, but a 13.1% decrease in combustion duration, which reduces knock tendency.}
