N2 - Computer methods can assist in understanding the behaviour of the individual components of a helmet, beyond merely the headform output as is usually done in a laboratory environment or for test-house certification purposes. This design study uses a method that we have previously used to analyse the effects of helmet liner material properties. While the helmet liner is of vital importance for energy absorption, other design modifications can also serve to improve its performance. The equestrian helmet model previously developed and analysed by the authors was used in this study. The helmet shell and geometric factors, such as a gap between the liner and shell, ventilation holes and ridges on the helmet liner were studied to observe their influence on helmet performance. By studying helmet design variations in terms of different variables other than headform linear acceleration, it is possible to determine which helmet configurations perform better, why they perform the way they do and how efficiently they perform. This can assist the product design and optimization process by suggesting models which would optimize cost, weight and helmet size.

N2 - In this article, the effective thermal conductivity of composites with a network structure as reinforcement was calculated using finite element method (FEM), and a tetrakaidecahedron configuration was employed to represent the network structure. A spectrum of effective thermal conductivity of these composites was simulated. An analytical relationship among the effective thermal conductivity Keff, intrinsic thermal conductivities of the matrix and network reinforcement phase, and the volume fraction of the network was developed by fitting the numerical results. The simulation results have been validated by comparing with previous published experimental ones, and excellent agreement has been achieved.

N2 - The debate over symbolic versus sub-symbolic representations of human cognition has been continuing for thirty years, with little indication of a resolution. The argument is this: Does the human cognitive system use symbols as a representation of knowledge, and does it process symbols and their respective constituents? Or does the human cognitive system use a distributed representation of knowledge, and is it somehow capable of processing this distributed representation of knowledge in a complex and meaningful way? This paper argues for an integrated symbolic and sub-symbolic approach to the representation of cognition. The lines of reasoning used as evidence to bolster this argument for an integrated approach are the cognitive architecture the Adaptive Character of Thought-Rational (ACT-R), and biology, where it is argued that symbolic and sub-symbolic representations of cognition are part of an intellectual continuum, with sub-symbolic representations at the low end and symbolic representations at the higher end.

N2 - The rising emphasis in schools on the explicit teaching of higher-level cogni tive skills has important implications for preservice teacher education programs. Action on this topic by teacher educators is important now for establishing a strong theoretical model for cognitive education in preservice programs, facul ty development plans for teacher educa tion faculty, new kinds of collaboration between SCDEs and the schools, coordi nation with arts and sciences faculty, re vision of existing courses in teacher edu cation, and a research agenda to study the relationship between instruction in higher-level thinking skills for future teachers and their implementation of those ideas in the classroom. Models for restructuring the teacher education program to include higher-order think ing skills are presented by Martin.

N2 - This study examined political advertisements placed by the Russian-based Internet Research Agency on Facebook and Instagram. Advertisements were computationally analyzed for four rhetorical techniques presumed to elicit anger and fear: negative identity-based language, inflammatory language, obscene language, and threatening language. Congruent with extant research on arousing emotional responses, advertising clickthrough rates were positively associated with inflammatory, obscene, and threatening language. Surprisingly, however, a negative relationship between clickthrough rate and the use of negative identity-based language was observed. Additional analyses showed that the advertisements were engaged with at rates that exceed industry benchmarks, and that clickthrough rates increased over time.

N2 - The flexion effect of a flexible wing during the hovering flight is systematically studied by using computer simulations when Reynolds number is kept at 140. The aerodynamic forces and flow vortex are investigated by solving the two-dimensional time-dependent incompressible Navier–Stokes equations using the finite volume method. The wing is modelled as a thin plate which has a rigid leading portion and a flexible aft part. The simulations are performed for a variation of the location of rotational centre and the amplitude of the flexion, and the corresponding changes of the aerodynamic forces and vortex shedding mechanism in the wake structure are investigated. Form the quantitative comparisons, the present simulations reveal that a moderate flexion during the hovering fly can provide a better performance for a flapping wing, while an excessive flexion will lead the aerodynamic performance become worse. Though the flexion does not change the force trace of the hovering wing, the magnitude of the instantaneous peak forces and mean periodic forces are definitely changed by the chordwise deformation. Compared with a rigid hovering wing, the dynamic flexion during hovering alters the intensity of the leading edge vorticity and the transfer direction of the wake. Here, the present results indicate that the aerodynamic forces can be altered by adding some deformation characteristics to the trailing edge of the wing. Furthermore, the appropriate flexion can be used to alter the aerodynamic performance of a wing and will be helpful for design and control of the flexible microflying vehicles.
