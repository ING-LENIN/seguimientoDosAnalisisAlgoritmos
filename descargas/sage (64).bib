abstract = {In this paper, we discuss a computational model that is able to detect and build word-like representations on the basis of sensory input. The model is designed and tested with a further aim to investigate how infants may learn to communicate by means of spoken language. The computational model makes use of a memory, a perception module, and the concept of “learning drive”. Learning takes place within a communicative loop between a “caregiver” and the “learner”. Experiments carried out on three European languages with different genetic background (Finnish, Swedish, and Dutch) show that a robust word representation can be learned in using less than 100 acoustic tokens (examples) of that word. The model is inspired by the memory structure that is assumed functional for human cognitive processing.}

abstract = {Abstract Are we close to a complete inventory of living processes so that we might expect in the near future to reproduce every essential aspect necessary for life? Or are there mechanisms and processes in cells and organisms that are presently inaccessible to us? Here I argue that a close examination of a particularly well-understood system— that of Escherichia coli chemotaxis— shows we are still a long way from a complete description. There is a level of molecular uncertainty, particularly that responsible for fine-tuning and adaptation to myriad external conditions, which we presently cannot resolve or reproduce on a computer. Moreover, the same uncertainty exists for any process in any organism and is especially pronounced and important in higher animals such as humans. Embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, immune recognition, memory formation, and survival in the real world, all depend on vast numbers of subtle variations in cell chemistry most of which are presently unknown or only poorly characterized. Overcoming these limitations will require us to not only accumulate large quantities of highly detailed data but also develop new computational methods able to recapitulate the massively parallel processing of living cells.}

abstract = {This article argues that agent-based modeling (ABM) is the methodological implication of Lawson’s championed ontological turn in economics. We single out three major properties of agent-based computational economics (ACE), namely, autonomous agents, social interactions, and the micro-macro links, which have been well accepted by the ACE community. We then argue that ACE does make a full commitment to the ontology of economics as proposed by Lawson, based on his prompted critical realism. Nevertheless, the article also points out the current limitations or constraints of ACE. Efforts to overcome them are deemed to be crucial before ACE can make itself more promising to the current ontological turn in economics.}

Practical optimization problems, a distributed solution approach, and specific characteristics of the situation are presented. This parallel system is then analyzed according to both approaches of computational complexity and scalability. To overcome the resulting drawbacks, the integration of a posteriori aspects is necessary. Thus, a generic metric is established providing a posteriori knowledge at early stages of the optimization process.}

abstract = {A widely advocated idea in education is that people learn better when the flow of experience is under their control (i.e., learning is self-directed). However, the reasons why volitional control might result in superior acquisition and the limits to such advantages remain poorly understood. In this article, we review the issue from both a cognitive and computational perspective. On the cognitive side, self-directed learning allows individuals to focus effort on useful information they do not yet possess, can expose information that is inaccessible via passive observation, and may enhance the encoding and retention of materials. On the computational side, the development of efficient “active learning” algorithms that can select their own training data is an emerging research topic in machine learning. This review argues that recent advances in these related fields may offer a fresh theoretical perspective on how people gather information to support their own learning.}

abstract = {With the development of society and the enhancement of people’s living standards, people are paying increasing attention to the safety and comfort of travel. Incorporating solar radiation blocking technology into heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems presents a fundamental solution to addressing cabin comfort issues. This paper reviews the recent research progress on evaluation methods, influencing factors, and strategies aimed at enhancing passenger comfort. Firstly, it provides a concise overview of objective methods employed for assessing thermal comfort, along with a summary of the factors that impact ride comfort. Secondly, human thermal models capable of responding to the physiological response mechanisms of the human body have been summarized. Thirdly, the factors influencing comfort in varying environments during winter and summer, along with methods to enhance ride comfort, have been emphasized. Finally, a brief overview of the multi-physics field coupling between computational fluid dynamics and cabin human thermophysiological models is presented. The paper underscores previous endeavors aimed at enhancing vehicle occupant comfort and identifies potential avenues for future academic research and commercialization.}

abstract = {The establishment of a healthy indoor environment requires the accurate evaluation of an individual’s exposure to pollutants. The concentration of indoor chemical pollutants is a representative indicator for such evaluation and is generally measured on-site. Moreover, material flow analysis (MFA), using macroscopic statistical data, is a reasonable method for objectively evaluating pollution on a wide scale; however, no effective strategy exists for the prediction of indoor air pollution, nor for the assessment of an individual’s exposure from social stock data. Accordingly, we developed a novel integration method comprising MFA and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with a computer-simulated person (CSP) to establish a framework for evaluating indoor pollutant concentration and individual exposure of residents. We focused on diethyl-hexyl phthalate (DEHP) and first estimated the amount of DEHP-containing product accumulation in Japan by MFA. Second, we conducted a thorough survey and measurement of DEHP emission rates. Using these results as boundary conditions for indoor CFD with CSP, the individual exposure of a resident, in a standard residential house, was quantitatively evaluated. The total daily exposure per unit of body weight was estimated to be more than 100 (μg/kg/d) in the worst-case scenario which was considered the upper limit for exposure in this analysis.}

abstract = {Objective. Sinus ventilation is often associated with sinusitis, a common condition causing significant pain and reduced quality of life. Clinical implications of the diverse anatomy of ostia connecting sinus to nose and the efficacy of surgical intervention in chronic sinusitis are poorly understood. This study aimed to measure sinus ventilation and explore variables in physical and mathematical models. Study Design. γ-Scintigraphy of krypton 81m (81mKr) was carried out in a stylized physical model of a human maxillary sinus. Computational simulations matched this model for validation and extrapolated to combinations of variables not possible experimentally for evaluation of transport mechanisms. Setting. Research laboratory in Department of Aeronautics. Imperial College London, and Department of Nuclear Medicine, Hammersmith Hospital, London. Methods. 81mKr distribution was measured with both single- and double-ostia sinuses. Computational simulations matched and extended the physical measurements and enabled separate identification and evaluation of transport mechanisms. Results. The presence of an additional ostium resulted in a 50-fold increase in the effective volume flow rate of gas replacement in the sinus. In the case of a single ostium, doubling the ostial diameter doubled the effective volume flow rate of gas exchange. Conclusion. γ-Scintigraphy of 81mKr enables quantitative assessment of effective volume flow rate in physical model sinuses. These flow rates obtained experimentally for single- and double-ostium sinuses match the computational predictions of matching geometries. The increased ventilation seen with an additional ostium or increased ostial diameters may not be clinically beneficial, because it could reduce nitric oxide concentration in the sinus.}

abstract = {Current theories of artificial intelligence (AI) generally exclude human emotions. The idea at the core of such theories could be described as ‘cognition is computing’; that is, that human psychological and symbolic representations and the operations involved in structuring such representations in human thinking and intelligence can be converted by AI into a series of cognitive symbolic representations and calculations in a manner that simulates human intelligence. However, after decades of development, the cognitive computing doctrine has encountered many difficulties, both in theory and in practice; in particular, it is far from approaching real human intelligence. Real human intelligence runs through the whole process of the emotions. The core and motivation of rational thinking are derived from the emotions. Intelligence without emotion neither exists nor is meaningful. For example, the idea of ‘hot thinking’ proposed by Paul Thagard, a philosopher of cognitive science, discusses the mechanism of the emotions in human cognition and the thinking process. Through an analysis from the perspectives of cognitive neurology, cognitive psychology and social anthropology, this article notes that there may be a type of thinking that could be called ‘emotional thinking’. This type of thinking includes complex emotional factors during the cognitive processes. The term is used to refer to the capacity to process information and use emotions to integrate information in order to arrive at the right decisions and reactions. This type of thinking can be divided into two types according to the role of cognition: positive and negative emotional thinking. That division reflects opposite forces in the cognitive process. In the future, ‘emotional computing’ will cause an important acceleration in the development of AI consciousness. The foundation of AI consciousness is emotional computing based on the simulation of emotional thinking.}
