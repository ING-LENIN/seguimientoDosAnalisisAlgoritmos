abstract = {We are developing a telemedicine application which offers automated diagnosis of facial (Bell’s) palsy through a Web service. We used a test data set of 43 images of facial palsy patients and 44 normal people to develop the automatic recognition algorithm. Three different image pre-processing methods were used. Machine learning techniques (support vector machine, SVM) were used to examine the difference between the two halves of the face. If there was a sufficient difference, then the SVM recognized facial palsy. Otherwise, if the halves were roughly symmetrical, the SVM classified the image as normal. It was found that the facial palsy images had a greater Hamming Distance than the normal images, indicating greater asymmetry. The median distance in the normal group was 331 (interquartile range 277–435) and the median distance in the facial palsy group was 509 (interquartile range 334–703). This difference was significant (P<0.001). The machine learning technique had an accuracy of more than 70%. Hence, the method may be suitable for clinical applications.}

abstract = {Shape change of the left atrium (LA) and LA appendage in atrial fibrillation (AF) patients is hypothesized to be linked to AF pathology and to play a role in thrombogenesis; however, many aspects of shape variation in the heart are poorly understood. To date, studies of the LA shape in AF have been limited to empirical observation and summary metrics, such as volume and its likeness to a sphere. This paper describes a more comprehensive approach to the study of the LA shape through the use of computationally derived statistical shape models. We describe practical approaches that we have developed to extract shape parameters automatically from the three-dimensional MR images of the patient. From these images and our techniques, we can produce a more comprehensive description of LA geometric variability than that has been previously possible. We present the methodology and results from two examples of specific analyses using shape models: (1) we describe statistically significant group differences between the normal control and AF patient populations (n = 137) and (2) we describe characteristic shapes of the LA appendage that are associated with the risk of thrombogenesis determined by transesophageal echocardiography (n = 203).}

abstract = {This paper introduces a graphical method SEE Repeated-measure data (SEER) to visually analyze data commonly collected in large-scale surveys, market research, biostatistics, and educational and psychological measurement. Many researchers in these disciplines encounter large amounts of data. Examples include the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) repeater scores, career paths of students graduated from college, essays scores in the writing assessments of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), and scores derived from different test equating methods in the discipline of psychometrics. Efficiency, ease-of-interpretations, applicability, user interactions are challenges due to the graphical complexity in visualizing large-scale data sets. To overcome these challenges, the author expands a systematic data-visualization technique, called SEER. The SEER technique was originally designed to depict career paths and occupational stability for professionals in the science and engineering discipline. In this paper, the author summarizes this example and highlights its applications in legal education, psychometrics, and other related areas. The author also, (a) expands this technique to examine repeat test takers’ scores, (b) illustrates how to monitor inter-rater consistency for essay scoring and for depicting multi-faceted data that involve human judgments, and (c) demonstrates how to investigate differences of test equating and scaling methodology using the SEER method. The broader impacts and design patterns of the SEER method are discussed.}

abstract = {How the boundaries of the mind should be drawn with respect to action and the material world is a core research question that cognitive archaeology shares with contemporary cognitive sciences.

Adopting the material engagement approach, I propose to replace the internalist vision of mentality, that is, the vision of a brain-bound mind that is using the body to execute and externalise preconceived mental plan through the stone, with an ecological-enactive vision of participatory mentality where bodily acts and materials act together to generate rather than merely execute thought processes. I argue that the latter participatory view changes the geography of the cognitive and offers a better description for the continuity of mind and matter that we see in the lithic record.}

abstract = {This paper presents a receding horizon methodology for trajectory tracking with safe collision conflict resolution for multiple autonomous vehicles. The proposed decentralized scheme is formulated in discrete-time domain where each vehicle’s objective function represents deviations from its desired trajectory. The safety constraints penalizing if two or more vehicles get closer than a prescribed safety distance are incorporated using avoidance functions. These avoidance functions are added to the objective functions to be minimized by each vehicle. They also represent the coupling elements in the decentralized scheme allowing for implicit coordination among the vehicles in the case of a possible collision. Vehicles are modeled by the unicycle model subject to bounds on both velocity and angular velocity. The optimization scheme performed by each vehicle uses a sequential quadratic programming method which is well suited for minimization of a scalar nonlinear function subject to nonlinear equality constraints (dynamic model) and multiple inequality constraints (velocity constraints and safety conditions). Outputs of the optimization process are kinematic control inputs for each vehicle. For symmetric cases where the gradient based methods are known to perform poorly (such as singular cases) a limit cycle method is implemented to modify segments of the desired trajectories leading to feasible solutions in terms of the optimization process performed by each vehicle.}

abstract = {In recent years, a considerable effort has been devoted towards the application of advanced techniques for turbomachinery efficient fluid dynamic control during operations. A novel strategy to dynamically modify and optimize the performance during operations takes advantage of shape memory alloys properties. Experimental and numerical analyses on a morphing polymeric blade for an automotive axial fan are presented. The blade shape change was achieved by shape memory alloys strips, thermomechanically treated, embedded in the blade and thermally activated by hot air stream flow. Measurement of fluid temperature, blade surface temperature pattern and three-dimensional shape change of the blade during activation was performed by means of an innovative image analysis technique in a purpose-built wind tunnel. Computational fluid dynamics numerical simulations were performed to study performance variations and three-dimensional fluid dynamic behavior of the fan originated from the shape memory effect.}
