N2 - Abstract An overview over flamelet modelling for turbulent non-premixed combustion is given. A short review of previous contributions to simulations of direct injection (DI) diesel engine combustion using the representative interactive flamelet concept is presented. A surrogate fuel consisting of 70 per cent (liquid volume) n-decane and 30 per cent α-methyl-naphthalene is experimentally compared to real diesel fuel. The resemblance of their physical and chemical properties is shown to result in very similar combustion and pollutant formation for both fuels. In order to account for variations of the scalar dissipation rate within the computational domain, a method using multiple flamelets, called the Eulerian particle flamelet model, is used. A strategy is described for subdividing the computational domain and assigning the resulting subdomains to different flamelet histories represented by Eulerian marker particles. Experiments conducted with an Audi DI diesel engine and diesel fuel are compared to simulations using the surrogate fuel. The use of multiple flamelets, each having a different history, significantly improves the description of the ignition phase, leading to a better prediction of pressure, heat release and exhaust emissions of soot and NOx. The effect of the number of flamelet particles on the predictions is discussed.

N2 - We study media representations of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In particular, we train models of semantic memory on a large number of news media outlets that published online articles during the course of the election. Based on the structure of word co-occurrence in these media outlets, our models learn semantic representations for the two presidential candidates as well as for widely studied personality traits. We find that models trained on media outlets most read by Clinton voters and media outlets most read by Trump voters differ in the strength of association between the two candidates’ names and trait words pertaining to morality. We observe some differences for trait words pertaining to warmth, but none for trait words pertaining to competence.

N2 - Current theory has divided memory into multiple systems, resulting in a fractionated account of human behaviour. By an alternative perspective, memory is a single system. However, debate over the details of different single-system theories has overshadowed the converging agreement among them, slowing the reunification of memory. Evidence in favour of dividing memory often takes the form of dissociations observed in amnesia, where amnesic patients are impaired on some memory tasks but not others. The dissociations are taken as evidence for separate explicit and implicit memory systems. We argue against this perspective. We simulate two key dissociations between classification and recognition in a computational model of memory, A Theory of Nonanalytic Association. We assume that amnesia reflects a quantitative difference in the quality of encoding. We also present empirical evidence that replicates the dissociations in healthy participants, simulating amnesic behaviour by reducing study time. In both analyses, we successfully reproduce the dissociations. We integrate our computational and empirical successes with the success of alternative models and manipulations and argue that our demonstrations, taken in concert with similar demonstrations with similar models, provide converging evidence for a more general set of single-system analyses that support the conclusion that a wide variety of memory phenomena can be explained by a unified and coherent set of principles.

N2 - Various investigations on open rotor (OR) hovering in-ground effect (IGE) are carried out, but few papers report shrouded rotor (SR) hovering IGE. This paper compares aerodynamic performance and flowfield characteristics of OR and SR hovering IGE by both experimental measurements and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations. Experimental results reveal that in IGE flight, the aerodynamic performance of SR is more sensitive than that of OR. And at constant power, SR offers more thrust than OR at the same ground distance. Ground has a great influence on thrust for OR below 2.2 rotor radius distance, while for SR it shows obvious effect below 1.5 rotor radius distance. It is also shown that normalized aerodynamic coefficients of OR and SR are independent on rotor speed. In addition, for OR the rotor thrust coefficient changes nearly linearly with the logarithmic distance from ground, while for SR it changes nonlinearly. Flowfield analysis by CFD shows that shroud changes the tip flow features and expands the slipstream area of SR. When ground distance gets small, back pressure below the rotor-disk plane increases, which is more obvious for SR than OR. Furthermore, shroud thrust of SR decreases because of tip leakage flow and flow separation.

N2 - Snow-drifting disasters frequently occur in snowy regions with strong winds and can cause traffic interruptions. Cuttings are particularly vulnerable to severe snowdrift disasters, making designing cutting sections in regions prone to drifting snow challenging. To address this issue, a series of Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were conducted to study the impact of cutting section parameters on snowdrift development in cuttings with varying depths and slopes. Initially, the wind velocity and wall friction velocity were carefully analyzed in the initial state of the cutting. The evolution process of snow distribution in different cuttings was then compared. Furthermore, the influence of parameters on wind velocity development was analyzed. Based on the flow patterns and snow distribution, cuttings involved in drifting snow disasters can be divided into two types, depending on whether there are vortices in the cutting. When the slope gradient changes from 1/1 to 1/2, the flow in the cutting will not separate and reattach, indicating that the critical slope angle for two types of cutting is 27°. As the slope gradient decreases, the leeward drift will move from the area near the crest to the foot of the slope. Increasing the depth of the cutting not only reduces the accumulation of snow on the road surface but also provides scope to improve the safety reserve capacity of the slopes.

N2 - Objectives: This study proposes a computational model to evaluate patient room design layout and features that contribute to patient stability and mitigate the risk of fall. Background: While common fall risk assessment tools in nursing have an acceptable level of sensitivity and specificity, they focus on intrinsic factors and medications, making risk assessment limited in terms of how the physical environment contributes to fall risk. Methods: We use literature to inform a computational model (algorithm) to define the relationship between these factors and the risk of fall. We use a trajectory optimization approach for patient motion prediction. Results: Based on available data, the algorithm includes static factors of lighting, flooring, supportive objects, and bathroom doors and dynamic factors of patient movement. This preliminary model was tested using four room designs as examples of typical room configurations. Results show the capabilities of the proposed model to identify the risk associated with different room layouts and features. Conclusions: This innovative approach to room design evaluation and resulting estimation of patient fall risk show promise as a proactive evidence-based tool to evaluate the relationship of potential fall risk and room design. The development of the model highlights the challenge of heterogeneity in factors and reporting found in the studies of patient falls, which hinder our understanding of the role of the built environment in mitigating risk. A more comprehensive investigation comparing the model with actual patient falls data is needed to further refine model development.

N2 - Abstract Numerical simulation of three-dimensional dynamic stall (DS) of helicopter rotor blades has been undertaken using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on the Navier-Stokes equations. The CFD method has been carefully validated against experimental data before being used to study the topology of the three-dimensional DS vortex and the effects of yaw and rotation on its shape and trajectory. The three-dimensional unsteady viscous computations were found to give a wealth of results at the expense of significant amounts of CPU time. To alleviate this problem and to develop a faster model for the aerodynamic loads encountered during three-dimensional DS, a neural network (NN) was put forward. The NN was trained using both CFD and experimental data and was subsequently used as a method for interpolating DS loads between known states for which CFD data were available. The NN was found to work well for such interpolations, although its capability to extrapolate outside the training envelope was somehow limited. Nevertheless, the NN was found to be a very efficient technique for reconstructing three-dimensional DS and has demonstrated great potential as a method for reducing non-linear aerodynamics to a simple computational model.

N2 - Applied behavior analysis (ABA) is a behavioral science that aims to teach specific and socially relevant behaviors to people with different repertoires. Technology can aid behavior analysis interventions supporting different educational agents (e.g. psychologists, parents, and teachers) as well as patients. In this article, we reviewed how researchers are using technology in ABA interventions with children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We present the results obtained from a systematic review of the literature. The purpose was to map the employment of the computational technology in ABA interventions, as well as to discuss the primary technologies used, their benefits, and their limitations. Based on our review, we noticed that technology-based interventions are in the early stages of development. We evidenced it by the methodological limitations in many of the studies we found, and the relatively simplistic nature of many of the technological applications (e.g. inability to customize the software to meet individual learner needs). We also provide suggestions, based on these findings, for how researchers may advance the studies in this area to improve the lives of children with ASD and their families.
