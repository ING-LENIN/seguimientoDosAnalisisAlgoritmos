N2 - This paper describes a method to tailor computational design algorithms to evaluate human-centric outputs in architectural projects by presenting a case study that evaluates teamwork affordance for primary care clinics. We argue that computational design assessment techniques fall short of evaluating those human experiences that stem from multiple interactions between individuals and the surrounding environment. This research suggests that future computational design algorithms could benefit from incorporating scenario-based methods developed in the field of evidence-based design, in which studies are concerned about improving qualitative goals. Through this case study, we describe the process of prototyping a computational design algorithm based on the Functional Scenario Analysis approach, applying the algorithm to evaluate case studies, visualizing findings, and extracting design strategies based on the analysis results. This method offers a new vision of how computational design can benefit informed decision-making processes and generate design alternatives aligned with a project’s design goals.

N2 - Hydraulic conductivity (k) is critical for designing permeable pavements for safety and environmental reasons. A novel approach for estimating k is through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applied to permeable asphalt (PA). Specimens of PA are examined in this study to evaluate CFD applicability. Tortuosity, effective porosity, pore size distribution, and specific surface area were determined based on three-dimensional specimen structures reconstructed using x-ray tomography analyses. Using CFD, estimates of k were determined and compared with physical measurements and also with the results obtained from the semi-empirical modified Kozeny-Carman model (KCM). The comparison shows that the numerical simulations with CFD can be a reasonable tool for estimating k and for examining transport of water through PA. Within the constraints of this study, results infer that CFD can provide more representative results for low k in comparison with KCM. For higher k, CFD and KCM results were reasonably comparable.

N2 - Advancements in robotic technology are making it increasingly possible to integrate robots into the human workspace in order to improve productivity and decrease worker strain resulting from the performance of repetitive, arduous physical tasks. While new computational methods have significantly enhanced the ability of people and robots to work flexibly together, there has been little study of the ways in which human factors influence the design of these computational techniques. In particular, collaboration with robots presents unique challenges related to the preservation of human situational awareness and the optimization of workload allocation for human teammates while respecting their workflow preferences. We conducted a series of human subject experiments to investigate these human factors, and provide design guidelines for the development of intelligent collaborative robots based on our results.

N2 - This paper aims to investigate how the trade-offs involved in the construction and solution of restrictive master problems for the user equilibrium traffic assignment problem may affect the overall convergence performance of the solution algorithms. Three strategies used to update user equilibrium path sets in path-based algorithms are examined: an origin–destination (O-D)-based strategy that updates the path set for each single O-D pair just before path flows are updated, an origin-based strategy that updates path sets for all O-D pairs associated with the same origin at once, and a simultaneous strategy that updates the path sets for all O-D pairs together. Three recently developed path-based algorithms to update the path sets by using three strategies are implemented for solution of the restrictive master problems. The implementation strategies are tested on medium to large real networks, and their relative performance characteristics are compared. The results show that the construction and update of the restrictive master problems by the different strategies have significant impacts on convergence as well as solution noise. The computational time for convergence under the simultaneous and origin-based strategies is significantly less than that under the O-D-based strategy. In addition, the solution obtained by adoption of the simultaneous strategy exhibits less noise than the other two strategies. These results provide important theoretical and practical insights into solution algorithms for the traffic assignment problem.

N2 - An 18% scale semispan model is used as a platform for examining the efficacy of microphone array processing using synthetic data from numerical simulations. Two hybrid Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes/Large-Eddy-Simulation (RANS/LES) codes coupled with Ffowcs Williams–Hawkings solvers are used to calculate 97 microphone signals at the locations of an array employed in the NASA Langley Research Center 14 × 22 tunnel. Conventional, DAMAS, and CLEAN-SC array processing is applied in an identical fashion to the experimental and computational results for three different configurations involving deploying and retracting the main landing gear and a part-span flap. Despite the short time records of the numerical signals, the beamform maps are able to isolate the noise sources, and the appearance of the DAMAS synthetic array maps is generally better than those from the experimental data. The experimental CLEAN-SC maps are similar in quality to those from the simulations indicating that CLEAN-SC may have less sensitivity to background noise. The spectrum obtained from DAMAS processing of synthetic array data is nearly identical to the spectrum of the center microphone of the array, indicating that for this problem array processing of synthetic data does not improve spectral comparisons with experiment. However, the beamform maps do provide an additional means of comparison that can reveal differences that cannot be ascertained from spectra alone.

N2 - The purpose of this study is to analyse the differences in the combustion process, and pollutants formation (especially soot) due to top-hat and boot injection-rate shapes at one specific high-load point of a single-cylinder small-bore diesel engine using multidimensional engine simulations. The simulations are performed using a response interactive flamelet model with detailed chemical kinetics. A detailed chemistry-based soot model is used for the prediction of soot emissions. The heights of the first and second stages of the boot shape are varied to observe the effect of the injected fuel mass distribution. In addition, results of boot shapes are compared with a trapezoidal (top-hat) shape. A detailed analysis of soot formation and oxidation is also presented for some selected rate shapes. Through computational analysis it is shown that the boot shapes have the potential to decrease combustion-generated noise and to lower emissions at the investigated load point compared to the top-hat shape. Variations in the temporal distribution of the injected fuel mass show that a lower height of the first stage and a higher height of the second stage of the boot shape result in a relatively slower rise of heat release (lower combustion-generated noise) in the early part of combustion and enhanced soot oxidation as a result of higher spray momentum near the end of injection.

N2 - Focus groups were convened in 2005 and 2013 as the first step in successive MPA curriculum review and revision processes. Although the criteria for selecting participants and the questions posed to the groups were similar, the focus groups generated dramatically different perspectives regarding the challenges confronting administrators. An analysis indicates that the differences in focus group perspectives are a reflection of the evolving economic, political and fiscal environments. It also reinforces the need to adopt instructional strategies that cultivate the students’ creative, critical thinking and life-long learning skills. Since anchored learning maximizes the probability of achieving these outcomes, this article provides three examples of implementation.

N2 - Kinship is a fundamental feature and basis of human societies. We describe a set of computational tools and services, and the logic that underlies these, developed to improve how we understand both the fundamental facts of kinship and how people use kinship as a resource in their lives. Mathematical formalism applied to cultural concepts is more than an exercise in model building, as it provides a way to represent and explore their logical consistency and implications. Not surprisingly, kinship terminologies are particularly amenable to formal representation. Researchers throughout the history of kinship studies have noted the logicality of kinship terminology systems. The logic is explored here through the kin term computations made by users of a terminology when computing the kinship relation one person has to another by referring to a third person for whom each has a kin term relationship. Kinship Algebra Modeler provides a set of tools, services, and an architecture to explore kinship terminologies and their properties in an accessible manner.

N2 - This research quantitatively investigates the impact of violence on the propagation of images in social media in the context of political protest. Using a computational approach, we measure the relative violence of a large set of images shared on Twitter during the protests against the G20 summit in Frankfurt am Main in 2017. This allows us to investigate if more violent content is shared more times and faster than less violent content on Twitter, and if different online communities can be characterized by the level of violence of the visual content they share. The results show that the level of violence in an image tweet does not correlate with the number of retweets and mentions it receives that the time to retweet is marginally lower for image tweets containing a high level of violence and that the level of violence in image tweets differs between communities.
