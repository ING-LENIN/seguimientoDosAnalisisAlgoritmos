N2 - Cancer is a complex disease characterized by a wide array of mutually interacting components constituting the tumor microenvironment (connective tissue, vascular system, immune cells), many of which are targeted therapeutically. In particular, immune checkpoint inhibitors have recently become an established part of the treatment of cancer. Despite great promise, only a portion of the patients display durable response. Current research efforts are concentrated on the determination of tumor-specific biomarkers predictive of response, such as tumor mutational burden, microsatellite instability, and neo-antigen presentation. However, it is clear that several additional characteristics pertaining to the tumor microenvironment play a critical role in the effectiveness of immunotherapy. Here we comment on the computational methods that are used for the analysis of the tumor microenvironment components from transcriptomic data, discuss the critical needs, and foresee potential evolutions in the field.

N2 - Background Septal deviation is an extremely common anatomic variation in healthy adults. However, there are no standard criteria to determine when a deviated septum is clinically relevant. Presently, selection of patients for septoplasty is based on mostly clinical examination, which is prone to observer bias and may lead to unsuccessful treatment. The objective of this article is twofold. First, we investigate whether the location of a septal deviation within the nasal passages affects nasal resistance. Second, we test whether computer simulations are consistent with rhinomanometry studies in predicting that anterior septal deviations increase nasal resistance more than posterior deviations. Methods A three-dimensional computational model of a healthy nose was created from computed tomography scans. Geometry-deforming software was used to produce models with septal deviations. Computational fluid dynamics techniques were used to simulate nasal airflow and compute nasal resistance. Results Our results revealed that the posterior nasal cavity can accommodate significant septal deviations without a substantial increase in airway resistance. In contrast, a deviation in the nasal valve region more than doubled nasal resistance. These findings are in good agreement with the rhinomanometry literature and with the observation that patients with anterior septal deviations benefit the most from septoplasty. Conclusions In the model, anterior septal deviations increased nasal resistance more than posterior deviations. This suggests, in agreement with the literature, that other causes of nasal obstruction (dysfunction of the nasal valve, allergy, etc.) should be carefully considered in patients with posterior septal deviations because such deviations may not affect nasal resistance. This study illustrates how computational modeling and virtual manipulation of the nasal geometry are useful to investigate nasal physiology.

N2 - Digital technology offers new possibilities for children to play, express themselves, learn, and communicate. A recent development in online practice is a shift toward youth engaged in computer programming online communities. Programming is argued to be the new literacy of the millennium. In this article, I examine the use of Scratch, an online programming community, as a means to support digital literacy for early adolescent gifted, talented, and creative students. In addition, I share the experiences of an early adolescent gifted student with Scratch and consider the use of Scratch to promote interdisciplinary curricular concepts.

N2 - We show that the popular pencil puzzle NURIKABE is intractable from the computational complexity point of view, that is, it is NP-complete, even when the involved numbers are 1 and 2 only. To this end, we show how to simulate Boolean gates by the puzzle under consideration. Moreover, we also study some NURIKABE variants, which remain NP-complete, too.

N2 - This paper describes the use of computational fluid dynamics in teaching graduate students who were in a four‐year B. Tech program. Many of these students did not have a good background in mathematics, fluid dynamics, heat transfer, and programming; however, most of them were good at computer‐aided design in ProE and were very interested in learning computational fluid dynamics as a design tool in industries. Solidworks flow simulator was chosen as the computational fluid dynamics software to teach students the entire computational fluid dynamics process in a single integrated software environment. Based on projects, computational fluid dynamics numerical methods and fundamentals of heat transfer and fluid flow were introduced to help students understand the computational fluid dynamics process, interpret, and validate simulation results. The computational fluid dynamics simulation of an orifice meter is given as the basic example for the students. Orifice meters are the most common equipment used for measuring fluid flow because of their simple mechanical structure, versatility, and low cost. In this paper, computational fluid dynamics simulation has been used to predict the orifice flow with better accuracy. Computational fluid dynamics simulations have been performed using solidworks flow simulator and validated with the data available in published literature. A new system has been proposed to accurately measure the flow using orifice metering systems.

N2 - This study investigates pronoun interpretation by second language (L2) learners of English, focusing on whether first language (L1) transfer and/or processing difficulty affect L2 learners’ pronoun resolution. It is hypothesized that L2 learners’ non-target performance in L2-pronoun interpretation is attributable to two sources. The first is the computational complexity required for pronoun resolution, as argued in L1 acquisition by Grodzinsky and Reinhart and L2 acquisition by Slabakova et al. The second is how pronoun interpretation operates in L1. The hypothesis is tested by comparing Korean and Spanish L2-English learners’ interpretation of English pronouns using a Truth Value Judgment Task. Both groups had difficulty rejecting pronouns with local-referential antecedents when their proficiency levels were low. Additionally, Korean speakers showed more non-target responses than Spanish speakers due to their knowledge of pronoun interpretation in Korean. These results indicate that both L1 transfer and processing difficulty may be sources of L2 learners’ non-target pronoun interpretation, supporting the hypothesis of the study.

N2 - This article aims to present a two-dimensional parametric analysis of a modified Savonius wind turbine using computational fluid dynamics. The effects of three independent parameters of the rotor, namely, shape factor, overlap ratio, and tip speed ratio on turbine performance were studied and then optimized for maximum coefficient of performance using response surface methodology. The rotor performance was analyzed over specific domains of the parameters under study, and three-variable Box-Behnken design was used for design of experiment. The specific parametric combinations as per design of experiment were simulated using ANSYS Fluent®, and the response variable, coefficient of performance (Cp), was calculated. The sliding mesh model was utilized, and the flow was simulated using Shear Stress Transport (SST) k − ω model. The model was validated using past experimental results and found to predict parametric effects accurately. Minitab® and ReliaSoft DOE++® were used to develop regression equation and find the optimum combination of parameters for coefficient of performance over the specified parametric domains using response surface methodology.

N2 - Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is an indispensable simulation tool for predicting the emission of pollutants in the work environment. Welding is one of the most common industrial processes that might expose the operators and surrounding workers to certain hazardous gaseous metal fumes. In the present study, we used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodology for simulating the emission of iron fumes from the shielded metal arc welding (SMAW) procedure. A galvanized steel chamber was fabricated to measure the pollutant concentration and identify the size of the fume created by the SMAW. Then, the emission of welding aerosol was simulated using a method of computational fluid-particle dynamics with the ANSYS 2020 R1 software. The highest amount of welding fumes concentration was related to iron fumes (i.e., 3045 μg/m3 with a diameter of 0.25 μm). The results of the current study indicated that the local exhaust and general ventilation system can prevent the spreading of welding fumes to the welder’s breathing zone and the surrounding environment. CFD was also found to be an efficient method for predicting the emission of the iron fumes created by SMAW as well as for selecting an appropriate ventilation system. However, further studies that take the modeling of welding-generated emission of additional metal particles and gases into account will need to be undertaken.

N2 - Constructionism is at once a learning epistemology, a theory of learning, and a pedagogical approach that literally places education in the hands of learners. Constructionism situates students and mentors together in student-directed, project-oriented environments, often enabled with state-of-the-art computational technologies, to foster playful exploration and experimentation. Over time, shared learning experiences in constructionist environments may lead to the formation of learning cultures. To orient the design of constructionist environments for designers of engineering design education, this paper provides a historical context for Seymour Papert’s development of constructionism and distinguishes it from Jean Piaget’s philosophy of constructivism. Constructionism is introduced as an effort targeted at the reform of traditional education. Examples of constructionist environments for learning are then provided. The applicability of constructionism for the design of learning environments for engineering design is also discussed and observations are given for designing the tools, strategies, and activities that comprise constructionist learning environments for engineering design education.

N2 - We present results obtained with new instrumental methods for the acoustic analysis of prosody to evaluate prosody production by children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Typical Development (TD). Two tasks elicit focal stress — one in a vocal imitation paradigm, the other in a picture-description paradigm; a third task also uses a vocal imitation paradigm, and requires repeating stress patterns of two-syllable nonsense words. The instrumental methods differentiated significantly between the ASD and TD groups in all but the focal stress imitation task. The methods also showed smaller differences in the two vocal imitation tasks than in the picture-description task, as was predicted. In fact, in the nonsense word stress repetition task, the instrumental methods showed better performance for the ASD group. The methods also revealed that the acoustic features that predict auditory-perceptual judgment are not the same as those that differentiate between groups. Specifically, a key difference between the groups appears to be a difference in the balance between the various prosodic cues, such as pitch, amplitude, and duration, and not necessarily a difference in the strength or clarity with which prosodic contrasts are expressed.
