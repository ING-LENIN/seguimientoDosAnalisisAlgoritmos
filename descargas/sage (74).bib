abstract = {The selection of coals for pulverised coal injection usually consists of evaluating the carbonaceous matter. However, the reduction of permeability in the lower section of the blast furnace with high rates of pulverised coal injection can be associated with remaining ashes from the coal combustion process. The aim of this work is to evaluate the behaviour of coal ashes at high temperatures in relation to their chemical and mineralogical composition. These ashes were submitted to the following analysis: chemical (X-ray fluorescence), mineralogical (X-ray diffraction), fusibility (heating microscopy) and viscosity (rotational viscometer). The software FactSage was also used to evaluate the behaviour of coal ashes. It was observed that samples present different chemical and mineralogical compositions, reflecting in the fusibility and viscosity of ashes. Their proportions and relevant phases were determined by computational thermodynamics and also related to the experimental work.}

abstract = {In this wide-ranging conversation, Berry and Galloway explore the implications of undertaking media theoretical work for critiquing the digital in a time when networks proliferate and, as Galloway claims, we need to ‘forget Deleuze’. Through the lens of Galloway’s new book, Laruelle: Against the Digital, the potential of a ‘non-philosophy’ for media is probed. From the import of the allegorical method from excommunication to the question of networks, they discuss Galloway’s recent work and reflect on the implications of computation for media theory, thinking about media objects, and critical theory.}

abstract = {All over the world, the oil and gas industries are the most important source of energy. The likelihood of subsea gas and oil leakage is increasing, which can cause threats and harmful impacts on the marine environment and potentially catastrophic events such as fires, explosives, and the loss of structural integrity of subsea infrastructure. Also, Physical models have usually been used to predict sea currents, but they are unstable to disturbances and hence incorrect over long periods of time. Machine learning approaches are more resistant than the physical models that have usually been used to predict sea currents. Also, Physical models have usually been used to predict sea currents. Nonetheless, they are not stable to disturbances and thus are not correct for long periods of time. Machine learning approaches are more resistant than the physical models that have usually been used to predict sea currents. Machine learning approaches are more resistant to change and perturbation. Therefore, the goal of this research is to assess the potential of hazards of the gas plume from subsea pipeline rupture till reaching the sea surface by changing the influence parameters on gas plume to assist petroleum companies in developing risk assessment strategies by assessing and simulating subsea gas release in order to contain the leakage by developing coupling models one for machine learning code which can predict the upcoming water current speed by using Multiple Linear Regression algorithm and hooked it by UDF to a second model which implements Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) model to study subsea gas release under current effects. Engebretsen’s Rotvoll experiment data is being used to validate the numerical computational fluid dynamics model. The rising time and fountain height and horizontal migration for gas release are the essential factors to be considered while evaluating the gas dispersion through our study by changing the influencing parameters such as leakage hole sizes, water current speeds, gas velocity, and water depths in the presence of water current in all cases. Also, applied our simulation to real case parameters for one of the Egyptian Petroleum Companies. These findings might aid in evaluating the hazards and response planning in the event of subsea gas leakage.}

abstract = {Observation is at the center of all biological sciences. Advances in imaging technologies are therefore essential to derive novel biological insights to better understand the complex workings of living systems. Recent high-throughput sequencing and imaging techniques are allowing researchers to simultaneously address complex molecular variations spatially and temporarily in tissues and organs. The availability of increasingly large dataset sizes has allowed for the evolution of robust deep learning models, designed to interrogate biomedical imaging data. These models are emerging as transformative tools in diagnostic medicine. Combined, these advances allow for dynamic, quantitative, and predictive observations of entire organisms and tissues. Here, we address 3 main tasks of bioimage analysis, image restoration, segmentation, and tracking and discuss new computational tools allowing for 3-dimensional spatial genomics maps. Finally, we demonstrate how these advances have been applied in studies of craniofacial development and oral disease pathogenesis.}

We investigate the performance of a finite-difference computational fluid dynamics algorithm on a massively parallel computer, the Connection Machine. Of special interest is an implicit time-stepping algorithm; to obtain maximum perfor mance from the Connection Machine, it is necessary to use a nonstandard algorithm to solve the linear systems that arise in the implicit algorithm. We find that the Connection Machine can achieve very high computation rates on both explicit and implicit algorithms. The per formance of the Connection Machine puts it in the same class as today’s most powerful conventional supercomputers.}

abstract = {In recent years, the use of machine learning-based surrogate models for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations has emerged as a promising technique for reducing the computational cost associated with engine design optimization. However, such methods still suffer from drawbacks. One main disadvantage is that the default machine learning (ML) hyperparameters are often severely suboptimal for a given problem. This has often been addressed by manually trying out different hyperparameter settings, but this solution is ineffective in case of a high-dimensional hyperparameter space. Besides this problem, the amount of data needed for training is also not known a priori. In response to these issues that need to be addressed, the present work describes and validates an automated active learning approach, AutoML-GA, for surrogate-based optimization of internal combustion engines. In this approach, a Bayesian optimization technique is used to find the best machine learning hyperparameters based on an initial dataset obtained from a small number of CFD simulations. Subsequently, a genetic algorithm is employed to locate the design optimum on the ML surrogate surface. In the vicinity of the design optimum, the solution is refined by repeatedly running CFD simulations at the projected optima and adding the newly obtained data to the training dataset. It is demonstrated that AutoML-GA leads to a better optimum with a lower number of CFD simulations, compared to the use of default hyperparameters. The proposed framework offers the advantage of being a more hands-off approach that can be readily utilized by researchers and engineers in industry who do not have extensive machine learning expertise.}

Method With the use of computational fluid mechanics software we simulated blood flow in 3 D models of the internal jugular veins that exhibited different morphologies, including nozzle-like strictures in their upper parts and valves in the lower parts. Results In a majority of models with nozzle-like strictures, especially those positioned asymmetrically, abnormal flow pattern was revealed, with significant flow separation and regions with reversed flow. Abnormal valves had no significant impact on flow in a case of already altered flow evoked by stricture in upper part of the vein. Conclusions In our jugular model, cranially-located stenoses, which in clinical practice are primarily caused by external compression, cause more significant outflow impact respect to endoluminal defects and pathological valves located more caudally.}

abstract = {A theoretical computational method to evaluate the performance characteristics of cycloidal propellers is presented. Starting from Taniguchi’s method, improvements have been derived to make it applicable for various eccentricities in the whole advance coefficient region. First the effect of the curved orbit of the blades and the blade rotation is taken into account, that influences camber and zero lift angle. Then the effect of low Reynolds number on drag coefficient and the effect of stalling on lift coefficient are analysed and discussed in detail. Some linearizations are given up to improve the computation accuracy. The improved method is described. Using this improved method to compute the performance of a DTNSRDC model and comparing the results with systematic experiment results (see DTNSRDC Report 2983), it is shown that the agreement between them is quite good for a larger range of advance ratios and eccentricities.}
