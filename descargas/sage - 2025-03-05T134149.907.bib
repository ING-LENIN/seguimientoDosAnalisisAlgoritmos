abstract = {There are two conflicting views about the nature of thought: it is invariably rational or invariably irrational. Bartlett argued that thinking is a high level skill, and this idea suggests an obvious third possibility: thought is sometimes rational and sometimes irrational. This view is defended in the present paper, which argues that the doctrine of logical infallibility is either falsified by the results of some experiments on syllogistic reasoning or else empirically vacuous. There is no need to postulate a mental logic of the sort that Piaget and others have proposed. The rapid implicit inferences of daily life depend on the ability to interpret sentences by constructing mental models of the states of affairs that they describe. Deliberate deductions depend on the further ability to search for alternative models that violate putative conclusions. All that you need to know to assess validity is the fundamental semantic principle of deduction: an inference is valid if, and only if, its conclusion is true in every situation in which its premises are true and there is no way of interpreting the premises so as to render the conclusion false. This principle guides the construction of all logics though it is not explicitly stated in any of them. The paper concludes by examining the ways in which people differ in their ability to reason, the practical need to improve this ability, and some of the pedagogical implications of the present studies.}

abstract = {With emergent subspecialties like data journalism bringing new skillsets and job roles, professionals and journalism educators find it difficult to imbibe the fast-changing industry demands. Such challenges in some countries and media industries put journalism educators in an advantageous position, offering them an agency to actively shape the contours of industry practice than getting shaped by it. From this perspective, the present study tries to understand data journalism practices in India and suggests certain insights to integrate data journalism training in programmes offered by Indian journalism education. By probing insights from the literature on data journalism education and by examining existing data journalism practices in India, the study calls for intervention with a pedagogic strategy to impart better data-sourcing practices, coding skills and critical data literacy among the students as an antidote to the prevalent DIY culture and overdependence on data aggregates. The pedagogic strategy should convey the importance of audience centrality and ethics in data journalism practice. It argues that such an approach can, in effect, improve industry practices as well as the quality of journalism education in India.}

abstract = {As digital platforms have come to play a central role in the news and information ecosystem, a new realm of watchdog journalism has emerged – the platform beat. Journalists on the platform beat report on the operation, use and misuse of social media platforms and search engines. The platform beat can serve as an important mechanism for increasing the accountability of digital platforms, in ways that can affect public trust in the platforms, but that can also, hopefully, lead to the development of stronger, more reliable, and ultimately more trustworthy, platforms. However, there are a number of tensions, vulnerabilities and potential conflicts of interest that characterize the platform beat. This article explores these complex dynamics of the platform beat in an effort assess the capacity of those on the platform beat to enhance the accountability and trustworthiness of digital platforms.}

abstract = {The teaching of statistics to psychology undergraduates has traditionally included formulae and methods for conducting statistical tests without the aid of a computer. Does this requirement to master the formulae encourage deeper understanding or merely provoke anxiety? The relationship between competence in calculation and statistical thinking was examined using questions from an exam set at the end of a compulsory first year module. In addition, scores on a premodule test and coursework grades were recorded, and used to control for prior ability and learning effort. The control variables jointly accounted for 26% of the variance in statistical thinking, whereas calculation accounted for only a further 2%. The contribution made by competence in calculation, though statistically significant, was not large.}

abstract = {Resistivity maps for Si wafers processed using BN solid sources and hydrogen injection were compared to convective flow patterns predicted computationally. The convective flow patterns were found to mirror the resistivity maps, with low velocity flow domains being associated with high resistivity regions on the wafer and high velocity flow with low resistivity regions. Subtle changes in both the flow patterns and resistivity maps as a function of location within the furnace were consistently reflected in both computed flow domains and measured resistitivies. Finally, axially eccentric placement of the wafer–source stack was found to promote convection between wafer–source pairs by as much as a factor of five.}

Algorithms for segmenting arm movements into pieces are proposed. It is suggested that for a large class of arm movements recognition could be reliably achieved based only on the description of the hand shape and path in the body coordinates, without needing the detailed description of the variation of all the joint angles of the arm.}

abstract = {This paper describes a module for the teaching of diffusion to mechanical engineering students that can be part of a course on numerical methods or advanced engineering mathematics and as a precursor to a heat transfer course. The purpose of the module is to pull together many of the mathematical concepts in the early education of mechanical engineering students while at the same time introducing them to other important topics – an application of finite differences to the numerical approximation of partial differential equations, the importance of controlling round-off error in computational algorithms, and the time complexity of some numerical models. Students learn these topics through the execution of computer experiments. The first set of experiments cover the numerical approximation of heat conduction in a ring, and a second set cover the numerical approximation of the reaction and diffusion of chemicals that will produce the markings on an animal’s tail. The learning outcomes of the module are evaluated with data from pre- and post-module surveys given to mechanical engineering students in several sections of a required course in numerical methods.}
