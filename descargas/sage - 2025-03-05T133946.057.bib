abstract = {This article’s aim is to explore the possibilities and limitations of some quantitative tools for the analysis of images. It shows how three different families of tools – manual annotation, eye-tracking and signifier analysis – can help to better understand the meaning effects of figurative and plastic (abstract) elements in pictures. Advantages and disadvantages for each family of tools are discussed. The author also suggests some theoretical implications of the adoption of quantitative tools in the humanities and especially within semiotic disciplines.}

abstract = {The organizational structure is described for a new program that permits computa tions on a variety of quantum mechanical problems in chemical dynamics and spec troscopy. Particular attention was devoted to developing and using algorithms that exploit the capabilities of current vector supercomputers. A key component in this procedure is the recursive transformation of the large sparse Hamiltonian matrix into a much smaller tridiagonal matrix. An ap plication to time-dependent laser-mole cule energy transfer is presented. Rate of energy deposition in the multimode mole cule for systematic variations in the mo lecular intermode coupling parameters is emphasized.}

abstract = {Stroke-related numbness and weakness (SRNW) are resultant symptoms of post-stroke sufferers. Existing research has supported the use of Huangqi Guizhi Wuwu Tang (HGWT) particularly for SRNW; however, their mechanisms of action have not been fully elucidated. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of action of HGWT components targeting SRNW-related proteins through a computational molecular docking approach. Target proteins associated with SRNW were identified through DrugBank database and Open Targets database. Chemical compounds from each herb of HGWT were identified from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology and Analysis Platform (TCMSP). Autodock Vina was utilized and the cut-off criterion applied for protein-ligand complexes was a binding affinity score of ≤ -9.5 kcal/mol; selected protein-ligand complexes were identified using 3D and 2D structural analyses. The protein targets PDE5A and ESR1 have highlighted interactions with compounds (BS040, DZ006, DZ058, DZ118, and HQ066) which are the key molecules in the management of SRNW. PDE5A have bioactivity with the amino acid residues (Val230, Asn252, Gln133 and Thr166) throughout PDE5A-cGMP-PKG pathways which involved reduction in myofilament responsiveness. ESR1 were predicted to be critical active with site residue (Leu346, Glu419 and Leu387) and its proteoglycans pathway involving CD44v3/CD44 that activates rho-associated protein kinase 1 (ROCK1) and ankyrin increasing vascular smooth muscle. In conclusion, HGWT may provide therapeutic benefits through strong interactions between herbal compounds and target proteins of PDE5A and ESR1. Further experimental studies are needed to unequivocally support this result which can be valuable to increase the quality of life of post-stroke patients.

Currently, we evaluate the extent to which this interdisciplinary mission has been upheld over time. To do this, we apply the perspective and tools of big data analytics to the nearly 3 million words that span the 829 articles that comprise the SGR corpus from February 1990 to June 2017. Keyword analysis, ontological ordering, and interdisciplinary content analyses identify intriguing patterns and detect latent trends. Our results speak to the consistent interdisciplinarity of SGR while identifying opportunities for further development and more complex disciplinary integration in research on small groups.}
