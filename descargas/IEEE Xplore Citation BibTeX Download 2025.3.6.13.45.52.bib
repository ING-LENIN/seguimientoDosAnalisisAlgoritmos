  abstract={This paper describes an on-line approach for estimating non-rigid shape and camera pose from monocular video sequences. We assume an initial estimate of the shape at rest to be given and represented by a triangulated mesh, which is encoded by a matrix of the distances between every pair of vertexes. By applying spectral analysis on this matrix, we are then able to compute a low-dimensional shape basis, that in contrast to standard approaches, has a very direct physical interpretation and requires a much smaller number of modes to span a large variety of deformations, either for inextensible or extensible configurations. Based on this low-rank model, we then sequentially retrieve both camera motion and non-rigid shape in each image, optimizing the model parameters with bundle adjustment over a sliding window of image frames. Since the number of these parameters is small, specially when considering physical priors, our approach may potentially achieve real-time performance. Experimental results on real videos for different scenarios demonstrate remarkable robustness to artifacts such as missing and noisy observations.},

  year={2023},

  abstract={This paper investigates the emotional reasoning abilities of the GPT family of large language models. We advocate a component perspective on evaluation that decomposes models into different aspects of emotional reasoning (appraisal derivation, affect/intensity derivation, and consequent derivation). We report two studies. A correlational study examines how the model reasons about autobiographical memories. An experimental study systematically varies aspects of situations in ways previously shown to impact emotion intensity and coping tendencies. Results demonstrate, even without prompt engineering, GPT predictions closely match human-provided appraisals and emotion labels, though GPT struggled to predict emotion intensity and coping responses. GPT-4 performed best on the first study but performed poorly on the second (though it yielded the best results following minor prompt engineering). The evaluation raises questions about how to utilize the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of such models, including dealing with variability in responses. More fundamentally, these studies highlight the benefits of the componential perspective on model evaluation.},

  abstract={Computational thinking is considered critical for learning to code in K-12 education standards. The logic-first, syntax-later argument has been instrumental in promoting block-based languages such as Snap! and Scratch with limited success. In contrast, we believe that expressing the logic of computational problems in the student’s language is more convenient and natural. In such an environment, learners will experience the least impedance mismatch between their conceptual view and the target code they write. In this paper, a new natural language-based programming system, called TryPL (Try Programming in Logic), is introduced and discussed. We demonstrate that TryPL helps to identify gaps in logic and assists in validating learners’ mental models of abstract algorithms. An argument is also made as to why using a natural language-based programming environment and a learning model to teach computational thinking could be more effective and appealing to K-12 and first-year college students.},

  abstract={With the growing need for STEM workers in the job market, schools tend to look for extra-curricular activities that promote this type of skills. With activities like The Inventors or Happy Code, schools encourage kids to have a mindset more open towards technology. Despite these efforts, the tools available to teach programming to primary school students are still lacking. Available solutions can be too difficult to understand, overly expensive for school budgets or may require IT infrastructure that is lacking from the majority of public schools. As a result, this paper aims to create a concept that can convey the fundamentals of programming/Logical Thinking in an accessible and fun way, without using a computer. For this purpose we use a micro-controller, Micro: Bit, and a physical, puzzle-like representation of a programming framework, called MakeCode.},

  abstract={By thinking of a society as a cognitive system, this paper proposes a theoretical framework for artificial social intelligence. This framework is implemented using Knowledge Request-Broker Architecture, and its applicability is experienced in the field of system identification by letting a society of self-interested agents, with various skills, to identify a system based on given training data. To develop a theory about how social intelligence works, two questions were asked. First, “What was changed in time that made less intelligent societies to become more intelligent?”, and second “what drives individuals to take part in social productiveness?”. The framework reported in this paper is inspired by the answers given to these question through the study of the emergence of human civilizations, and putting it beside computer and knowledge engineering concepts. The experiments with this system show how social ensemble of simple autonomous agents can solve harder problems, while demonstrating the practicality of the proposed framework and its associated API.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI), usually referred to as machine intelligence, is a scientific field that gives robots the ability to think like people. AI is a term used to describe a system that simulates human intellect using computer programming. AI is advancing quickly in many multidisciplinary fields, including ophthalmology, from healthcare to the accurate preventive measures, investigation, and treatment plans of illnesses. Because of the emphasis on imaging in the diagnosis of eye illnesses, optometry and ophthalmology is at the forefront of AI in medical field and medicine. Lately, the most prevalent illnesses that cause blindness and visual impairment, such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), have been subjected to deep learning-based AI screening and predictive algorithm models. Deep learning machine with algorithms are the computer models made up of several layers of simulated neurons, are largely responsible for the success of AI in medical field and medicine. These models are capable of learning how data is represented at various levels of abstraction. The trained AI system classified the various forms of DR on optical coherence tomography pictures with accuracy equivalent to that of human specialists. In this study, we focus on the core ideas of AI and how it is applied to the various forms of DR. We also go into further detail on how AI and DL are used in the future of ophthalmology.},

  abstract={Existing cognitive models of narrative creation provide accounts for story invention that, while useful, are too high level to be directly applied to formal systems like computational models of narrative generation. Inversely, existing automatic story generation systems that try to implement cognitive models can only rely on approximations to the general concepts these models describe. In order to provide insight to fill the gap between these two approaches, we have conducted a study in which human participants would invent and write short stories while reflecting on their thoughts out loud. The sessions and the analysis of the recordings was designed so that we could observe which specific modifications the participants apply to their story drafts, with the intention to inform the process of creating computational systems based on cognitive descriptions of the narrative creation process. After running the experiments, annotating the videos and analysing the output, we have concluded that there are a number of common modifications that humans tend to apply to a newly created draft, and that this information can be used to the development of storytelling systems.},

  abstract={This innovative practice full paper proposes a model for centralizing, categorizing and organizing Computational Thinking resources and knowledge. The term “Computational Thinking” usually refers to problem solving skills related to Computer Science. Yet, there is neither: a consensual definition of what exactly is this term about; nor which skills are involved. Even under these conditions, several studies are conducted regarding this theme around the world, as well as informal activities applied by non-researchers enthusiasts. Thus, a model to reunite both, academic and non-scientific community, around the Computational Thinking is proposed: the Partnership for Advancing Computational Thinking, PACT. On one hand it is an effort to guide convergence in the literature, leading to more standardized definitions and spotting similarities or disagreements between authors. And on the other hand, it is a platform for sharing resources and experiences between the communities, an initiative to bring the model of research with public participation (Citizen Science) to education. An expandable ontology that is able to consider the perspective of multiple authors over the subjects is used to implement the model. Three different author views and resources are instantiated to illustrate the range, expressiveness and operation of the ontology. It is revealed able to model author views from previous models, frameworks and even discursive texts, as well as linking resources of different natures by their purpose and subjects approached.},

  abstract={In 2008, Lotfi Zadeh concluded that to make significant progress toward achievement of human level machine intelligence a paradigm shift is needed. In previous papers we introduced the computational information conservation theory (CICT) approach to get more effective and reliable cognitive, biophysical, and biomedical engineering simulation solutions. CICT new computational information conservation awareness can open the way for a paradigm shift to recover lost coherence information in system description and to develop even advanced quantum cognitive systems. To achieve this result, in present paper, we show the fundamental pre-spatial geometro-arithmetic scheme defining optimized numeric word generators and relations to minimize the traditional multiscale statistic modeling veil opacity and information entropy generation. It is the first, fundamental step to an effective progression from computing with numbers to computing with numeric words with precisation of their meaning. This paper is a relevant contribution towards an effective and convenient “Science 2.0” universal computational framework to achieve deeper cognitive intelligence at your fingertips and beyond.},

  year={2022},

  number={},
  pages={132965-132975},
  abstract={Computational thinking is a key universal competence, often taught using methods specific to computer science. One step towards achieving it is learning to analyse and create algorithms. Researchers have long been trying to establish how the form of representation of algorithms (pseudocode versus flowchart) affects its understanding and have reached varying, sometimes conflicting results. This article presents findings that provide objective new data on this topic. In our experiment, we used two different types of algorithmic tasks with three levels of complexity and a group of 114 research participants with varying programming skills. In addition, we used an eye tracking technique that allowed us to collect detailed information about the subjects’ attention distribution during analysis of algorithms. Our results show that subjects took significantly less time to analyse flowcharts (than they did with pseudocode), made much fewer errors, and had higher confidence in the correctness of their solution. Based on eye tracking data, a reduced number of both re-analyses of the algorithm and input data re-referencing was observed for graphically presented tasks. The difference in favour of flowcharts was revealed (with few exceptions) for all levels of algorithm complexity (simple, medium, complex), while regarding the duration of analysis the advantage of flowcharts increased with the growing complexity of algorithms. For complex algorithms, a significant relationship was observed between algorithm presentation and level of programming skills versus the duration of task solving and confidence level. Our study strongly supports the idea of using graphic representation of algorithms both when learning to code and in acquiring computational thinking skills.},

  abstract={As an important course in computer education in higher education, the programming basic course has problems in teaching and learning. The role of teachers is knowledge imparters. And the teaching methods despise students' development. Students often have fears and difficulties in their study, which is not conducive to build their computer application ability and computational thinking. In view of the teaching status quo and existing problems of the programming basic course, this paper proposes to use SPOC blended teaching mode to clarify the role of teachers and students, to develop an interactive teaching mode, to adopt case teaching, to enrich SPOC resources. And we provide students with timely feedback, and change the evaluation methods and other aspects. Through these reforms, we found that students' ability to read and write programs have been improved. The quality of teaching, and the cultivation of computational thinking are improved.},

  abstract={This study focused on a bachelor- university-level course that aims to design and implement a robotic-coding camp to train pre-service teachers. Seventeen pre-service teachers participated in this study conducted in the Computational Empowerment Lab at the Center of Teacher Education at the University of Vienna. The researchers aimed to identify specific improvement strategies for in-service and pre-service teachers to enhance their pedagogical practices in designing a robotic-coding camp by promoting student critical thinking, computational thinking, and problem-solving competencies. Additionally, the study proposed to identify the relevant features of the camp's design and implementation that can promote practitioners' engagement and address the challenges they face. The course was offered during the summer semester of 2023. For the procedure of the study, pre-service teachers thought about a problem or situation using the phenomena-based learning method and explained the problem using mediating tools, including educational robots, 3D printers, laser-cutting, and creative Lego boxes, among others. At the end of the course, students developed their project, designed a prototype of a robotic-coding camp, and created digital stories as real-world basis problem statements for their project. Students' assignments and group work interactions, including forum discussions in Moodle, reflection papers, and hands-on activities, were used as data sources. Data collected and analyzed by qualitatively. Participatory action research was used as a research method. The results provide guidelines for how to design and implement robotic coding camps and digital stories for teachers who might want to implement a robotic camp in their future careers. In addition, the results suggest improvement strategies for designing robotic coding activities, including four action steps: (1) phenomenon-based problem statement, (2) visualizing the problem as a digital story, (3) finding a pattern in the problem and (4) creating the learning environment and coding. The most challenging part was the third step, in which participant had difficulty finding a pattern within the problem.},

The main goal of this study is to examine which programming concepts students use when they want to develop a game, and what is the interrelation among these concepts. To achieve our goal, a field study was designed and data were collected from coding activities. In detail, during a two-week period, one-day workshops were organized almost every day on which 44 children participating in, with ages between 8-17. The workshops follow a constructionist approach and comprise of two parts. First the children interact with robots, and then develop a game using Scratch. The findings provide a deeper understanding on how children code by showing the use of specific programming concepts to develop their projects and their correlations. Hence, we improve our knowledge about children's competences in coding.},

All consumer devices use some type of volatile and nonvolatile memory along with processing and communication. Memory and processing have been separate operations using distinct devices; however, there are products becoming available that combine processing power in storage devices, and there is work underway to create processing in close association with digital storage (often called computational storage) or even using technologies where processing is in very close association with nonvolatile memories (in-memory computing). Some emerging memory technologies even have characteristics that can mimic the operations of neurons in the brain and are being used for neuromorphic computing.

Computer science and engineering salaries are high, but yet it is unlikely that the number of technology majors will meet the projected demand. Sadly, for many students their first college computer science or engineering course is their last. This is particularly true for women and other under-represented groups. Over the last 20 years, we have tried to increase enrollment and retention by embedding embedded systems throughout our computer science curriculum. This year, we have extended that effort to a general education course that satisfies our campus' art and diversity requirements. Creative Fabrication demonstrates the creativity inherent in computer science and engineering through the implementation of three art projects: 1) an LED enabled sculpture representing disability, 2) a moving sculpture representing disability, and 3) a sculptural assistive technology solution designed for a specific disability. All projects connect technology to differently abled human beings via computational crafting - fabricating aesthetically pleasing and functional works.},

Modding communities are active, digital distribution systems are essential, and hardware can be customized. Future developments in gaming, such as virtual reality, cloud gaming, and artificial intelligence, portend more innovation in the industry. The game, Plants vs Zombies is represented by Finite Automata and it is ruled by DFAs and NFAs which describe the actions and behaviours of both the plants and the zombies and the result of their actions. In the proposed work you can notice how the NFA will be converted to DFA and vice versa due to its handy functions. Overall, "Plants vs Zombies" is a fun and interactive way for players to explore computational thinking while learning about the complex ideas of NFA and DFA in Automata Theory. The advantages are Synchronize State Management, Consistent State Transitions, Easier Development, and Unambiguous Animation Staging.},

Of particular importance is the process of acquiring the habits of systematic and disciplined inquiry characteristic of organized science. To the social theorist and policy maker, however, the existence of a new, more powerful view of learning is a mixed blessing. Decisions of how best to implement the lessons of the cognitive revolution require technocratic know-how as well as social and political judgment. I discuss the cognitive revolution by offering a comparison of two contrasting views of education that it has produced, which I call "institution-centred" and "person-centred" methodologies. In terms of their pedagogical effectiveness, both methodologies have been shown to be successful, when implemented in a congenial social environment by competent professionals. The essential difference is political. An institution-centered methodology has as side-effect to encourage a greater sense of commitment, loyalty and perhaps even dependence in regard to teachers, educational and social institutions and authority figures in general; in contrast, a person-centered methodology encourages a greater sense of autonomy and self-reliance. Cognitive methods can be useful for policy makers with a wide range of priorities and commitments, if correctly chosen.},

  year={2020},
  volume={},

  pages={3107-3114},
  abstract={Problem solving tests associated with convergent thinking are often used to analyze the creative ability of an individual. Such tests consist of problems whose solution can be reached by an analytical or a creative insight based approach. Detection of creative individuals amongst others undertaking such tests is thus quite challenging since a correct response to the presented problem can be reached using two different cognitive styles. The paper attempts to address a solution to this issue using EEG analysis system. The proposed technique intends to classify the two cognitive styles involved in solving convergent problems with the main motivation of selecting creative individuals amongst other examinees. Moreover, the proposed strategy also attempts to highlight the creative ability of every selected creative individual under three levels: low, medium or high. In other words, the present scheme aims to distinguish creative subjects along with their levels of creative ability from the analytical ones.The procurement of EEG signals from the subjects engaged in the problem solving test are fed to a novel attention induced capsule network to categorize the desired class labels after undergoing the pre-processing and feature extraction phases. Performance analysis undertaken confirms the superlative behavior of the proposed classifier over the state-of-the-art techniques. Thus, the proposed scheme can find its applications in the recruitment of creative individuals in various strata of organizations linked with creation and innovation such as advertising, business, engineering and the like.},

The courses were developed to address industry's need for improved problem-solving skills, incorporating consistent, deep collaboration with Google technical staff The first of its kind for CAHSI, the problem-solving courses are fewer credit hours than typical courses in order to fit within a traditional curriculum. The intent is to instill complementary problem-solving, computational thinking skills, and logical reasoning needed to succeed in computer science, and make this content available across different student populations at various stages in their academic pathways. Advanced problem solving prepares students for competitive interviews. The courses create opportunities to learn across academic levels, and create new student communities, mentorship opportunities, and social connections to support retention. The paper reports on the course design, student reflection, assessment and evaluation, and an ethnographic study of the courses.},

A concept for an immersive educational virtual environment for learning the theoretical computer science concept of finite state machines is presented. A first draft for the virtual reality aims to immerse students in a world of islands (states) with treasure islands (final states). Each symbol from the input alphabet is illustrated through another boat on every island. Students navigate through the islands by looking at one of the boats on the current island using a head-mounted-display. They then take the shipping route of the selected boat (the state-transition function) by pressing a button on a controller. The goal of the game can either be to reach Treasure Island and open the treasure chest or to complete the map.},

One class of 24 students was randomly assigned to the experimental group using JCLM-MVS to conduct Scratch programming learning, whereas the other class of 24 students was assigned to the control group using the traditional teacher-centered teaching method. The study found that the experimental group of learners showed significantly better learning performance than the control group.

  pages={489-494},
  abstract={Knowledge based methodology is one of the primary areas of development in engineering problem solving methods for decades. In the meantime, product definition has been moved into model space. Establishment of the STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data, ISO 10303) product model standard and it application at leading industries during 90's facilitated development of model based integrated solutions for product engineering. During the past decade, the new paradigm of product lifecycle management stimulated integrated handling of information for lifecycle of products. Product model has become a medium in communication between end users of engineering systems including humans and controlled equipment. One of the most critical elements in this scenario is communication of knowledge with product modeling processes in order to generate knowledge background of engineering object definition in product model. This paper introduces a method by the authors to extract knowledge background during definition of product objects in the form of initiated affect on product. Human thinking process is modeled by its elements during definition of intent for a change of a product. Evolving steps towards the defined object changes and the served objectives for the defined objects are recorded. Following this, process for the definition of coordinated product behaviors and affect propagation in a specific and purposeful change affect zone are explained. Finally, an extended product definition space is explained as medium in integrated product modeling using the proposed method.},

In mapping a Cooley-Tukey type FFT to such a network, the main concerns are effective use of the high connectivity/bandwidth of the Boolean n-cube, the computational resources, the storage bandwidth, if there is a storage hierarchy, and the pipelines should the arithmetic units have such a feature. Another important consideration in a multiprocessor, distributed storage architecture is the allocation and access to coefficients, if they are precomputed. FFT algorithms are described that use both the storage bandwidth and the communication system optimally and require storage of P+nN coefficients for a transform on P>or=N data elements. A complex-to-complex FFT on 16 million points is predicted to require about 1.5 s on a Connection Machine model CM-2.<>},

  abstract={This Innovative Practice Full Paper presents an approach to improve teaching materials and assessment tools for K-12 programming education together by creating a virtuous cycle. Improving teaching materials for computing education is in line with the conference theme “Creating a convergence in engineering education and workforce development”. In this research, coding sheets are used as a part of the teaching materials, and the assessment tools are used to assess the algorithmic thinking ability of the students. The assumption here is that there is a mutual impact between the improvement of teaching materials and that of assessment tools. This kind of strategy is important, especially in the setting of elementary school education in Japan in which conducting a pilot study is difficult. In Japan, the new curriculum guidelines were fully implemented in April 2020 in elementary schools and in April 2021 in junior high schools respectively. They will be implemented in April 2022 in high schools. Since the announcement of the new curriculum guidelines, the boards of education in the local governments have been preparing for the programming education in the schools. However, there are still remaining problems, including the shortage of trained teachers and the lack of good assessment tools. In order to remedy the shortage of trained teachers, we designed some coding sheets for the teaching materials consisting of block parts, servo motors, DC-motors, LEDs, and sensors. In our assessment tools which are supposed to assess students' Computational Thinking ability, we included only the questions for assessing algorithmic thinking ability, as there is a limited amount of time for the assessment in schools. We have used our teaching materials and our assessment tools in some elementary schools. Based on the results of the teaching activities, we discuss the strategy to improve the teaching materials and the assessment tools together.},

  year={2007},
  volume={54},
  number={6},
  pages={1161-1166},
  abstract={Current thinking attributes information processing for neuromuscular control exclusively to the nervous system. Our cadaveric experiments and computer simulations show, however, that the tendon network of the fingers performs logic computation to preferentially change torque production capabilities. How this tendon network propagates tension to enable manipulation has been debated since the time of Vesalius and DaVinci and remains an unanswered question. We systematically changed the proportion of tension to the tendons of the extensor digitorum versus the two dorsal interosseous muscles of two cadaver fingers and measured the tension delivered to the proximal and distal interphalangeal joints. We find that the distribution of input tensions in the tendon network itself regulates how tensions propagate to the finger joints, acting like the switching function of a logic gate that nonlinearly enables different torque production capabilities. Computer modeling reveals that the deformable structure of the tendon networks is responsible for this phenomenon; and that this switching behavior is an effective evolutionary solution permitting a rich repertoire of finger joint actuation not possible with simpler tendon paths. We conclude that the structural complexity of this tendon network, traditionally oversimplified or ignored, may in fact be critical to understanding brain-body coevolution and neuromuscular control. Moreover, this form of information processing at the macroscopic scale is a new instance of the emerging principle of nonneural "somatic logic" found to perform logic computation such as in cellular networks},

  pages={365-370},
  abstract={With the introduction of distance learning during the lockdown, teachers faced a number of problems on how to implement the teaching. Educational robotics was particularly negatively affected by this period. In our country, educational robotics is usually taught in informatics classes. However, in many schools, the teaching of informatics during the lockdown was very limited and often focused only on basic digital skills. As a similar situation occurred in several European countries, the idea of supporting teachers in such cases was proposed. Within an international project we are involved in, a methodology is being designed to develop computational thinking in students at all school levels through educational robotics in combination with a school arts subject. The methodology is based on the idea of project-based learning and should use blended learning methods. In this paper, we describe the planning and the course of an educational activity – a project – using the currently developed methodology. The results presented are from its pilot validation with lower-secondary students without previous experience with robotics. The project combined the theme of Greek myths with robotics using LEGO SPIKE Prime. During the validation, we focused primarily on students’ work with basic programming concepts. Our research problem was to validate the quality and potential of the proposed methodology and the computational thinking skills it can develop. The paper concludes with recommendations for further development of the methodology and also for the use of the selected robotic kit with respect to programming in informatics classes.},

  abstract={The introduction of Computational Thinking skills at school has mostly been associated with programming skills. In this paper we present an approach that is based on modeling, a skill that is commonly taught in Computer Science degrees, often in the last years as it is considered a higher-level, complex skill. Modeling includes various thinking processes like abstraction, reduction, structuring, generalization, among others, that are part of computational thinking in particular and problem solving in general, too. Our hypothesis is that using different modeling techniques from computer science (e.g., UML diagrams) in several subjects at school can be a good way to introduce computational thinking. Therefore we have performed a semi-controlled experiment with Ni=558 students (age 8-16) and N2=18 educators that have used modeling in their lessons. Our results show a promising effect of the use of modeling in the lessons. Educators have a positive vision of modeling.},

  abstract={For many people, writing is a difficult task because finding a good topic and suitable elements is just not an easy job. In this study, we put our focus on narrative creation and propose that a Picture-Attributed-Note (PAN) framework can help with writing job. Picture and attributed notes were used to present and record story elements and to stimulate creativity. The attributed notes are presented in texts and characterized through the following six attributes: Character, Location, Object, Situation, Action, and Theme (CLOSAT) were used in this study to categorize the texts. We hope that stimulated through the pictures and attributed notes, users can better utilize creativity for their stories. In this study, we have implemented the PAN framework as a computer-aided system and conducted experiments to find out how one user would utilize the PAN system for story writing. Four participants were invited to create a story, including one without using the PAN system. We used content analysis to analyze the data through four main categories of coding: Conceptual, Operational, Perceptional and Evaluation (COPE), proposed by Chen [1]. The results reveal that the PAN system helps stimulate user's creativity and did not change their main creating process. In addition, the user interface of the PAN system could allow the user to concentrate more on the writing creation process.},

  abstract={The fast pace of change in high technology product development requires high flexibility and adaptation in product design and technology management. Within this context, appropriate learning environments are planned to shape future Information and Communication Technology staff in such a way they could get able to keep up with new trends and innovations. A constructivist educational model based on Active Learning represents a step towards this vision for staff training. This paper deals with a new organization of a 13 weeks course based on the inverted class model, where students are introduced to the problem-posing domain by a direct involvement of enterprises, which participate specifically to the problem definition and assessment phases. In the case study shown, students simulate a production business unit in all the phases that characterize the product/service development life cycle. A mixed traditional and company-based organization of the course is supposed to improve students competences by proposing solutions leveraging on appropriate tools taken from traditional experiences and also gaining benefits from a learning-by-doing approach that encourages the use of state-of-the-art solutions. A preliminary study is performed to see how expected professional competences are met during the course, with the additional goal of collecting indications that could help to improve the learning framework for future editions of the course.},

  abstract={The widespread usage of wearables set the foundations for many new applications that process the wearable sensor data. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a well-studied application that targets to classify the data captured by multiple wearable sensors into one of a predefined set of activity classes. Earlier approaches in the area relied on Machine Learning (ML) classifiers, while many researchers proposed solutions based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), e.g., using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) or Convolution Neural Network (CNNs). Even though the usage of DNNs for HAR is a widely explored field, the problem of compressing (thus reducing the computational requirements) the resulting DNN models has been disregarded by the research community. This is of paramount importance if we consider that wearables are characterized by scarce memory and computational resources. In this work, we first analyze the impact of the size of the various CNN components (focusing on the convolution and dense layers) to the model validation performance. As a second step, we focus on two CNN models with diverse memory characteristics (the lean and the fat model) and we employ three different compression techniques (Filter-Based Pruning –FBP,– Low Rank Factorization –LRF,– and dynamic range quantization) assuming various compressibility scenarios.},

  abstract={The ongoing liberalisation of the power sector adds a new dimension to the main issues in modelling of power systems. The very complex interactions and interdependencies among power market participants are much like those studied in game theory. However, the strategies used by market participants are often too complex to be conveniently modelled by standard game theoretic techniques. In addition, there has been much less research in the field of dynamic strategic behaviour and their impact on the electricity price in European markets. In this paper, we show new, prosperous combination of computational science and new ideas in evolutionary economics and cognitive science offering appealing extensions to traditional game theoretical modelling. We demonstrate the feasibility of implementing our approach in Matlab using learning algorithm and illustrate its advantages in more detailed and realistic representation of the strategic behaviour of biggest power producers in European power market.},

People are also becoming more interested in direct current (DC) MGs because DC delivery schemes have benefits like less damage and quick alignment of energy loading resources. With the rise of distributed output, a DCMG with many fonts is an important area to investigate. In this DCMG with many sources, the goal is to offer voltage help and strong value division. The control technique includes a thorough analysis of the "state-of-the-art" control procedures in DCMGs. This is important because it makes sure that MG's power and performance are always the same. In this section, the main and secondary control mechanisms in the DCMG hierarchy are explained. In particular, the main ways to control internal loop and droop control are looked at. The secondary regulation is a solution that is centralized, spread out, and independent.},

  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={150-156},
  abstract={To better understand the nature, function and elicitation conditions of emotion it is important to approach studying emotion from a multidisciplinary perspective involving psychology, neuroscience and affective computing. Recently, the TDRL Theory of Emotion has been proposed. It defines emotions as variations of temporal difference assessments in reinforcement learning. In this paper we present new evidence for this theory. We show that regret - a negative emotion that signifies that an alternative action should have been taken given new outcome evidence - is modelled by a particular form of TD error assessment. In our model regret is attributed to each action in the state-action trace of an agent for which - after new reward evidence - an alternative action becomes the best action in that state (the new argmax) after adjusting the action value of the chosen action in that state. Regret intensity is modeled as the difference between this new best action and the adjusted old best action, reflecting the additional amount of return that could have been received should that alternative have been chose. We show in simulation experiments how regret varies depending on the amount of adjustment as well as the adjustment mechanism, i.e. Q-trace, Sarsa-trace, and Monte Carlo (MC) re-evaluation of action values. Our work shows plausible regret attribution to actions, when this model of regret is coupled with MC action value update. This is important evidence that regret can be seen as a particular variation of TD error assessment involving counterfactual thinking.},

These problems are manifested as combinatorial complexity of algorithms, of their computational or training requirements. The paper relates particular types of complexity problems to the roles of a priori knowledge and adaptive learning. Paradigms based on adaptive learning lead to the complexity of training procedures, while nonadaptive rule-based paradigms lead to complexity of rule systems. Model-based approaches to combining adaptivity with a priori knowledge lead to computational complexity. Arguments are presented for the Aristotelian logic being culpable for the difficulty of combining adaptivity and a priority. The potential role of the fuzzy logic in overcoming current difficulties is discussed. Current mathematical difficulties are related to philosophical debates of the past.},

  abstract={When large data repositories are coupled with geographic distribution of data, users and systems, it is necessary to combine different technologies for implementing high-performance distributed knowledge discovery systems. On the other hand, computational grid is emerging as a very promising infrastructure for high-performance distributed computing. Grid applications such as astronomy, chemistry, engineering, climate studies, geology, oceanography, ecology, physics, biology, health sciences and computer science often involve large amounts of computing and/or data. For these reasons, we think grids can offer an effective support to the implementation and use of parallel and distributed data mining systems. This paper describes development of parallel and distributed prior algorithm on grid environment. Apriori algorithm along with FP-growth (frequent pattern growth) is implemented on grid network in each grid node, which finds the local support counts and prunes all infrequent item sets. After completing local pruning, each grid node broadcasts messages containing all the remaining frequent patterns to the coordinator. We have compared the output of conventional method of apriori algorithm with FP-tree in both homogenous and heterogeneous environments. Practical datasets are large in nature and taken from the UCI machine repository and are related to adult, mushroom, and letter recognition, are used to measure the system performance. The detailed experiment procedure and result analysis are also discussed in this paper. In future the security issue among different local datasets and the huge communication cost in data migration can be considered.},

  abstract={STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math-ematics) education is crucial, rising the demand for technological skills driven by the Industry 4.0 digital transformation, and fostering problem-solving, autonomy, computational thinking, creativity, innovation, and effective teamwork skills. To properly address the lack of structured materials in secondary schools, an Educational Design Research (EDR) project was developed to introduce young students to STEM, and particularly to electronics field. For this purpose, the developed approach combines instructionism and constructionism methods, through three educational projects and “Drops of knowledge” modules. The developed material was applied to 9th and 12th grades of a secondary school, with the achieved results showing that this immersive approach effectively provides students with the necessary competencies to tackle the initial technological challenges of electronics. The project was recognized by the Directorate General of Education of Portugal as a recommended practice of a digital initiative within secondary schools.},

  abstract={This Research Work in Progress Paper aims to develop holistic competencies in engineering students through course-level teaching and learning activities. Information is the core of many engineering fields, such as communications engineering, signal processing, and computational intelligence. Despite its ambient existence in our everyday lives, most of the engineering students are not aware of the connection between information and their professional role as an engineer in the informational world. We seek to engage engineering students in understanding their professional and ethical responsibility, and promote their awareness of the impact of engineering solutions in a global and societal context. Our study is grounded in the intersection between two theoretical frameworks: (1) Holistic Competencies and (2) William Perry’s scheme of intellectual and ethical development. Having students’ learning evidence against William Perry’s framework and identified students’ cognitive changes along their course study, we suggest that holistic competencies can be fostered through cultivating students’ multifaceted understanding of information and supplementing with real cases where social media serve as a channel for students to exchange ideas to address various global challenges.},

  abstract={Technological trends have evolved, extended and converged in the 21st century. Much of these evolutions are incremental, differential and the aim is to sustain or rise above others amidst a dynamic landscape. As data and knowledge bases extend, the fitness of features in each evolution requires systemic modelling targeting multi-objectives. Identification of the local regions of interest and significant features enable more efficient optimization. The information core, current or new invariant features which proceed to the next iteration coupled with gamification in certain domains, can lead to varying implications. This paper briefly reviews literature on associative networks, case-based reasoning, combinations and permutations, optimization, and gamification and conclude with implications and opportunities for symbiotic networks.},

  abstract={Partial Least-Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) is a popular machine learning tool that is gaining increasing attention as a useful feature selector and classifier. In an effort to understand its strengths and weaknesses, we performed a series of experiments with synthetic data and compared its performance to its close relative from which it was initially invented, namely Principal Component Analysis (PCA). We demonstrate that even though PCA ignores the information regarding the class labels of the samples, this unsupervised tool can be remarkably effective as a feature selector. In some cases, it outperforms PLS-DA, which is made aware of the class labels in its input.Our experiments range from looking at the signal-to-noise ratio in the feature selection task, to considering many practical distributions and models encountered when analyzing bioinformatics and clinical data. Other methods were also evaluated.Our work sheds light on the kind of relationships and data models with which PLS-DA can be effective both as a feature selector as well as a classifier. In particular, we claim that when classes are determined by linear or non-linear relationships, PLS-DA provides almost no insight into the data. But it is effective when the classes have a clustered distribution on the signal features, even when these features are hidden among a large number of noise. PLS-DA retains a strong performance even when the classes are contained in n-orthotopes (i.e., rectangular boxes in the subspace of the signal features).Finally, we analyzed an interesting data set from 396 vaginal microbiome samples where the ground truth for the feature selection was available. Again, the results highlighted the strengths and weaknesses of PLS-DA in comparison with PCA.},

  pages={0358-0360},
  abstract={Cognitive training is considered as an effective intervention for slowing cognitive decline, however single-domain training programs have shown limited transfer to untrained tasks. Complex cognitive training has a potential to yield broader transfer effect. Given that creative thinking involves variety of cognitive subprocesses, creative tasks may be useful as a complex training paradigm. In line with this assumption, creative engagement has a neuroprotective effect in older subjects, improving mental health and well-being. However, neural mechanisms underlying the effect has remained unknown. Evidence suggests that post-task changes in resting-state brain activity may be detected in regions involved during training. The current study was aimed to reveal changes in electroencephalographic (EEG) activity during creative task performance and to identify whether those activity patterns persist in the baseline EEG after the end of a creative session. EEG was registered in 25 elderly ( 64±6 years) high-functioning subjects before, during and after creative problem solving, consisting of 30 verbal and 30 figural tasks. Current source density estimates and subsequent statistical contracts using statistical non-parametrical mapping (SnPM) were calculated via LORETA package. We found a significant increase of spectral density from pre- to post-task interval in theta-gamma frequency bands. The effect was localized in parieto-occipital cortex, overlapping with the region showing synchronization during the tasks performance. Observed changes in resting-state EEG activity may be considered as an indicator of use-dependent neuroplasticity.},

  abstract={This concept paper suggests a new way of thinking about the origin, growth, and spread of a general-purpose "scientific habit of mind" in humans, and discusses how intelligent coaching agents may help. The argument begins with a description of the role of the cognitive cycle in animal thinking. We then examine critical differences between non-human and human cognition, especially in respect to the crucial and yet problematic role of language and linguistic interaction in the "widening spread and deepening hold" of scientific thinking and discourse in human populations. The paper concludes with a vision of a new kind of open, networked learning community inhabited by human learners, human experts, and intelligent agents, and suggests ways of evaluating the development of scientific thinking within these communities using a combination of social network and semantic space analysis.},

  abstract={This system proposes a question-answer model to analyze answers given by the users to the open-ended question. For this system, we use a squad dataset. The squad dataset is helpful for open-ended questions. The model uses NLP and the BERT question-answer model for handling the answers. Problem-solving deals with the analysis of questions and answering them in a creative, feasible, and efficient way. The problem-solving the approach gives the way of thinking of the problem solver. Computational methods along with NLP are being developed to calculate these indices. With the help of question-answer systems in NLP, the users’ answers are analyzed and measured are being attempts to perform such analysis but the answers to the questions are varied from person to person which makes answer analysis challenging. Answers given by users and answer for the question present in the squad dataset is compared by using cosine similarity to calculate the creativity index. The creativity index is a linear combination of fluency, flexibility, uniqueness, and elaboration indices; calculated for every given answer by comparing given answers and the stored answers. The system is trained and tested for the general questions present in the squad dataset. This system is beneficial to predict and measure the creative thinking, problem-solving ability, and thinking ability of the user. It helps to build the work culture, societal culture, and behavior of individuals in the institution, community, and workplace. The CI is a tremendously useful tool for businesses, office employees, and students. Thinking and problem-solving skills are calculated using this technique.},

  abstract={The authors report on a model-based object recognition system and its parallel implementation on the Connection Machine system. The goal is to recognize two-dimensional objects in a scene, given a reasonably large database of known objects. The system uses massively parallel hypotheses generation and parameter space clustering in place of serial constraint propagation. Local boundary features that constrain an object's position and orientation provide a basis for hypothesis generation. Parameter space clustering of hypotheses is used to rank hypotheses according to preliminary evidence prior to verification. This greatly reduces the time for recognition and number of hypotheses that must be tested. Experiments show that the time required by this approach scales at a much slower range than either the number of objects in the database or objects in the scene.<>},

  abstract={The deleterious effects of not bringing projects quickly from the laboratory to the market are described, and corporate efforts to cut development time are examined. Many Japanese companies have already wrestled with this problem and moved on to other issues, like their need for basic research. As a result, many US corporations are looking to the Japanese for guidance. This is leading companies to restructure their organizations to encourage open, frequent, and early communication. Launching research projects with technology transfer in view from the start is another approach modeled after the Japanese. Central to Japanese technology transfer is the fact that as a project moves from laboratory to market, the engineers move with it. This is also being tried by some US firms. A less widespread approach to shortening time to market is called concurrent engineering, in which an item is designed concurrently with the processes that would be used to assemble it, manufacture its parts, test it, and repair it in the field. Standardization is also being used to boost researchers' output.<>},

In light of this, this paper focuses on the collection and preprocessing of textual data in the power sector and proposes a method for constructing multi-scale fine-tuning samples in the power sector based on the chain of thought. By introducing multi-scale analysis methods, power system data is divided according to different temporal and spatial scales, thereby creating a sample set with hierarchical structure and diversity. This method can adaptively adjust the selection and enhancement strategies of samples based on the characteristics of data at different scales, thus effectively representing and modeling the complex data of the power system and improving the efficiency and accuracy of text data processing in the power sector.},

While such disparities are seen at particular schools, such disparities do not exist in disciplinary courses such as history, math, or science where all students are required to take these courses. This paper discusses an approach to broaden minority participation in computing through the integration of Computer Science (CS) into a history course. This poster proposes an alignment between computational thinking and historical thinking that makes history courses an attractive fit for CS integration. It also presents results from the pilot study of a project-based cross-disciplinary curriculum using MIT App inventor that leverages students' interests in mobile technology to facilitate the creation of historical mobile apps. This curricular approach is built on a theoretical framework rooted in Constructivist and Constructionist learning where students construct and produce knowledge, artifacts, and technology rather than consume them. Our initial results suggest that students were engaged in the material and were enthusiastic about the creation of their mobile app.},

  abstract={Over the past decade, the teaching of coding and computational thinking has become increasingly important in the school environment. If before they were a secondary part of the teaching program and provided only, at best, from the age of eleven and up, it is now clear that they should play a relevant role in the school curriculum as soon as possible. In recent years, many solutions, both papery and software applications, have been developed for encoding. However, the remaining problem is that every available solution has been designed for a very precise and limited scope, both of age and skills, without thinking of a more generalizable use for a long period. This work therefore aims to choose some of the tools available, designed for different needs but sufficiently similar in order to allow the development of a fluid and continuous coding educational path, gradually adding new complexities, starting from the age of three in the school of childhood, up to high school.},

  abstract={Design rationale (DR) explains the product design decision-making process and the reason behind the decision. Capturing and reusing of the DR plays an important role in design thinking guidance and decision support. In order to clearly reflect the essential characteristics of design activities such as design iteration and design evolution in design process, a reconstruction method of the DR model is proposed based on design context. The limitations of the existing DR models in the expression of evolution information and knowledge reuse support are illustrated. And the concept of design context is put forward and two new DR element interaction relationships are defined to reconstruct FGDR model to eliminate redundant information. So the method contributes to optimize the DR model in its knowledge expression form and knowledge expression ability. This can further strengthen the DR model's support to design reuse. A prototype system is developed for DR modeling and reconstruction. Partial design process of the POGO mechanical system design is taken as an example to validate the feasibility and validity of the proposed method.},

  abstract={Integral of single variable functions is an important issue in calculus. This problem is widely applied in many fields such as physics, economics, etc. Systems for automatic solving integral problems are necessary tools in education. They support students and teachers in learning and teaching. Current computer algebra systems such as Maple, Mathematica, etc can solve integral problems. However, they output the result only or are limited to give the complete solution. This paper presents a model for representing knowledge about single variable functions and proposes some algorithms for solving integral problem automatically. These algorithms mimic the human way of thinking and produce the solution that explains the calculus process.},

  abstract={In this study, digital game design is analyzed as a team-based knowledge modelling process. In the context of a graduate seminar, the students were organized in teams and were asked to design a serious game. In the early stages of the process, each team had the possibility to engage in a topic suggested by the professor or decide their topic of interest. Half of the teams choose a suggested topic (herd immunity, intergenerational communication, active ageing); the other half proposed a topic of their choice (inuits and micmacs, banker-customer relationship, French as a Foreign Language). In both cases, the students should engage in a participative design process which requires a learner-centered analysis. We analyze both the digital game design process and outcomes of the game design from the perspective of social participation and the 4C competencies deployed in the game design process: communication, collaboration, creativity and critical thinking.},

  abstract={Mobile data acquisition technology in the hands of computer-proficient college students provides opportunities to transform electronics laboratory education into a more ubiquitous model. The use of virtual instruments (VIs), handheld data acquisition (DAQ) modules, and supporting portable hardware can (a) encourage students to work outside of the classroom on procedural hands-on learning activities and (b) promote students' higher-level thinking via instructor and student interactions during follow-on meeting times. This project, funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Course, Curriculum, and Laboratory Improvement (CCLI) program, explores ways to implement this more ubiquitous education model. The project team will (1) develop inexpensive mobile laboratory tools, (2) create new laboratory protocols, (3) assess the impact of these learning experiences, and (4) disseminate these tools and assessment results. This paper focuses on tasks (2) and (3) for four courses in the East Carolina University (ECU) General Engineering program and the Kansas State University (KSU) Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) programs.},

  abstract={This paper presents a case study that explores the successful integration of project-based learning (PBL) in two courses, Biometry and Computer Vision, at the University of -DFBR-. The study emphasizes the positive impact of PBL not only on academic performance but also on student well-being, motivation, and self-regulated learning skills. In both courses, PBL was employed as a powerful tool to actively engage students in their learning process and enhance their understanding of complex subjects. The project developed by the students served as a vehicle to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world scenario, ensuring the comprehensive coverage of the course topics. The outcome of this study revealed a positive impact of PBL methodology on student performance, which was indicated by their final grades and active participation during synchronous moments throughout the course duration. Moreover, the implementation of PBL has fostered a positive and motivating learning environment, as students embrace the opportunity to work on authentic, hands-on projects. The enhancement of self-regulated learning skills, including goal setting, time management, and re-flection, further contributes to students' overall academic growth. Furthermore, the transversal skills acquired by students in the PBL environment are relevant. Collaborative problem-solving, effective communication, critical thinking, and adaptability are just a few of the key skills that students develop through their active engagement in projects. This paper offers an exploration of the successful integration of PBL in engineering education. The study provides valuable insights into the transformative potential of PBL, not only in the referred courses but as a model for innovative engineering education practices. The experience at the University of -DFBR- illustrates how PBL can nurture a new generation of competent, motivated, and adaptable engineers, ready to tackle the challenges of an ever-changing world.},

  abstract={We present an exploratory study that aims to diagnose the Engineering in Computational Technologies students' level of awareness with respect to the impact of the accelerated use of technology and the exponential growth that private socio-digital platforms have in everyday life because of the COVID-19 confinement. We research possible deterministic postures in the students' positions that could impede their ethical analysis of the social and environmental effects of the advance of data capitalism, among which racialization, algorithmic sexualization, and discrimination, as well as the erosion of the Commons on the Internet, stand out. The theoretical approach comes from a decolonial ethical framework, and the methodology of this study is qualitative. It consists of, in the first phase of the implementation, two focus groups with engineering students between the ages of 19 and 22 from different semesters and genders. In a second phase, we include eight in-depth interviews with professors from the School of Engineering and the School of Humanities who teach disciplinary and general education subjects in two campuses of a private university in Mexico.},

  pages={984-995},
  abstract={The conventional mathematical models that are used for traffic distribution and traffic mode choice forecasts consider neither the individual heterogeneity on the micro level nor the changeable traffic scenes. This prompted us to propose a new forecast method composed of a traffic survey, an artificial transportation system (ATS), and computational experiments. We introduced a BDI modeling method in the agent-based ATS. This method considers an individual's psychological characteristics in combination with logical thinking, which was introduced to individual passenger agents, to deduce each passenger's decision-making process when choosing the traffic mode and route. A series of computational experiments were conducted on the ATS by using a school bus system as a case study to validate the feasibility and superiority of our method. Several computational experiments were conducted to predict the traffic distribution in normal and abnormal traffic scenarios and to analyze the extent to which each factor influences the travel modal split. Furthermore, the outcomes of various vehicle-scheduling plans were predicted and analyzed by using computational experiments to determine the optimal plan and support the establishment of transportation policies in the real world.},

  abstract={This Research to Practice Full Paper presents a pedagogical practice for technical high school students for developing Computational Thinking (CT) abilities through Internet of Things technologies. The covered topics in our proposal include (i) the use of temperature and humidity sensors for data collection, treatment and visualization using Arduino and micro-controllers; (ii) Smart and Human Cities (SHC) and Open Data concepts, in order to lead the students to reflect on the problems of their city and on data protection. Our motivation to our proposal is due to the educational processes have to develop criticality and the ability to solve problems among students. In this context, CT has been used for this through the use of robotics, game building or unplugged computing. On the other hand, technologies for implementing Internet of Things (IoT) have been used in several domains of society, including cities transformation. One important aspect in this scenario is data generation, which have to be carefully tackled by government's and who develop solutions to SHC. In this way, using IoT for teaching CT is an important aspect, also considering open data, privacy and SHC context. In our pedagogical practice, students were able to design and develop solutions to problems in their daily lives indirectly applying CT skills, such as decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, automation and analysis, as well as self-skills, collaboration, creativity and critically, required nowadays in broad professional training. It was also possible to develop students' interest in raising awareness of the use of computational technologies, as a solution to problems in society considering aspects of SHC and open data; propose a technological solution using IoT; and analyze the use of these data collected for the social well-being. For the evaluation of our proposal, we carried out questionnaires and tasks observation. The experience was considered successful in its planning and application, with a positive evaluation of the participating students.},

  abstract={In his recent writings, David Deutsch has argued that no progress in AGI is possible unless a breakthrough in philosophy will occur - a new epistemological theory explaining how brains create explanatory knowledge will be found. The purpose of the present paper is to present first ideas leading to such a theory within the framework of a high-level model of an embodied cognitive agent. In order to support creativity an agent must have the ability to draw and understand analogies which may be used in its otherwise standard reasoning processes in place of facts that served as the basis of the analogy. The use of analogies may then lead to the derivation of new explanatory knowledge in form of conjectures that can further become a subject of criticism, testing and adjustment or rejection. In the respective creative processes embodiment plays an indispensable role. We show that the existing model of an embodied cognitive agent designed recently by the author can serve as an explanatory model elucidating the mechanisms of creativity. Technically, the process of drawing analogies and their use in derivations of explanations can be seen as a means of mining new knowledge originally rooted in the environment. This can boost the computational power of cognitive systems above that of the classical Turing systems.},

  abstract={Its use in literary criticism might be one of the most novel opportunities to analyze texts and themes since artificial intelligence (AI) touches and improves every facet of human life. This paper has detailed issues on the application of AI-powered literary criticism and an overview of methodologies, applications, and implications accompanying the adoption of AI technologies. The paper starts with the context in which AI has actually emerged as one of the hot topics in literary studies, emanating from the crossroads of computational linguistics, natural language processing, and machine learning. “The true research opportunity that thus emerges from this work is the development of new AI technologies that can help supplement and augment traditional practices of literary analysis in such a way that scholars can get deeper into texts in search of the sorts of patterns and meanings that interest them. This paper presents illustrative examples and case studies in the applications of AI to literary criticism, which include sentiment analysis, topic modelling, and stylometric analysis. What these techniques afford researchers is a set of tools capable of processing large corpora of text with such accuracy and speed that identifying recurring motifs, characters dynamics, and thematic elements over genres, and literary periods is no problem. The following paper considers the ethical issues at the heart of AI-powered literary criticism, calling into question the algorithmic bias of authorship attribution and interpretive tasks it currently automates.},

  abstract={Every society has its own characteristics, shaped from time to time by the various innovative, disruptive, but in any case, dynamically changing mechanisms that affect it most. In today's society, technological innovation plays a major role in the development of individuals and their abilities. Education is the most typical and obvious arena for shaping, developing, and preparing for the challenges of the future. As in the leading sectors, in the world of education, rapid responses and immediate reactions to change significantly increase the ability to achieve and maintain success and thus marketability. As a sector responsible for developing the competences of individuals, building knowledge and training professionals, education should seek to keep pace with trends and break with traditional approaches and methods, so that, in addition to incorporating technological developments, a renewed approach to organizational development and methodology is an important means of achieving the desired success and effectiveness. In the course of our work, we provide a summary insight into the project work of student groups who require up-to-date IT skills, use advanced IT tools, plan, and implement their web development workflows supported by database management, front-end planning and design, and back-end programming with a project management approach according to the latest trends, interpreting the advantages and disadvantages of working methods for success.},

  abstract={Computational thinking (CT) based learning system is a significant tool for developing the cognitive ability and problem-solving skill both in real life and education. This research investigates the reduction of cognitive load in CT based learning system than non-computational (NCT) learning way more accurately after doing a particular task within a scheduled training. But for the measurement of the cognitive load instantly no platform is used before. To overcome this problem the ultimate goal of this paper is to construct a MATLAB GUI for immediately measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) based cognitive load individually. To measure the amount of cognitive load EEG signal was acquired from the two-class participants during the strategically question task and resting state. Preprocessing steps along with power spectral density were extracted to calculate the theta/beta ratio which strongly correlates with cognitive load. By seeing the fluctuation curve of theta beta ratio students learning ability can be determined. All these steps would be possible with the help of MATLAB GUI immediately by pushing button.},

  abstract={With the evolution of communication technologies, various substantial applications help the human community. Various real-time applications rely on the 5G era to fulfil the baseline service requirements. These 5G network communications deploy different cryptosystems to handle the security issues between homogeneous and heterogeneous systems. Here, a novel signcryption scheme is proposed over various public cryptosystems to secure communication among the 5G network model. The anticipated model establishes mutual communication among the certificate-less public key infra-structure environment. The proposed scheme works well against the chosen adaptive ciphertext attack under various computational random problems. A bilinear pairing-based signcryption (BPS) method is proposed and executed over the MATLAB 2020a simulation environment. This model is secure over the random model and establishes a better security trade-off among the prevailing approaches. Moreover, this model analyses and quantifies the scheme's performance with metrics like time comparison over a key generation, signcryption and unsigncryption. Therefore, the model attains superior security and efficiency.},
