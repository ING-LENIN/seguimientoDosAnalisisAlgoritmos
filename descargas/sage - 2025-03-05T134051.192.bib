abstract = {The constant emphasis on specialization produces university graduates who do not or cannot look at problems broadly. As a result, engineers, scientists and executives—indeed graduates in all fields—including the supposedly broad-based humanities—often cannot solve problems that require knowledge outside of their specializations. Or their narrowness causes them to commit embarrassing blunders that could be avoided if they took a broader view. The case of the British Westland Lysander P12 Ground Strafer aircraft illustrates the problem of narrow thinking. Very little direct information is available on this ingenious but obscure prototype airplane, but by examining many peripheral matters we can determine not only why the P12 was built but also how it was built. Further, we can also determine why it failed. Had the initial designers approached the problem in a broad way, and using information that was then available, they would have seen in advance that the project would fail. The case is instructive as an industrial problem, but it also demonstrates the value of global thinking methodology.}

abstract = {This study was aimed at investigating the role of IVI angle on the induced stresses and deformations among the components of the eye. Thereafter, the most optimal angle of IVI to minimize the complications of post IVI at the injection site on a basis of the computed stresses via a Fluid-Structure Interaction (FSI) computational model was proposed. IntraVitreal Injection (IVI) is broadly employed as a principal treatment of vascular vitro-retinal diseases. So far, there have been reports regarding the complications of post IVI and determine them as severe uveitis, tractional retinal detachment, IntraOcular Pressure (IOP) elevation as well as ocular haemorrhage. However, there is a lack of knowledge on how to reduce the subsequent ocular tissue damage and patient symptoms in the injection site. Seven different IVI angles were simulated, including 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90, through the Finite Element (FE) code; and the term, ‘post IVI complication’ or ‘injury’, in the results was interpreted as the level of maximal principal stress in the eye components. The results revealed the lowest amount of stresses at the angle of 45 in respect to the horizontal line (acute to the surface of the sclera) for the lens, iris, vitreous body, aqueous body, ciliary body, sclera, retina, and choroid. The cornea illustrated the same amount of stress at the angles of 45, 60, 75, and 90 with the highest one at the IVI angle of 30. The lowest and the highest stresses among the eye components regardless of IVI angle were observed in the choroid and retina/sclera, respectively, which imply the importance of the IVI angle on the stresses of these eye components. The findings of the contemporary research revealed that the IVI angle of 45 would trigger less post IVI complications and, as a result, a more effective surgery outcome compared to the other angles, i.e., 0, 15, 30, 60, 75, and 90.}

abstract = {Mismatch negativity (MMN) to pitch (pMMN) and to duration (dMMN) deviant stimuli is significantly more attenuated in long-term psychotic illness compared to first-episode psychosis (FEP). It was recently shown that source-modeling of magnetically recorded MMN increases the detection of left auditory cortex MMN deficits in FEP, and that computational circuit modeling of electrically recorded MMN also reveals left-hemisphere auditory cortex abnormalities. Computational modeling using dynamic causal modeling (DCM) can also be used to infer synaptic activity from EEG-based scalp recordings. We measured pMMN and dMMN with EEG from 26 FEP and 26 matched healthy controls (HCs) and used a DCM conductance-based neural mass model including α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid, N-methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA), and Gamma-aminobutyric acid receptors to identify any changes in effective connectivity and receptor rate constants in FEP. We modeled MMN sources in bilateral A1, superior temporal gyrus, and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). No model parameters distinguished groups for pMMN. For dMMN, reduced NMDA receptor activity in right IFG in FEP was detected. This finding is in line with literature of prefrontal NMDA receptor hypofunction in chronic schizophrenia and suggests impaired NMDA-induced synaptic plasticity may be present at psychosis onset where scalp dMMN is only moderately reduced. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of impaired NMDA receptor activity in FEP found through computational modeling of dMMN and shows the potential of DCM to non-invasively reveal synaptic-level abnormalities that underly subtle functional auditory processing deficits in early psychosis.}

abstract = {The mechanisms involved in the abnormal grain growth of the iron based oxide dispersion strengthened alloys are analysed in the present work. Its microstructural evolution takes place at high temperatures (0.9Tm) and is characterised by an initial submicrometre size microstructure and a strong < 110>|| rolling direction (RD) texture that evolves into a few extremely coarse grains (mm sizes) with < 112>||RD orientation. The analysis of the observed grain boundaries has been completed by molecular dynamics simulations. Microstructure evolution consists of an extended recovery process, followed by an abnormal grain growth stage, consequence of the orientation pinning mechanism and the proximity to a symmetric tilt boundary family between the < 110>||RD and < 112>||RD grains.}

abstract = {α-Amylase is one of the important enzymes in the starch-processing industry. However, starch processing requires high temperature, thus resulting in high cost. The high adsorptivity of α-amylase to the substrate allows this enzyme to digest the starch at a lower temperature. α-Amylase from Saccharomycopsis fibuligera R64 (Sfamy R64), a locally sourced enzyme from Indonesia, has a high amylolytic activity but low starch adsorptivity. The objective of this study was to design a computational model of Sfamy R64 with increased starch adsorptivity using bioinformatics method. The model structure of Sfamy R64 was compared with the positive control, ie, Aspergillus niger α-amylase. The structural comparison showed that Sfamy R64 lacks the surface-binding site (SBS). An SBS was introduced to the structure of Sfamy R64 by S383Y/S386W mutations. The dynamics and binding affinity of the SBS of mutant to the substrate were also improved and comparable with that of the positive control.}
