abstract = {Abstract This study was carried out to assess the ability of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code to predict the scavenging flow in the cylinder of a two-stroke cycle engine.

Boundary conditions for the CFD model were obtained from experimentally measured pressure-time histories in the crankcase and exhaust. The two-stroke cycle engine was modified to allow laser Doppler velocimetry (LDV) measurements to be made of the in-cylinder flow. The engine was operated under motoring conditions at 500 r/min with a delivery ratio of 0.7. Although the engine scavenge port layout was geometrically symmetrical, an asymmetrical flow field was identified in the cylinder. As a result of this, a direct comparison of the in-cylinder LDV measured and CFD computed results was not possible. However, LDV and CFD results for the in-cylinder flow are presented to help highlight the dissimilarity between the measured and predicted flow fields. Two-dimensional LDV measurements were made in the cylinder at the transfer ports for a portion of the cycle. A comparison of these LDV measurements with CFD predictions of the in-cylinder velocities at the same locations showed that the CFD model could replicate reasonably well the general trend of the flow.

abstract = {Group hole nozzles (GHN) are injector tips with clusters of small holes used in place of a single large hole. In this work, GHN with two holes per cluster and a diverging angle of 15° between the holes were studied using experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and comparisons were made with conventional diesel injectors. First, experiments were performed in a high temperature pressure vessel (HTPV) to understand the free spray behavior. HTPV experiments revealed that the diverging GHN had slower penetration with a more dispersed spray and a shorter lift-off length relative to the conventional injector. The GHN also exhibited higher natural luminosity compared to the conventional injector, which is indicative of increased soot formation with the GHN. CFD model validated with HTPV experimental data was used to study the sensitivity to the angle between the holes and the hole count per cluster. Results showed that soot formation increased as the divergence angle increased from 0° to 15°. Furthermore, as the divergence angle increased, increasing the hole count per cluster increased the soot formation significantly. Following the HTPV study, the injectors were tested on a single-cylinder heavy-duty diesel engine at a high-load operating condition. Results showed that the diverging GHN injector produced a lower mixing-controlled combustion rate compared to the conventional injector. The slower burn rates resulted in lower NOx and higher soot emissions for the diverging GHN injector. CFD simulations of the engine experiments predicted the slower burn rate seen with the diverging GHN injector. In-cylinder visualization of the CFD results showed that slower penetration with the diverging GHN results in reduced mixing upon surface interaction, and an inability to utilize the fresh air in the outer regions of the combustion chamber which resulted in richer local equivalence ratios and higher soot emissions compared to the conventional injector.}

abstract = {In this study, to define the distribution of CO2 and methanol concentration in the anode channel, three-dimensional (3D) two-phase homogeneous computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modelling for the anode channel and one-dimensional (1D) two-phase mathematical modelling for the porous media have been considered. In the anode channel, two flow configurations, single-serpentine flow field (SSFF), and parallel flow field (PFF) were studied. Here also, the effects of inlet mass flowrate, flow configurations, inlet temperature of aqueous solution, and inlet feed concentration on the CO2 concentration in the anode channel and cell performance have been investigated. To define the interface boundary conditions between the channel and diffuser layers, the CFD modelling of the anode channel was coupled with the mathematical modelling in the porous media. The results show that the corner of the channel rib is the proper site for coalescence of CO2 gas bubbles. The finer distribution of methanol concentration and less number of gas bubbles at the SSFF configuration have been observed. This leads to a better performance of the cell in the SSFF configuration relative to the PFF configuration. With increase of the mass flowrate, the molar concentration of CO2 (gas bubbles) reduces and the cell performance improves. With increase in the temperature of aqueous methanol solution, cell performance will improve. The main reasons should be attributed to the enhanced activity of the catalyst and increase of diffusion coefficient of the methanol solution. The CO2 gas bubbles will emerge more at higher temperatures, but it is clear that the effect of enhanced activity of the catalyst and increase of the diffusion coefficient of the methanol surmounts that of numerous CO2 gas bubbles, thus leading to the improvement of the cell performance.}

abstract = {The paper assesses the effect on the air flow regime underneath a simplified high-speed train of changing the ballast depth and the sleeper shape, with regard to its potential for causing ballast flight or pickup. The study was carried out numerically using the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software AnSys Fluent. The flow profile beneath the underbody of the train was generated by means of a moving wall above the track. The Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES) with the SST turbulence model was used to simulate turbulent flow, and the ballast bed roughness was applied parametrically using the wall roughness feature when resolving the boundary layer. CFD simulations were validated for flow over a cube, showing good agreement with experimental results. Up to three different depths to the ballast surface and three different sleeper profiles were investigated. Velocity profiles and aerodynamic forces on cubes placed between or on top of the sleeper blocks were used to assess the propensity of individual ballast grains for movement. For a standard G44 sleeper, increasing the ballast depth and/or the ballast bed roughness was found to reduce aerodynamic loads on an individual ballast grain. A ballast grain on top of the sleeper is more prone to uplift than a grain on the surface of the ballast bed in the crib. A curved upper surface to the sleeper is beneficial in that it prevents ballast from settling on top, the most vulnerable position. However, the reduced flow separation associated with the curved top may increase the likelihood of ballast pickup from the crib. Hence new sleeper shapes intended to reduce the potential for ballast flight should not only prevent ballast from settling on top, but also increase flow separation through the provision of a sharp surface. A prismatic sleeper shape that achieves both is suggested.}

abstract = {The purpose of the 427M Improvement Program is to replace and update the computer, communications, and display facility used to support the North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) and the Aerospace Defense Command in accomplishing their assigned missions, through 1980. The interface between the human operators and the several complete computer systems of the Space Computational Center (SCC) and NORAD is the Interactive Display Console. The SCC/NCS (NORAD Computer System) Graphic Display Console must meet specific Air Force readability, look-angle, accessibility, and maintenance requirements, as well as the restrictive space, weight, and power requirements. Both the SCC and NCS display presentations require extensive use of display vectors to construct maps and backgrounds in addition to presenting the data. The problems of legibility require evaluating the advantages of stroke-generation techniques over the raster-scan technology in producing straight, clearly defined vectors. Also, the system requires a highly reliable, modularly expandable, high-throughput system which would apply to both the SCC and NCS man/machine interface requirements. To effectively maintain the display console hardware, it should be identical for both the SCC and NCS segments; however, the segments must be addressable for different functional operations and displayed information. Thus the operational parameters were assigned to software programs. Functions of the SCC include space catalog maintenance, space sensor system status, space weapons support, system control and support, programming support, and personnel subsystem support. To perform these functions within the allowable time constraints, a highly automated and highly interactive computer system is needed. The Human Factors role in console definition, man/computer interface considerations, and facility layout problems will be discussed in the paper.}
