N2 - A methodology is presented for computing the spread of fire effects such as heat, smoke, and other combustion products between rooms in a multi-room fire scenario. The methodology extends the Harvard Computer Fire Code V for computing the dynamic history of a fire in a single room to connecting rooms by adding the appropriate flow physics. Finally, an example is presented where an object is burning in a room which is connected to a second room via a door way. The evolution of the hot layer and vent flows are discussed, and compared to the same evolution of a single room structure.

N2 - The paper suggests a focused examination of the processes of drafting-based design and parametric design in urbanism. It discusses how spatial design’s settled cognition would differ by using algorithmic systems through the altered relationships between the basic operations in design. To reveal the commonalities and distinctions between the two design methods, the authors present the detailed documentation of the workshop series, which experimented with both techniques within similar design contexts. By the design analysis, the idea of “parametric thinking” is revisited in the specific context of urban design.

N2 - Although desktop computers have been considered in many computational fluid dynamics (CFD) indoor simulations, they were usually simplified as hot boxes. A real desktop computer, however, is not only a heat source but also a momentum source due to the jet airflow generated by the computer case fan. The airflow induced by a desktop case fan could have the same order of magnitude as the ventilation rate of the whole room, and thus is expected to have significant influence upon the indoor airflow field and distribution of contaminants. Obviously, the simplification of desktop computer into a hot box does not sufficiently stand for the actual situation. In this study, a CFD model of a typical office room was built and simulations were conducted to investigate the airflow field and volatile organic compounds (VOC) distribution under two scenarios: (1) computer as a ‘hot box’ without a fan and (2) a more realistic computer model with an operating case fan. The comparison of CFD results yielded from these two scenarios demonstrated that the role of computer fan is very important in terms of airflow field and contaminant distribution and should be included in CFD office simulations for the purpose of improved reliability.

N2 - With the tremendous growth of science and technology in the world, the silent submarine has been an interesting research topic for many years. What is of equal interest is how to produce a high-speed submarine that limits noise to minimise detection from the enemy. In this study, we investigated the combination of a propeller and a duct so that when a submarine is operated, it minimises as much as possible the noise without affecting the speed of the submarine. The goal of installing the duct outside the propeller is to reduce the noise and loss of thrust simultaneously. The purpose of this article is to investigate the variation of the magnitude of the noise and thrust that occurs when a submarine propeller is operated in six different types of ducts. The research method is to use the large eddy simulation method with the cavitation model and then to calculate the result using the finite volume method. The study found that Ducts 1 and 4 have a better noise reduction effect and better propulsion than the other four ducts. Among them, Duct 4 has the best noise reduction effect, and Duct 1 provides the maximum propulsion. In all of the computation examples herein, the cavitation phenomenon did not occur. In the future, we will continue to study the growth and decline of related physical quantities with various types of propellers and ducts.

N2 - As digital platforms have come to play a central role in the news and information ecosystem, a new realm of watchdog journalism has emerged – the platform beat. Journalists on the platform beat report on the operation, use and misuse of social media platforms and search engines. The platform beat can serve as an important mechanism for increasing the accountability of digital platforms, in ways that can affect public trust in the platforms, but that can also, hopefully, lead to the development of stronger, more reliable, and ultimately more trustworthy, platforms. However, there are a number of tensions, vulnerabilities and potential conflicts of interest that characterize the platform beat. This article explores these complex dynamics of the platform beat in an effort assess the capacity of those on the platform beat to enhance the accountability and trustworthiness of digital platforms.
