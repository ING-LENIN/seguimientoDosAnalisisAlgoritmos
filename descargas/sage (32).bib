abstract = {Computational design affords agency: the ability to orchestrate the material, spatial, and technical architectural system. In this specific case, it occurs through enhanced, authored means to facilitate making and performance—typically driven by concerns of structural optimization, material use, and responsivity to environmental factors—of an atmospheric rather than social nature. At issue is the positioning of this particular manner of agency solely with the architect auteur. This abruptly halts—at the moment in which fabrication commences—the ability to amend, redefine, or newly introduce fundamentally transformational constituents and their interrelationships and, most importantly, to explore the possibility for extraordinary outcomes. When the architecture becomes a functional, social, and cultural entity, in the hands of the idealized abled-bodied user, agency—especially for one of an otherly body or mind—is long gone. Even an empathetic auteur may not be able to access the motivations of the differently-abled body and neuro-divergent mind, effectively locking the constraints of the design process, which creates an exclusionary system to those beyond the purview of said auteur. It can therefore be deduced that the mechanisms or authors of a conventional computational design process cannot eradicate the exclusionary reality of an architectural system. Agency is critical, yet a more expansive terminology for agent and agency is needed. The burden to conceive of capacities that will always be highly temporal, social, unpredictable, and purposefully unknown must be shifted far from the scope of the traditional directors of the architectural system. Agency, and who it is conferred upon, must function in a manner that dissolves the distinctions between the design, the action of designing, the author of design, and those subjected to it.}

abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to examine the structure and development of algebraic thinking across multiple dimensions. An algebraic thinking test was administered to 803 students aged 10–13 years old. One hundred and one students of different performance outcomes in the algebraic thinking test participated in semi-structured clinical interviews in order to develop further insights into students’ strategies and difficulties. The results confirmed the multifaceted nature of algebraic thinking and showed that algebraic thinking consists of three aspects: reasoning about covariation, generalization of arithmetic properties and abilities directly related to algebraic syntax. Each one of these aspects is composed of specific algebraic thinking abilities, such as modelling relations using algebraic symbols. Four groups of students of different algebraic thinking profiles were identified: ‘pre-algebraic’, ‘protoalgebraic-procedural’, ‘relational-symbolic algebraic thinking’ and ‘structural-global algebraic thinking’. The results also supported the presence of a consistent trend in the difficulty level across the algebraic thinking abilities, which suggests a specific developmental trend from a more procedural perspective of algebraic thinking to a more structural one.}

abstract = {The need to partition or discretize numeric value ranges arises in machine learning and data mining algorithms. This subtask is a potential time-consumption bottleneck, since the number of candidate partitions is exponential in the number of possible cut points in the range. Thus, many heuristic algorithms have been proposed for this task. Recently, the efficiency of optimal multisplitting has improved dramatically, due to the introduction of linear-time algorithms for training error minimization and quadratic-time generic algorithms. Whether these efficient algorithms are the best obtainable, is not yet known. In this paper, we probe the inherent complexity of the multisplitting problem. We reflect results obtained for similar problems in computational geometry and string matching to the multisplitting task. Subquadratic optimization algorithms in computational geometry rely on the monotonicity of the optimized function. We show by counterexamples that the widely used evaluation functions Training Set Error and Average Class Entropy do not satisfy the kind of monotonicity that facilitates subquadratic-time optimization. However, we also show that the Training Set Error function can be decomposed into monotonic subproblems, one per class, which explains its linear time optimization. Finally, we review recently developed techniques for speeding up optimal multisplitting.}

abstract = {Background The creation and management of an autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as vascular access (VA) for hemodialysis patients is still a critical procedure. The placement of a functional and long-lasting VA derives from adequate planning of the surgical procedure based on physical examination, vascular mapping and selection of the best modality for arteriovenous anastomosis. The risk of AVF non-maturation and early failure is high, even when all precautions are taken to minimize these events. In addition, AVF surgery may develop very high blood flow exposing the patient to the risk of heart failure or hand ischemia. Methods The choices of the surgeons on the modalities to perform a surgical intervention for AVF should take into consideration several factors including patient clinical condition, arterial and venous vessel sizes and elasticity. However, these evaluations cannot give direct indication on VA outcome in terms of blood flow after AVF maturation. We then took advantage of theoretical models of vascular network hemodynamics and of computational fluid dynamics to develop a numerical tool for the prediction of potential blood flow of a planned VA surgery on the basis of preoperative ultrasound evaluation of arterial and venous sizes and blood flow. Results Here we present the numerical model, previously developed and tested, and we describe the web-based application that has been developed to help during surgical planning. Conclusions The use of this tool in the clinical setting should allow to reduce the incidence of AVF non-maturation as well as incidence of VA complications.}

abstract = {In informal argument, an essential step is to ask what will “resonate” with a particular audience and hence persuade. Marketers, for example, may recommend a certain colour for a new soda can because it “pops” on Instagram; politicians may “fine-tune” diction for different social demographics. This paper engages the need to strategise for such resonance by offering a method for automating opposition analysis (OA), a technique from semiotics used in marketing and literary analysis to plot objects of interest on oppositional axes. Central to our computational approach is a reframing of texts as proxies for thought and opposition as the product of oscillation in thought in response to those proxies, a model to which the contextual similarity information contained in word embeddings is relevant. We illustrate our approach with an analysis of texts on gun control from ProCon.org, implementing a three-step method to: 1) identify relatively prominent signifiers; 2) rank possible opposition pairs on prominence and contextual similarity scores; and 3) derive plot values for proxies on opposition pair axes. The results are discussed in terms of strategies for informal argument that might be derived by those on each side of gun control.}
