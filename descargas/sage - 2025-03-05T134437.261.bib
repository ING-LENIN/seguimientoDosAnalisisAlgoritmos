N2 - This ethnographic case investigates the relationship between the daily organizing work of one education technology “intermediary organization” (IO) in Silicon Valley, California and federal education technology policies. I argue that the IO constructed policy knowledge that reified discourses of “digital meritocracy”: a belief in digital technologies as a means of evaluating individual success, regardless of historic, place-based material inequities. To develop this concept, I trace themes of “personalization” and “everywhere” as they emerge in the IO’s daily work and in federal education technology policies. This study extends research on IOs as “brokers” of information, resources, and social ties between public schools and private service providers and argues that IOs also construct “policy knowledge,” or “definitions of what counts as education.”

N2 - The prediction of wave resistance in naval architecture is an important aspect especially at high Froude numbers where a great percentage of total resistance of ships and submerged bodies is caused by waves. In addition, during hull form optimization, wave resistance characteristics of a ship must closely be observed. There are potential, viscous and experimental methods to determine the wave resistance of a ship. Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equation–based methods usually follow the experimental method that determines the form factor first. However, it is proven in recent studies that the form factor changes with the Reynolds number. As the Reynolds number increases, this change in the form factor is being neglected. In this study, a Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equation–based prediction of wave resistance is presented that overcomes this flaw. The methodology is validated with the benchmark problems of submerged and surface-piercing bodies to determine the effectiveness of the proposed method. The method is also validated by experiments carried out at the Ata Nutku Ship Model Testing Laboratory of Istanbul Technical University for a totally submerged ellipsoid and the benchmark KRISO Containership. Results reveal the robustness of the present methodology.

N2 - In this paper, an outline of mean-field homogenization and fracture toughness of boron nitride nanotube-reinforced aluminium and epoxy composites have been presented. The meso-scale material modelling has been achieved using Mori-Tanaka and double inclusion homogenization schemes. To examine the effectiveness of Mori-Tanaka and double inclusion schemes, a comparison has been drawn with the rule of mixture. Meso-scale numerical results of boron nitride nanotube-reinforced aluminium and epoxy composites are presented for various design parameters such as aspect ratio and volume fraction of boron nitride nanotubes. The validation studies of the developed transversely isotropic composites model have been documented with the experiments performed and existing literature. Finally, macro-scale fracture toughness simulations incorporating the transversely isotropic properties have been performed using the domain integral method. It is observed that aluminium and epoxy with elastoplastic and viscoelastic nature, respectively, have shown a significant effect on the fracture properties of the composites.

N2 - Continuum damage mechanics models have been used for predicting failure in composites for several years now. However, their application to natural fibre composites is quite recent. In this work, an approach for evaluating damage processes in natural fibre composite has been developed by combining experimentally quantified damage rules with discrete representations of fabric geometry. This approach is demonstrated by predicting the tensile failure of both thermoplastic-based and thermoset-based flax fabric composites. Numerical models have been developed to estimate the damage rules from the fibre, matrix and interface properties incorporated into representative volume element (RVE) models of the composites. While both the experimentally quantified and numerically obtained sets of damage rules yield satisfactory predictions, the use of these numerical rules leads to predictions that are close to, and in some cases, better than those obtained from the quantified rules.

N2 - Background The aim of this study was to evaluate the rheolytic effects of stenting a mid-shaft/distal left main coronary artery (LMCA) lesion with and without ostial coverage. Stenting of the LMCA has emerged as a valid alternative in place of traditional coronary bypass graft surgery. However, in case of mid-shaft/distal lesion, there is no consensus regarding the extension of the strut coverage up to the ostium or to stent only the culprit lesion. Methods We reconstructed a left main-left descending coronary artery (LM-LCA)-left circumflex (LCX) bifurcation after analysing 100 consecutive patients (mean age 71.4 ± 9.3, 49 males) with LM mid-shaft/distal disease. The mean diameter of proximal LM, left anterior descending (LAD) and LCX, evaluated with quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) was 4.62 ± 0.86 mm, 3.31 ± 0.92 mm, and 2.74 ± 0.93 mm, respectively. For the stent simulation, a third-generation, everolimus-eluting stent was virtually reconstructed. Results After virtual stenting, the net area averaged wall shear stress (WSS) of the model and the WSS at the LCA-LCX bifurcation resulted higher when the stent covered the culprit mid-shaft lesion only compared with the extension of the stent covering the ostium (3.68 versus 2.06 Pa, p = 0.01 and 3.97 versus 1.98 Pa, p < 0.001, respectively. Similarly, the static pressure and the Reynolds number were significantly higher after stent implantation covering up the ostium. At the ostium, the flow resulted more laminar when stenting only the mid-shaft lesion than including the ostium. Conclusions Although these findings cannot be translated directly into real practice our brief study suggests that stenting lesion 1:1 or extending the stent to cover the LM ostium impacts differently the rheolytic properties of LMCA bifurcation with potential insights for restenosis or thrombosis.

N2 - Five kinds of data were gathered on various groups of college females who differ in their approach to and success in solving problems. Ss high and low on intuitiveness and on success, as defined here, were studied in some detail Usual measures of intellectual capacity and standard personality measures discriminated only slightly between the groups, but more detailed study of the personality scales, interviews, and self-concept materials revealed these groups to have clearly distinguishable patterns of personality characteristics.
