abstract = {Ceramic-on-ceramic hip resurfacing can potentially offer the bone-conserving advantages of resurfacing while eliminating metal ion release. Thin-walled ceramic resurfacing heads are conceivable following developments in the strength and reliability of ceramic materials, but verification of new designs is required. The present study aimed to develop a mechanical pre-clinical analysis verification process for ceramic resurfacing heads, using the DeltaSurf prosthesis design as a case study. Finite element analysis of a range of in vivo scenarios was used to design a series of physiologically representative mechanical tests, which were conducted to verify the strength of the prosthesis. Tests were designed to simulate ideal and worst-case in vivo loading and support, or to allow comparison with a clinically successful metallic device. In tests simulating ideal loading and support, the prosthesis sustained a minimum load of 39 kN before fracture, and survived 10 000 000 fatigue cycles of 0.534 kN to 5.34 kN. In worst-case tests representing a complete lack of superior femoral head bone support or pure cantilever loading of the prosthesis stem, the design demonstrated strength comparable to that of the equivalent metal device. The developed mechanical verification test programme represents an improvement in the state of the art where international test standards refer largely to total hip replacement prostheses. The case study’s novel prosthesis design performed with considerable safety margins compared with extreme in vivo loads, providing evidence that the proposed ceramic resurfacing heads should have sufficient strength to perform safely in vivo. Similar verification tests should be designed and conducted for novel ceramic prosthesis designs in the future, leading the way to clinical evaluation.}

abstract = {Distal femoral fractures associated with the femoral stem in a well-fixed hip arthroplasty pose a risk of an interprosthetic fracture, the treatment of which is known as difficult. To effectively prevent and treat IP fractures, biomechanical effects must be demonstrated. We defined eight variations of the interprosthetic distance ranging from 48 mm overlap to 128 mm gap. Femoral geometries with normal and reduced cortical thickness were modeled to evaluate the effects of cortical thickness. In addition to the intact model, a total of 16 finite element models were analyzed under physiological boundary conditions. Maximum and minimum principal strains on the lateral and medial cortex surfaces were always found to be greater in models with reduced cortical thickness than in normal femurs. The model with 48 mm overlapping interprosthetic distance produced the least peak strain and the model with 16 mm interprosthetic gap produced the greatest strain with both normal and reduced cortical thickness. The screw holes produced local strain concentrations and increased the peak strains on the cortex surfaces, especially close to the stem tip. Statistically, a significant correlation (R2 = 0.9483) was found between strain shielding and interprosthetic distance. Axial stiffness, interfragmentary shear motion, and maximum von-Mises stress on the distal plate showed a high correlation with the interprosthetic distance. It was concluded that the overlapping structures are superior to other fixations we analyzed in that they offer better mechanical stability and eliminates the local strain concentrations.}

abstract = {The tribological characteristic of journal bearing systems can be enhanced with the integrating of textures in the contact interfaces, or using the lubricating effect of non-Newtonian fluids. In this study, the combined effects of bearing surface texturing and non-Newtonian lubricants behavior, using micropolar fluid model, on static characteristics of hydrodynamic circular journal bearings of finite length are highlighted. The modified Reynolds equation of micropolar lubrication theory is solved using finite differences scheme and Elrod’s mass conservation algorithm, taking into account the presence of the cylindrical texture shape on full and optimum bearing surfaces. The optimization textured area is carried out through particle swarm optimization algorithm, in order to increase the load lifting capacity. Preliminary results are in good agreement with the reference ones, and present an enhancement in the performances of micro-textured journal bearings (load carrying capacity and friction). The results suggest that texturing the bearing convergent zone significantly increases the load carrying capacity and reduce friction coefficient, while fully texturing causes bad performances. It is also shown that the micropolar fluids exhibit better performances for smooth journal bearings than a Newtonian fluid depending on the size of material characteristic length and the coupling number. The combined effects of fully surface textured with micropolar fluids reduce the performance of journal bearing, especially at lower eccentricity ratios. Considering the optimal arrangement of textures on the contact surface, a significant improvement in terms of load capacity and friction can be achieved, particularly at high eccentricity ratios, high material characteristic lengths and high values of the coupling numbers of micropolar fluids.}
