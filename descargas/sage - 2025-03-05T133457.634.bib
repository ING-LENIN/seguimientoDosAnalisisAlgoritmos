N2 - We report on our experiences in building a computational environment for tomographic image analysis for marine seismologists studying the structure and evolution of mid- ocean ridge volcanism. The computational environment is determined by an evolving set of requirements for this problem domain and includes needs for high performance parallel computing, large data analysis, model visualiza tion, and computation interaction and control. Although these needs are not unique in scientific computing, the integration of techniques for seismic tomography with tools for parallel computing and data analysis into a com putational environment was (and continues to be) an interesting, important learning experience for researchers in both disciplines. For the geologists, the use of the environment led to fundamental geologic discoveries on the East Pacific Rise, the improvement of parallel ray-trac ing algorithms, and a better regard for the use of compu tational steering in aiding model convergence. The com puter scientists received valuable feedback on the use of programming, analysis, and visualization tools in the en vironment. In particular, the tools for parallel program data query (DAQV) and visualization programming (Viz) were demonstrated to be highly adaptable to the problem do main. We discuss the requirements and the components of the environment in detail. Both accomplishments and limitations of our work are presented.

N2 - This paper examines the prevalence of bias in artificial intelligence text-to-image models utilized in the architecture and design disciplines. The rapid pace of advancements in machine learning technologies, particularly in text-to-image generators, has significantly increased over the past year, making these tools more accessible to the design community. Accordingly, this paper aims to critically document and analyze the collective, computational, and cognitive biases that designers may encounter when working with these tools at this time. The paper delves into three hierarchical levels of operation and investigates the possible biases present at each level. Starting with the training data for large language models (LLM), the paper explores how these models may create biases privileging English-language users and perspectives. The paper subsequently investigates the digital materiality of models and how their weights generate specific aesthetic results. Finally, the report concludes by examining user biases through their prompt and image selections and the potential for platforms to perpetuate these biases through the application of user data during training.

N2 - Approaches to modeling social phenomena vary on a continuum from simple models, in which causality is clear and parameters few, to realistic, high-fidelity models designed to capture the most detailed system behavior possible in a specific setting. Anthropologists have produced both simple and high-fidelity models. The focus of this article is on high-fidelity modeling in anthropology and the special challenge its complexity presents for model comparison. Useful model comparison requires docking, or rendering models comparable, and the author presents a framework for docking based on the work of Axelrod, and Cioffi-Revilla and Gotts. Docking not only renders models more comparable, allowing for more traditional theory testing, but it also sharpens the discussion about the ontology of anthropological phenomena and how they are best represented as theories and models.

N2 - The conventional rotor spinning unit generates flow vortices in the transfer channel upstream region which affect the fiber configuration and consequently yarn properties. Geometry and spinning parameters such as transfer channel length, inlet width, rotor outlet pressure, opening roller speed, and diameter were found to be key parameters influencing airflow characteristics. To reduce the flow vortices in the upper stream region, modifications of the transfer channel were proposed, and their airflow fields were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. Three designs were studied: a round transfer channel inlet, a bypass channel for extra air supply, and one with both the bypass and the round inlet. Analysis of airflow revealed that the design with both round transfer channel inlet and a bypass proved to be very effective in properly directing the flow and minimizing vortices. The design was also characterized by smoother velocity streamlines and maximum mass flow across the transfer channel. A conventional rotor spinning unit was modified in which a round transfer channel inlet corner and a bypass channel were utilized to conduct the experimental tests. Three sets of yarn samples were produced using the conventional and modified rotor spinning units under different rotor speed conditions. Yarn properties were tested. Properties such as tenacity, CVm%, and thin and thick places of the spun yarns produced by the new design improved compared to that of the conventional yarn.

N2 - Purpose A-v anastomosis entails dramatic changes in hemodynamic conditions, which may lead to major alterations to the vessels involved; primarily dilatations and devastating stenoses. Wall shear stress is thought to play a key role in the remodeling of the vessels exposed to abnormal levels and oscillating wall shear stress. In this study we sought to develop a framework suitable for thorough in vivo analyses of wall shear stress and vessel morphology of a-v fistulas in patients. Methods Using ultrasound and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) transverse image stacks from six patient a-v fistulas were obtained. From the image stacks three-dimensional geometries of the patient fistulas were created using dedicated segmentation software. Geometries of three a-v fistulas were imported into Finite Element software in order to perform fluid flow simulations of blood flows and frictional forces on the vessel walls in the a-v fistulas. Boundary conditions for the simulations were obtained using both a MRI Phase Contrast and an Ultrasound Doppler technique. Results The segmentation of the six fistulas of very different age and morphology (two end-to-side and four side-to-side) showed the ability of the approach to create geometries of various fistula morphologies. Simulations of the three fistulas showed an instant picture of the present status of the exposure to different levels of wall shear stress and the morphological status in the vessel remodeling process. Conclusion The study demonstrated the capability of the CFD framework to analyze patient a-v fistulas on a regular basis using both MRI and ultrasound-based approaches.

N2 - Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based automated depression diagnosis systems have been suggested for early and accurate detection of mood disorders. EEG signals are highly irregular, nonlinear, and nonstationary in nature and are traditionally studied from a linear viewpoint by means of statistical and frequency features. Since, linear metrics present certain limitations and nonlinear methods have proven to be an efficient tool in understanding the complexities of the brain in the identification of underlying behavior of biological signals, such as electrocardiogram, EEG and magnetoencephalogram and thus, can be applied to all nonstationary signals. Various nonlinear algorithms can be used in the analysis of EEG signals. In this research paper, we aim to develop a novel methodology for EEG-based depression diagnosis utilizing 2 advanced computational techniques: frequency-domain extended multivariate autoregressive (eMVAR) and deep learning (DL). We proposed a hybrid method comprising a pretrained ResNet-50 and long-short term memory (LSTM) to capture depression-specific information and compared with a strong conventional machine learning (ML) framework having eMVAR connectivity features. The following 8 causality measures, which interpret the interaction mechanisms among spectrally decomposed oscillations, were used to extract features from multivariate EEG time series: directed coherence (DC), directed transfer function (DTF), partial DC (PDC), generalized PDC (gPDC), extended DC (eDC), delayed DC (dDC), extended PDC (ePDC), and delayed PDC (dPDC). The classification accuracies were 84% with DC, 85% with DTF, 95.3% with PDC, 95.1% with gPDC, 84.8% with eDC, 84.6% with dDC, 84.2% with ePDC, and 95.9% with dPDC for the eMVAR framework. Through a DL framework (ResNet-50 + LSTM), the classification accuracy was achieved as 90.22%. The results demonstrate that our DL methodology is a competitive alternative to the strong feature extraction-based ML methods in depression classification.
