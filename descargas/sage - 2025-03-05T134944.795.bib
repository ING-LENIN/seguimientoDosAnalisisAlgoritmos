N2 - In this article, we present a study focused on developing students’ understanding the ecology through participation in a technology-supported urban planning simulation—specifically, 11 high school students in Madison, Wisconsin acted as urban planners to redesign a local shopping street using a Geographic Information System (GIS) model. This experimental design was situated within the theory of pedagogical praxis, which suggests that modeling learning environments on authentic professional practices enables youth to develop a deeper understanding of important domains of inquiry (Shaffer, 2004). Results presented here suggest that through participation in the project students: a) developed an understanding of ecology; and b) developed this understanding through the urban planning practices and the features of the GIS model used during the project. Thus, we propose that this augmented by reality learning environment modeled on the professional practices of urban planners extends the theory of pedagogical praxis into the domain of ecology and offers a useful method for developing ecological understanding through participation in simulations that incorporate the authentic tools and practices of urban planning.

N2 - This article introduces the concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to a criminological audience. After a general review of the phenomenon (including brief explanations of important cognate fields such as ‘machine learning’, ‘deep learning’, and ‘reinforcement learning’), the paper then turns to the potential application of AI by criminals, including what we term here ‘crimes with AI’, ‘crimes against AI’, and ‘crimes by AI’. In these sections, our aim is to highlight AI’s potential as a criminogenic phenomenon, both in terms of scaling up existing crimes and facilitating new digital transgressions. In the third part of the article, we turn our attention to the main ways the AI paradigm is transforming policing, surveillance, and criminal justice practices via diffuse monitoring modalities based on prediction and prevention. Throughout the paper, we deploy an array of programmatic examples which, collectively, we hope will serve as a useful AI primer for criminologists interested in the ‘tech-crime nexus’.

N2 - This article reports on a year-long study of high school students learning computer programming. The study examined three issues: 1) what is the impact of programming on particular mathematical and reasoning abilities?; 2) what cognitive skills or abilities best predict programming ability?; and 3) what do students actually understand about programming after two years of high school study? The results showed that even after two years of study, many students had only a rudimentary understanding of programming. Consequently, it was not surprising to also find that programming experience (as opposed to expertise) does not appear to transfer to other domains which share analogous formal properties. The article concludes that we need to more closely study the pedagogy of programming and how expertise can be better attained before we prematurely go looking for significant and wide reaching transfer effects from programming.

N2 - Information technology and computer science represent one area of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) that have experienced significant growth in recent years. As such, federal policy has urged schools to embed new types of STEM courses into the curriculum. As one very prominent example, computer science (CS)-focused courses are a growing branch of career and technical education (CTE)—that is, CS-CTE. While previous research has examined coursetaking patterns and subsequent outcomes of CS-CTE courses for the general student population, little is known about how participation in these courses may benefit students with learning disabilities (SWLDs). From a pedagogical perspective, CS-CTE courses, and CTE courses in general, may be uniquely positioned to improve schooling outcomes for SWLDs. Using data from the nationally representative High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, we explored characteristics of CS-CTE participants, how CS-CTE may promote the development of key STEM attitudes (e.g., identity, self-efficacy, and utility), and how any relationships may differ by learning disability status. Using a double propensity score matching estimations, we found CS-CTE participation related to positive development of STEM identity and STEM self-efficacy for students without learning disabilities. For the SWLD population, CS-CTE participation was associated with growth in STEM self-efficacy and STEM utility. Policy implications discuss the gap in computer science employment between SWLDs and non-SWLDs, the prevalence of state-related computer science policies, and how to continue to promote STEM identity growth.

N2 - Science and technology studies (STS) and the emerging field of data science share surprising elective affinities. At the growing intersections of these fields, there will be many opportunities and not a few thorny difficulties for STS scholars. First, I discuss how both fields frame the rollout of data science as a simultaneously social and technical endeavor, even if in distinct ways and for diverging purposes. Second, I discuss the logic of domains in contemporary computer, information, and data science circles. While STS is often agnostic about the borders between the sciences or with industry and state—occasionally taking those boundaries as an object of study—data science takes those boundaries as its target to overcome. These two elective affinities present analytic and practical challenges for STS but also opportunities for engagement. Overall, in addition to these typifications, I urge STS scholars to strategically position themselves to investigate and contribute to the breadth of transformations that seek to touch virtually every science and newly bind spheres of academy, industry, and state.

N2 - This article investigates the motivations of African American and Latino girls (N = 41) who navigate urban Southwest school districts during the day, but voluntarily attend a 2-year, culturally responsive multimedia program after school and into the summer. Understanding that girls from economically disadvantaged settings are indeed motivated to become technological innovators but often do not have access to the necessary resources to follow their interest, our program—entitled COMPUGIRLS—assumes a culturally responsive computing approach. This research examines particular features of the program (e.g., asset building, reflections, and connectedness) that attracted and retained the Latina (74%) and African American (19%) adolescent (ages 13-18) participants as well as to what extent the culturally relevant aspects of the curriculum assist with program retention and/or affect the students’ vision of themselves as a future technologist. An evaluative approach gathered 2 years of data from the participants. Field notes from observations and interviews were transcribed and reviewed to extract themes and areas of convergence. As a standpoint theory project, the authors center the girls’ voices as the primary data sources. Two primary themes emerged from the data to explain girls’ sustained motivation. The first was the challenge of learning and mastering the technology. For many, this also included disproving the stereotypes of their abilities by age, gender, and race. The second theme was being able to manipulate technology and learning experiences as a means of self-expression and research, particularly if the results could be used to inform their community and peers. The authors posit that much of the program impact was because of the culturally responsive practices (asset building, reflection, and connectedness) embedded within the curriculum. Implications for urban educators and program developers are considered.

N2 - The business model of architecture has been accused of being technologically deficient. Through case studies, this paper investigates alternatives to the status quo of computation in architecture, with a focus on design-oriented service providers. It first examines the discourse on computation within the field, then describes the experiments of a relevant design firm before discussing implications for the wider industry. In the process, the paper articulates the gap between theoretical computing applications and the realities of the architecture business. It addresses difficult technological adaptations within the industry with concrete use cases of integrated computing expertise, highlighting opportunities, benefits, and, more importantly, the need for a computational workforce.
