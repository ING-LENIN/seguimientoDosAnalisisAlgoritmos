abstract = {It has been hypothesized that the muscular efforts exerted during standing may be altered by changes in personal factors, such as the body stature and muscular strength. The goal of this work was to assess the contribution of leg muscles using a biomechanical model in different physical conditions and various initial postures. An optimized inverse dynamics model was employed to find the maximum muscular effort in 23,040 postures. The simulation results showed that mid-range knee flexion could help the healthy and strong individuals maintain balance, but those with weaker muscle strength required more knee flexion. Individuals of weak muscular constitution as well as those with tall stature are at the highest risk of imbalance/falling. The number of imbalanced postures due to deficits in the calf and hamstring muscles was reduced by 7.5 times by strengthening the whole body musculature. The calf and the hamstring muscles play a key role in balance regardless of stature.}

abstract = {Research on early childhood robotics education often focuses narrowly on teaching young children STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) concepts and skills. In this qualitative case study, our research team examined what happened when we worked with young children (age 7) and combined the technologies of robotics education with an inquiry approach, that is, an opportunity for students to collaboratively identify a problem arising from their own lived experiences and build a robot to solve it. We found that the process of children’s problem identification was dialogic, not only with peers and teachers but also with materials, as they defined and refined problems based on interactions with peers and objects. As this study was conducted at an economically disadvantaged public school in the Southern United States, we argue that early childhood robotics education has a great potential to engage young children in STEM learning in a personally meaningful manner and that an instructional approach fostering children’s inquiry and project-based learning through their problem finding and problem posing is effective in making STEM accessible to students from diverse backgrounds.}

abstract = {Drawing on struggles within academe between faculty that promote critical education and advocates of New Public Management (NPM) who endorse instrumental learning, I reimagine the university as a counter-space that positions it as a counter-power to informational capitalism. Initially, I outline its twin threats: ethical, as self-entrepreneurial academics are valorised by NPM; and political, with informationalisation conflating spaces of thinking. I then detail Scott Lash’s specific account of how the info-comm society negates critique. However, his monistic understanding of informationalisation means Lash’s alternative of Informationskritik risks subsumption by it. I therefore defer to Jacques Derrida’s idea of the university. To ensure the autonomy of the principle of reason in a world of info-comm flows, the university is a supplementary body to society, yet intimately linked to it by its critical reflexivity, which is on behalf of society. Because Derrida does not elaborate the requisite institutional architecture, I conclude with Michel Foucault’s notion of heterotopia as a quasi-illicit site that is different and other. Such an institutional design enables the university as a counter-space that is a bank of reason and an archive of its manifestation in social practices. It also upholds a space for thinking, which in the form of nominalist critical history proffers a counter-power to society as an informational homotopia.}

abstract = {Personalisation of media content is not a new phenomenon. Now, however, by configuring our search results and data feeds, algorithms that ‘learn’ from our digital footprint are determining what we see and hear. Pariser calls this the ‘Filter Bubble Effect’. Yet, despite concerns that this effect is a threat to deliberative democracy, we are told there is relatively little evidence to substantiate its existence. This article draws on a case study to argue that this is because the existing research looks for technical effects while neglecting our social lives. If we follow Foucault’s reasoning that systems of thought are also technologies, then we can see that material technologies (or what Foucault called ‘technologies of production’) and immaterial technologies (ideas formed in discourse) can co-constitute filter bubbles. Borrowing language from computing and science and technology studies, this leads to a redefinition of filter bubbles as socio-technical recursion. This case study illustrates just one potential combination of such material and immaterial technologies (namely, search engines and ideas that are encountered and formed during an individual’s social life within their culture and class) that can create socio-technical recursion. The article concludes by arguing the advantage of conceptualising filter bubbles in this way is that it offers us a theoretical foundation for breaking out of this recursion by simultaneously challenging the mediums and messages that sustain them.}

abstract = {Setting cutoff scores is one of the most common practices when using scales to aid in classification purposes. This process is usually done univariately where each optimal cutoff value is decided sequentially, subscale by subscale. While it is widely known that this process necessarily reduces the probability of “passing” such a test, what is not properly recognized is that such a test loses power to meaningfully discriminate between target groups with each new subscale that is introduced. We quantify and describe this property via an analytical exposition highlighting the counterintuitive geometry implied by marginal threshold-setting in multiple dimensions. Recommendations are presented that encourage applied researchers to think jointly, rather than marginally, when setting cutoff scores to ensure an informative test.}

We want, and need, to understand how solutions to problems are developed so that interactions with both successful and unsuccessful problem-solvers can become more effective. In order to build a more sophisticated understanding of problem-solving we must consider a number of major factors — the instructional setting, the nature of the problem-solver, the resources available, the structure of the mathematical content and the student’s understanding of that, and the processes used in the solution. Also needed is a technique for identifying those processes in samples of students’ mathematics performance. What we learn from using the technique influences the design of future instruction.}

This article addresses language demands and opportunities that are embedded in the science and engineering practices delineated in the Framework. By examining intersections between learning of science and learning of language, the article identifies key features of the language of the science classroom as students engage in these language-intensive science and engineering practices. We propose that when students, especially English language learners, are adequately supported to “do” specific things with language, both science learning and language learning are promoted. We highlight implications for Common Core State Standards for English language arts and mathematics.}

abstract = {Background The use of game-based learning strategies in higher education has shown promise to increase student motivation and achievement. Although studies have begun to explore the structuring of courses as a game, little is known on who benefits the most from this type of instructional environment. Aim This research study explored the impact of a large lecture course designed with game-based learning on participation and achievement. Game elements included narrative, quests, points, feedback, and badges. Method 71 undergraduate students participated in a case study utilizing a mixed methods approach. Measures included course achievement, course participation, and a survey on beliefs and practices. Results Findings indicated students in a large course structured with game-based learning maintained high participation and persistence in meeting course requirements. In addition, overall achievement was not significantly correlated with age, gender, learning style, or game use, contradicting the research literature on game-based learning. Conclusions The use of game-based learning is beneficial for engaging all students in large lecture courses, but more work is needed in determining which strategies are most effective for learning.}

abstract = {This paper investigates the effects of clustering on the effective transverse thermal conductivity of unidirectional cement composites filled with natural hemp fibers. A typical clustering pattern with four hemp fibers embedded into cement matrix is designed as the representative two-dimensional unit cell, which is taken from the periodic cement composite under consideration, and a clustering degree parameter is introduced to adjust the distance between clustered fibers. For this heterogeneous two-component composite model, distributions of the heat flux component are obtained using finite element simulation for various clustering cases involving different global fiber volume concentrations, clustering degree parameters, and thermal conductivity of both fiber and matrix, to evaluate the effective thermal conductivity of the composite. To further reveal the effects caused by clustered fibers, a random cluster pattern of hemp fibers in the unit cell is considered for comparison with the present regular clustering pattern. Further, a simple theoretical model with specified flexible factor f is developed by matching the theoretical and numerical predictions.}
