abstract = {Background Maxillary antrostomy is commonly performed during endoscopic sinus surgery. Little is known about the association surrounding recalcitrant maxillary sinusitis, antrostomy size, and intranasal airflow changes. Furthermore, the interaction between sinus mucosa and airflow is poorly understood. This study used computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to investigate postoperative airflow characteristics between diseased and nondiseased maxillary sinuses in subjects with recurrent disease. Methods A retrospective review of patients from a tertiary-level academic rhinology practice was performed. Seven subjects with endoscopic evidence of postoperative maxillary sinus disease that presented as chronic unilateral crusting at least 1 year after bilateral maxillary antrostomies were selected. A three-dimensional model of each subject’s sinonasal cavity was created from postoperative computed tomographies and used for CFD analysis. Results Although the variables investigated between diseased and nondiseased sides were not statistically significant, the diseased side in six subjects had a smaller antrostomy, and five of these subjects had both reduced nasal unilateral airflow and increased unilateral nasal resistance on the diseased side. The ratio of posterior wall shear stress (WSS) of the maxillary sinus to the total WSS was higher on the diseased side in six subjects. Results also showed strong correlations between antrostomy and CFD variables on the diseased side than on the nondiseased side. Conclusion This pilot study showed that the majority of the simulated sinonasal models exhibited common characteristics on the side with persistent disease, such as smaller antrostomy, reduced nasal airflow, increased nasal resistance, and increased posterior WSS. Although statistical significance was not established, this study provided preliminary insight into variables to consider in a larger cohort study.}

abstract = {Hydraulic conductivity (k) is critical for designing permeable pavements for safety and environmental reasons. A novel approach for estimating k is through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) applied to permeable asphalt (PA). Specimens of PA are examined in this study to evaluate CFD applicability. Tortuosity, effective porosity, pore size distribution, and specific surface area were determined based on three-dimensional specimen structures reconstructed using x-ray tomography analyses. Using CFD, estimates of k were determined and compared with physical measurements and also with the results obtained from the semi-empirical modified Kozeny-Carman model (KCM). The comparison shows that the numerical simulations with CFD can be a reasonable tool for estimating k and for examining transport of water through PA. Within the constraints of this study, results infer that CFD can provide more representative results for low k in comparison with KCM. For higher k, CFD and KCM results were reasonably comparable.}

abstract = {Advancements in robotic technology are making it increasingly possible to integrate robots into the human workspace in order to improve productivity and decrease worker strain resulting from the performance of repetitive, arduous physical tasks. While new computational methods have significantly enhanced the ability of people and robots to work flexibly together, there has been little study of the ways in which human factors influence the design of these computational techniques. In particular, collaboration with robots presents unique challenges related to the preservation of human situational awareness and the optimization of workload allocation for human teammates while respecting their workflow preferences. We conducted a series of human subject experiments to investigate these human factors, and provide design guidelines for the development of intelligent collaborative robots based on our results.}

It provides a computational theory for integrating recent findings on emotion and cultural sensitivities into an interactive drama played by interacting characters with varying personalities. The FAtiMA-PSI, the implementation of their theory, has advanced a critical step towards basing affective intelligence on a firmer ground. Future challenges include building an empathic agent on the simulated physiology level that can be recognized as an independent ego with its own personality and presence.}

abstract = {This article proposes a Rayleigh’s quotient–based damage detection algorithm. It aims at efficiently revealing nascent structural changes on a given structure with the capability to differentiate between an actual damage and a change in operational conditions. The first three damage detection levels are targeted: existence, location, and severity. The proposed algorithm is analytically developed from the dynamics theory and the virtual energy principle. Some computational techniques are proposed for carrying out computations, including discretization, integration, derivation, and suitable optimization methods. Field implementation strategies are also considered for the purpose of online damage monitoring. In order to prove the efficiency of this strategy, one experimental and three numerical case studies were conducted. The proposed algorithm successfully detected the damage in all simulated cases and estimated the damage severity with acceptable accuracy. The conclusion is that the proposed algorithm was able to efficiently detect damage appearance in a range of structures for various damage levels and locations, and under different operational conditions.}

abstract = {This paper details the development of a generalized computational approach that enables prediction of cavity-internal sound pressure distribution due to flow-generated noise at high frequencies. The outcomes of this research is of particular interest for development of an acoustics-based structural health monitoring system for wind turbine blades. The methodology builds from existing reduced-order aeroacoustic modeling techniques and ray tracing based geometrical acoustics and is demonstrated on the model NREL 5 MW wind turbine blade as a case study. The computational predictions demonstrated that damage could be successfully detected in the first half of the blade cavity near the root and that the change in frequency content may be indicative of the type of damage that has occurred. This study provides a foundation to analyze specific blades and likely damage cases for determining key factors of system design such as number and placement of sensors as well as for hardware selection.}

abstract = {Empirical studies of face recognition suggest that faces might be stored in memory by means of a few canonical representations. The nature of these canonical representations is, however, unclear. Although psychological data show a three-quarter-view advantage, physiological studies suggest profile and frontal views are stored in memory. A computational approach to reconcile these findings is proposed. The pattern of results obtained when different views, or combinations of views, are used as the internal representation of a two-stage identification network consisting of an autoassociative memory followed by a radial-basis-function network are compared. Results show that (i) a frontal and a profile view are sufficient to reach the optimal network performance; and (ii) all the different representations produce a three-quarter view advantage, similar to that generally described for human subjects. These results indicate that although three-quarter views yield better recognition than other views, they need not be stored in memory to show this advantage.}

abstract = {The purpose of this article is to optimize the design of a pickup head that removes particles from road surface. A validated computational fluid dynamics model was proposed to evaluate the particle removal performance of the designed pickup head with different inclination angles. The gas-particle flow through the pickup head was modelled using the EulerianLagrangian approach. The realizable k model and the discrete particle model were adopted to simulate gas flow field and solid particle trajectories, respectively. The results indicate that the inclination angle of the rear edge wall and the pressure drop across the pickup head have great impact on the particle removal performance. Both the particle overall removal efficiency and the grade efficiency increase with the increment of inclination angle, and higher pressure drop can pick up more particles from the road surface, but it would induce unnecessary energy consumption. Therefore, it is necessary to design a pickup head with high removal efficiency and low pressure drop. Through simulation, the optimal angle should be 135 for the range of the inclination angle in this study, and pressure drop is about 2400Pa. Furthermore, more information can be acquired for pickup head design.}

abstract = {This paper presents a computationally efficient Bayesian inference framework and its application to infer damage in truss bridges. The novelty of the proposed framework for reducing the computational burden of Bayesian inference of structural damage lies in (a) the revised transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for efficiently drawing statistical samples of damage indexes and (b) the likelihood function in the frequency domain based on modal properties that could be derived from the stochastic subspace identification. Other special features of the proposed framework include (a) explicitly modeling complexities of truss joints for allowing identification of truss joint damage and the assessment of its associated uncertainties and (b) incorporating the structural finite element model into the probabilistic inference computational environment through the program application interface. Those improvements make new contributions to the field of damage identification for truss bridges, leading to the practical application of Bayesian inference of the large amounts of potential damage not only in truss members but also in truss joints. The applicability and efficiency of the proposed framework are illustrated and examined by using numerical simulation of a damaged prototype truss structure. Simulation results indicate that the proposed approach has the potential capacity for determining the extent and location of large amounts of truss damage and the probabilistic characteristics. Finally, the limitation of this study and the future research need for practical application of the proposed probabilistic framework are discussed.}
