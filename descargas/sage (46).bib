N2 - The social identity approach suggests that group prototypical individuals have greater influence over fellow group members. This effect has been well-studied offline. Here, we use a novel method of assessing prototypicality in naturally occurring data to test whether this effect can be replicated in online communities. In Study 1a (N = 53,049 Reddit users), we train a linguistic measure of prototypicality for two social groups: libertarians and entrepreneurs. We then validate this measure further to ensure it is not driven by demographics (Study 1b: N = 882) or local accommodation (Study 1c: N = 1,684 Silk Road users). In Study 2 (N = 8,259), we correlate this measure of prototypicality with social network indicators of social influence. In line with the social identity approach, individuals who are more prototypical generate more responses from others. Implications for testing sociopsychological theories with naturally occurring data using computational approaches are discussed.

N2 - A robust approach to computational kinematics intended to cope with algorithmic singularities is introduced in this article. The approach is based on the reduction of the original system of equations to a subsystem of bivariate equations, as opposed to the multivariate polynomial reduction leading to the characteristic univariate polynomial. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated for the exact function-generation synthesis of planar, spherical, and spatial four-bar linkages. Some numerical examples are provided for the case of the spherical four-bar function generator with six precision points to show the benefits of the proposed method with respect to methods reported in the literature.

N2 - Stainless steel alloys are widely used in many important applications but their production presents difficulties because they contain expensive chromium, which can be extensively oxidised during decarburisation to the very low carbon levels required. Modern stainless steelmaking largely avoids this problem by having two distinct stages and is therefore described as duplex practice. Molten high carbon stainless steel is produced in an electric arc furnace and then the melt is decarburised in an argon–oxygen converter or a vacuum oxygen decarburising converter. In this work, computational thermodynamics has been used to examine the major reactions occurring in the electric arc furnace and to show the effect of various process variables on chromium recovery. It was shown that significant oxidation of the scrap must occur during melting, and that subsequent carbon/oxygen injection initially oxidises some chromium, but then mostly oxidises the added carbon. Chromium was predicted to exist in the slag as CrO and CrO1·5 in almost equal proportions. Increasing the temperature should improve chromium recovery but results in less benefit than expected due to the decreasing activity coefficients of CrO and CrO1·5 and the increasing oxygen partial pressure. Ferrosilicon additions reduce chromium oxides from the slag, but much of the silicon simply dissolves into the steel. Computational thermodynamics is seen to be a very effective educational tool for gaining an understanding of smelting processes.

N2 - This study implemented and evaluated the innovative use of a performance-based assessment platform to support the development of self-regulated learning (SRL) in senior primary students as they completed programming tasks. We embedded SRL support features into a performance-based assessment platform as scaffolding to help the students implement problem-solving strategies. A mixed-methods approach was adopted to evaluate the intervention. The students’ perceptions of their SRL skills after working through the programming tasks were measured by a survey of 45 students. The quantitative results suggested that the students benefited from the performance-based assessment platform in developing their SRL skills. A thematic analysis of interview data from 20 students further indicated that the embedded SRL scaffolding and automatic marking function helped them to solve the programming tasks. The results demonstrate that a well-designed performance-based assessment platform with embedded SRL support can be an effective tool for developing students’ SRL. The qualitative results further revealed that algorithmic thinking is an aspect of programming for which students need more SRL support.

N2 - We developed a novel concept of endovascular thrombolysis that employs a vibrating electroactive polymer actuator. In order to predict the efficacy of thrombolysis using the developed vibrating actuator, enzyme (plasminogen activator) perfusion into a clot was analyzed by solving flow fields and species transport equations considering the fluid structure interaction. In vitro thrombolysis experiments were also performed. Computational results showed that plasminogen activator perfusion into a clot was enhanced by actuator vibration at frequencies of 1 and 5 Hz. Plasminogen activator perfusion was affected by the actuator oscillation frequencies and amplitudes that were determined by electromechanical characteristics of a polymer actuator. Computed plasminogen activator perfused volumes were compared with experimentally measured dissolved clot volumes. The computed plasminogen activator perfusion volumes with threshold concentrations of 16% of the initial plasminogen activator concentration agreed well with the in vitro experimental data. This study showed the effectiveness of actuator oscillation on thrombolysis and the validity of the computational plasminogen activator perfusion model for predicting thrombolysis in complex flow fields induced by an oscillating actuator.

N2 - Abstract Experimental data from internal combustion (IC) engines suggests that the use of proprietary computational fluid dynamics (CFD) codes for the prediction of coolant-side heat transfer within IC engine coolant jackets often results in underprediction of the convective heat transfer coefficient. An experimental and computational study, based on a coolant gallery simulator rig designed specifically to reproduce realistic IC engine operating conditions, has been conducted to explore this issue. It is shown that the standard ‘wall function’ approach normally used in CFD models to model near-wall conditions does not adequately represent some features of the flow that are relevant in convective heat transfer. Alternative modelling approaches are explored to account for these shortcomings and an empirical approach is shown to be successful; however, the methodology is not easily transferable to other situations.

N2 - Several flow visualization techniques using the Lagran gian approach are proposed for analyzing the numerical solutions of unsteady flow fields computed by the Eu lerian approach. We show how these methods can be used to assess the validity of solutions and to extract the nature of the flow fields. The numerical algorithms for the flow solver and the flow visualization are introduced. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are solved using the extended MAC method and the compressible Euler equations are solved using the TVD MacCormack method. Most of the flow visualization methods are conventional. For vector fields, however, we introduce a particle tracing algorithm that is suitable for large amounts of numerical data. We present four flow visu alizations using these methods: flow past a circular cyl inder in two dimensions, shock wave propagation over a circular cylinder, flow past a sphere, and flow around an entire automobile.

N2 - Theories are the core of any science, but many imprecisely stated theories in organizational and management science are hampering progress in the field. Computational modeling of existing theories can help address the issue. Computational models are a type of formal theory that are represented mathematically or by other formal logic and can be simulated, allowing theorists to assess whether the theory can explain the phenomena intended as well as make testable predictions. As an example of the process, Locke’s integrated model of work motivation is translated into static and dynamic computational models. Simulations of these models are compared to the empirical data used to develop and test the theory. For the static model, the simulations revealed largely strong associations with robust empirical findings. However, adding dynamics created several challenges to key precepts of the theory. Moreover, the effort revealed where empirical work is needed to further refine or refute the theory. Discussion focuses on the value of computational modeling as a method for formally testing, pruning, and extending extant theories in the field.

N2 - In this study, three-dimensional computational fluid dynamics simulation was adopted to evaluate the valve-induced water hammer phenomena in a typical tank-pipeline-valve-tank system. Meanwhile, one-dimensional analysis based on method of characteristics was also used for comparison and reference. As for the computational fluid dynamics model, the water hammer event was successfully simulated by using the sliding mesh technology and considering water compressibility. The key factors affecting simulation results were investigated in detail. It is found that the size of time step has an obvious effect on the attenuation of the wave and there exists a best time step. The obtained simulation results have a good agreement with the experimental data, which shows an unquestionable advantage over the method of characteristics calculation in predicting valve-induced water hammer. In addition, the computational fluid dynamics simulation can also provide a visualization of the pressure and flow evolutions during the transient process.

N2 - Model uncertainty is pervasive in social science. A key question is how robust empirical results are to sensible changes in model specification. We present a new approach and applied statistical software for computational multimodel analysis. Our approach proceeds in two steps: First, we estimate the modeling distribution of estimates across all combinations of possible controls as well as specified functional form issues, variable definitions, standard error calculations, and estimation commands. This allows analysts to present their core, preferred estimate in the context of a distribution of plausible estimates. Second, we develop a model influence analysis showing how each model ingredient affects the coefficient of interest. This shows which model assumptions, if any, are critical to obtaining an empirical result. We demonstrate the architecture and interpretation of multimodel analysis using data on the union wage premium, gender dynamics in mortgage lending, and tax flight migration among U.S. states. These illustrate how initial results can be strongly robust to alternative model specifications or remarkably dependent on a knife-edge specification.
