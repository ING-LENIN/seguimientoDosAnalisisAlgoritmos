abstract = {The contemporary prevalence of artificial intelligence and machine learning methods has resulted in a rich literature on the factors that shape computational research. This article draws on the laboratory studies literature to examine how platforms’ socio-technical infrastructures shape contemporary computational social science research. Based on 18 months of online ethnography of a university laboratory and 15 in-depth interviews with its researchers, the article makes two main arguments. First, for computational social sciences, platforms function as laboratories where the social is selectively carved and transformed, to make it knowable with computational methods. Thus, it makes the case that platforms manufacture the objects of analysis in computational social research and provide the social as a domain. Second, because of the significance of social media platforms as data laboratories for computational research, in contrast to the claims of data sciences to be domainless, these sciences may derive some of their epistemological and occupational power, as well as their cultural authority, from digital capitalism.}

abstract = {People make subjective judgments about the healthiness of different foods every day, and these judgments in turn influence their food choices and health outcomes. Despite the importance of such judgments, there are few quantitative theories about their psychological underpinnings. This article introduces a novel computational approach that can approximate people’s knowledge representations for thousands of common foods. We used these representations to predict how both lay decision-makers (the general population) and experts judge the healthiness of individual foods. We also applied our method to predict the impact of behavioral interventions, such as the provision of front-of-pack nutrient and calorie information. Across multiple studies with data from 846 adults, our models achieved very high accuracy rates (r2 = .65–.77) and significantly outperformed competing models based on factual nutritional content. These results illustrate how new computational methods applied to established psychological theory can be used to better predict, understand, and influence health behavior.}

abstract = {The pervasive role of computers in finance is strongly affecting the way investors operate on the stock market. In the last few years there has been a strong focus on short-time transactions that is the subject of many studies in the emerging field of computational finance. In this survey, we discuss the nature of the problem and give an overview of the most significant results. The critical analysis given in the paper covers classic time series predictions techniques, with emphasis on methods widely used in AI, as well as more recent attempts to make predictions on the basis of textual information extracted from financial portals and other relevant on-line sources. We claim that most results in the literature are not based on systematic evaluation over long time intervals and that, at the same time, vague declarations on the supposed efficiency of the market are not motivated.}

abstract = {What is algorithmic thought? It is not possible to address this question without first reflecting on how the Universal Turing Machine transformed symbolic logic and brought to a halt the universality of mathematical formalism and the biocentric speciation of thought. The article draws on Sylvia Wynter’s discussion of the sociogenic principle to argue that both neurocognitive and formal models of automated cognition constitute the epistemological explanations of the origin of the human and of human sapience. Wynter’s argument will be related to Gilbert Simondon’s reflections on ‘technical mentality’ to consider how socio-techno-genic assemblages can challenge the biocentricism and the formalism of modern epistemology. This article turns to ludic logic as one possible example of techno-semiotic languages as a speculative overturning of sociogenic programming. Algorithmic rules become technique-signs coinciding not with classic formalism but with interactive localities without re-originating the universality of colonial and patriarchal cosmogony.}

abstract = {Previous research has shown the effectiveness of peer reviewing on the improvement of writing quality. However, the fact that students themselves, arguably novices, judged the improvement leads to concerns about the validity of peer reviewing. We measured writing quality before and after peer reviewing using Coh-Metrix, which computationally evaluates the linguistic properties of writings. Participants also evaluated the quality of their peer writings using the SWoRD system. Both measurements, particularly the computational measurement, confirmed the effectiveness of peer reviewing. In addition, the computational measures found that awareness of cohesion, including the clarity, explicitness, and concreteness of writing, improved over the course of peer reviewing. The results are discussed, along with their possible implications for the complementary roles of peer reviewing and computational writing measurements.}

abstract = {We review recent evidence revealing that the mere willingness to engage analytic reasoning as a means to override intuitive gut feelings is a meaningful predictor of key psychological outcomes in diverse areas of everyday life. For example, those with a more analytic thinking style are more skeptical about religious, paranormal, and conspiratorial concepts. In addition, analytic thinking relates to having less traditional moral values, making less emotional or disgust-based moral judgments, and being less cooperative and more rationally self-interested in social dilemmas. Analytic thinkers are even less likely to offload thinking to smartphone technology and may be more creative. Taken together, these results indicate that the propensity to think analytically has major consequences for individual psychology.}

abstract = {The subject of nanofriction having its origins in the late 19th century has slowly but surely started picking up lately. With rapid advancements in science and technology throughout the last century, understanding nanofriction has been gaining prominence. In this context, and in the current 21st century of nanotechnology, it is expected that nanofriction will play a predominant role, as we try moving forward to solve the most pressing medical and biological problems with the usage of nanobots. It is important to understand the challenges we have to encounter in order to solve these problems for the benefit of the human race. The availability of high speed computers and smart algorithms has made it possible to investigate the problems (as outlined above and many more) without compromising on the complexities involved. The focus of the present review is to bring together major theoretical/mathematical models and computational approaches to study friction at nanoscale. The role of adhesion in the estimation of force of friction at nanoscale has also been clearly outlined. A critical discussion on the significance of single and multiple asperity models towards estimating friction at nanoscale has also been provided. At the end, a short description on scanning probe microscopy in estimating nanofriction has been provided for the completeness of the review.}
