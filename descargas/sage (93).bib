abstract = {Experts seem to find routes in complex environments by finding a connection from the source to a “skeleton” of major paths, then moving within the skeleton to the neighborhood of the destination, making a final connection to the destination. The authors present a computational hypothesis that describes the skeleton as emerging from the interaction of three factors: (a) The topological map is represented as a bipartite graph of places and paths, where a path is a one-dimensional ordered set of places; (b) a traveler incrementally accumulates topological relationships, including the relation of a place to a path serving as a dividing boundary separating two regions; and (c) the wayfinding algorithm prefers paths rich in boundary relations so they are likely to acquire more boundary relations. This positive-feedback loop leads to an oligarchy of paths rich in boundary relations. The authors present preliminary computational and empirical tests for this hypothesis, and provide initial results.}

abstract = {We consider a system of coupled partial differential equations describing transient fluid flow and heat transfer with variable flow properties. Classical Lie point symmetry analysis of this system resulted in admitted large Lie algebras for some special cases of the arbitrary constants and the source term. Symmetry reductions are performed and as such the system of partial differential equations is reduced to the system of ordinary differential equations. Some reduced ordinary differential equation could be solved exactly with restrictions on the parameters appearing in it. In addition, shooting quadrature is employed to numerically tackle the nonlinear model boundary value problem and pertinent results are presented graphically and discussed quantitatively.}

abstract = {In order to assist the designer in the design process, it is necessary to develop a new intelligent computational methodology that involves the integration of design, analysis and evaluation, and optimisation. In this paper, a hybrid cross-mapping neural network model (HCMNN) is proposed to support design, analysis and evaluation, and optimisation in the design process, which integrates a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and a Hopfield neural network (HNN). The BPNN is used for representing design patterns, training classification boundaries, and outputting the net weight values to the HNN, and then the HNN uses the calculated weight values to evaluate and modify or redesign the design patterns. The developed system provides a unified computational intelligent design framework. The system has self-modifying or self-learning functions. Within the system, only one network is needed to train for accomplishing design analysis and evaluation, rectification/modification and optimisation tasks in the design process. Finally, two case studies are provided to verify the proposed model.}

abstract = {Heat transfer is a significant factor affecting internal combustion engine efficiency, emissions and performance. This study concentrates on model development for convective heat transfer and near-wall turbulent flow. The solution of complete fluid dynamics equations within the very thin-wall boundary layers is, and will be in the near future, very impractical in engineering scale flows with any present day method. An advanced numerical near-wall treatment method within the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes framework has been developed. The method solves simplified boundary layer equations for enthalpy, momentum, turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation in wall adjacent cells on cellwise high-resolution subgrids, adaptive to local conditions. The boundary layer equations include temperature gradient–induced density/multicomponent material property variations and complete imbalance contributions, for example, convection, transients, pressure gradient and external sources, in compact forms. The resulting numerical wall functions are valid with near-wall grid resolution ranging from the viscous sublayer to the fully turbulent region, thus avoiding the conflicting near wall resolution requirements of common low–Reynolds and high–Reynolds number turbulence models. The advanced near wall treatment method, comprising the numerical imbalance wall functions and accordingly modified low–Reynolds number turbulence model, is implemented in STAR-CD 4.12, extensively utilized in engine simulations. The near wall treatment method is validated against available measurements and direct numerical simulation data of strongly heated pipe flow. Performance of the near-wall treatment method in engine conjugate heat transfer simulations is also demonstrated. Local and average effects of variable properties and imbalance contributions on piston surface heat transfer, friction and turbulent sources are elaborated and contrasted to the standard high–Reynolds number near-wall treatment.}

abstract = {Background literature review, methodology, results, and analysis are presented for a novel approach to approximating wind pressure on tall buildings for the application of generative design exploration and optimisation. The predictions are approximations of time-averaged computational fluid dynamics (CFD) data with the aim of maintaining simulation accuracy but with improved speed. This is achieved through the use of a back-propagation artificial neural network (ANN) with vertex-based shape features as input and pressure as output. The training set consists of 600 procedurally generated tall building models, and the test set of 10 real building models; for all models in both sets, a feature vector is calculated for every vertex. Over the test set, mean absolute errors against the basis CFD are 1.99–4.44% (σ:2. 10–5.09%) with an on-line process time of 14.72–809.98s (0.028s/sample). Studies are also included on feature sensitivity, training set size, and comparison of CFD against prediction times. Results indicate that prediction time is only dependent on the number of test model vertices, and is therefore invariant to basis CFD time.}
