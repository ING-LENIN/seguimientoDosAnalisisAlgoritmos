abstract = {In architectural design, a well-structured and adaptable approach is fundamental to creating functional and cohesive spaces, providing a foundational framework for spatial organization. As design requirements grow increasingly complex, traditional methods often fall short of addressing multifaceted design needs, such as user preferences, environmental considerations, and geometric constraints. Computational design techniques offer advanced methods to automate and refine architectural space planning. Despite significant advancements in computational software and data processing capabilities, challenges remain in practically embedding diverse design criteria. This study systematically reviews computational methods for architectural spatial design from 2013 to 2023, analyzing methodologies, typological applications, user preferences, and advancements in environmental data integration. The findings highlight a shift from rule-based to data-driven approaches, emphasizing the development of scalable and intuitive tools. This research identifies pathways for adopting computational design in architectural practice and education, underlining the critical role of user-centered adaptability and environmental responsiveness in shaping future tools.}

As past studies showed mixed results, our random effects meta-analysis of 21 effect sizes from 17 studies of 1256 participants determined the overall effect of AR on HOT and accounted for differences across studies via moderator effects. AR had a large positive overall effect on HOT (g = 1.109, 95% CI [0.699, 1.518]) but differed significantly across studies. AR effects on HOT were (a) largest for 3D visualization (g = 1.216), with progressively smaller ones for immersion (g = 1.198), collaboration (g = 0.934) and contextualization (g = 0.408), (b) larger for skills (g = 1.243) than disposition (g = 0.371), and (c) larger for convergent HOT (g = 1.625) than divergent HOT (g = 0.395).}

abstract = {This commentary lays out a framework for building on early critical cartographic and critical geographic information system work to develop a critical approach for the computational future of geographical thought and praxis. Computation – as a highly representational and structural form which combines speech and action – is a very particular way of building worlds. As computation becomes more prevalent in critiques of deep fakes, GeoAI, and platform geographies, geographers have also developed the foundations for a critical computational approach with an explicitly spatial or geographical focus that combines both theory and practice. Yet, while many of the technological affordances of spatial computation are relatively novel, the critiques raised by social, political, economic, and cultural geographers shadow debates that emerged two decades ago between cartographers and geospatial scientists about the power and praxis of mapping as it becomes translated into a digital era.

abstract = {Unlike other technologies that augment human physical skills and abilities, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies interact with human thinking skills nurtured through various educational processes. Hence, advances in these technologies challenge the education sector to reimagine the suitable intellectual formation of students in the AI age. It is observed that as soon as AI tools acquire certain cognitive skills, humans tend to delegate those skills to such tools, risking redundancy in their personal and professional lives. Therefore, anticipating an ever-increasing involvement of AI tools in various cognitive processes, educational systems must equip students with both AI-collaborative and AI-complementary thinking skills, making them resilient to the advancements of AI technologies. Furthermore, it demands that educators continually redefine the spectrum of thinking skills required for and imparted to students in the AI age. This article aims to develop a comprehensive taxonomy of educational objectives for AI-natives by reimagining thinking skills relevant in the AI age. It is intended to help educational policymakers worldwide reimagine the appropriate set of thinking skills relevant for students in the AI age. Additionally, the article provides important insights to restructure contemporary educational practices to meet the requirements of the holistic formation of the AI-natives.}

abstract = {While a small number of school districts across the United States are well into the process of implementing system-wide computer science education (CSed), most districts are only just getting started. But what does it look like to “get started” on CSed for a whole district? This manuscript presents a single case study of a district’s process of initiating their CS instructional initiative, highlighting a distinct set of instructional leadership practices and the institutional conditions they were responding to. Early implementation research around CSed shows that in some districts, leadership practices are less often the focus of early activities. This study sheds light on what such leadership practices can look like in the early stages of a district’s CSed initiative. Our analysis, based on qualitative data collected longitudinally over 18 months of the district’s work, identified eight intertwined leadership practices that aimed to support instructional coherence, and in our findings, we share a narrative of the district’s initiation of its CS initiative around them. The case begins with the (1) initial leadership team formation and details how that team engaged in (2) content-specific instructional capacity building for its members and (3) sensemaking of ideas around CS with their relationship to existing district activities. It moves on to the team’s (4) development of an instructional vision and an (5) associated implementation strategy, which fed into processes of (6) sensegiving to foster buy-in among teachers, and providing encouragement to engage in (7) instructional piloting. Finally, leaders engaged in (8) landscape analysis activities in order to understand existing district resources and teacher perceptions related to CS. Throughout the case, we highlight the motivations behind these practices, what resources they drew on, intersections, and dependencies among them. We close our analysis exploring a number of tensions and unintended consequences associated with these leadership activities.}
