N2 - Within the context of the growing polarisation and fragmentation of the urban landscape, this paper presents a computational typology applicable to the study of minority communities, both ethnic and religious, which is useful in understanding their spatial distribution and juxtaposition at neighbourhood levels. The typology has been applied to multicultural London with the use of the 2001 Census, in which there were questions on ethnicity and religion. The landscape of religion is found to be more highly segregated in contrast to the landscape of ethnicity. Furthermore, on the basis of a preliminary analysis of indicator variables, minorities seem on aggregate to be in an improved situation given a level of residential segregation, with the exception of residents of segregated Asian-Bangladeshi areas for ethnicity and residents of segregated Muslim areas for religion. This questions the generally held view that segregation in a multicultural society is undesirable per se and suggests that a ‘one size fits all’ government policy towards residential segregation is insufficiently perceptive. The typology introduced here should facilitate a more critically informed approach to multiculturalism and the contemporary city.

N2 - A number of toxic effects are brought about by the covalent interaction between the toxicant and biological macromolecules. In chemico assays are available that attempt to identify reactive compounds. These approaches have been developed independently for pharmaceuticals and for other non-pharmaceutical compounds. The assays vary widely in terms of the macromolecule (typically a peptide) and the analytical technique utilised. For both sets of methods, there are great opportunities to capture in chemico information by using in silico methods to provide computational tools for screening purposes. In order to use these in chemico and in silico methods, integrated testing strategies are required for individual toxicity endpoints. The potential for the use of these approaches is described, and a number of recommendations to improve this extremely useful technique, in terms of implementing the Three Rs in toxicity testing, are presented.

N2 - In this article, a typical submersible well pump was investigated to study the effects of inter-stage leakage on the inner flow field and external characteristics. The whole flow field of the model pump with different seal clearances was simulated by computational fluid dynamics software. The inter-stage clearance leakage calculated by numerical simulation was compared with the values obtained by the empirical formula. The pressure values were recorded with the arrangement of monitor points in the inter-stage clearance, inlet region, and outlet region, which aimed to study the effects of the change of inter-stage clearance pressure on the pump performance. Meanwhile, a comparative analysis of numerical simulation and performance test of the pump was conducted further. The results showed that the leakage at the small clearance is close to the value calculated using empirical formula. But when the clearance is large, the discrepancy between the simulation result and empirical value inclines. Comparing the numerical results of three kinds of clearance leakage, we found that the clearance leakage could not be ignored in the simulation since it has a large effect on the prediction of pump efficiency and head.

N2 - Calcium silicate hydrate Jennite is a molecular structure commonly accepted as a representation of the complex calcium silicate hydrate gel formed during the hydration of typical Portland cement. In this paper, the behavior of nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite under shear deformation was investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Computational samples representing the nanoscale structure of calcium silicate hydrate Jennite were subjected to shear deformation in order to investigate not only their mechanical properties but also their deformation behavior. The simulation results indicated that the nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite under shear deformation displays a linear elastic behavior up to shear stress of approximately 1.0 GPa, and shear deformation of about 0.08 radians, after which point yielding and plastic deformation occurs. The shear modulus determined from the simulations was 11.2 ± 0.7 GPa. The deformation-induced displacements in molecular structures were analyzed dividing the system in regions representing calcium oxide layers. The displacement/deformation of the layers of calcium oxide forming the structure of nanoscale calcium silicate hydrate Jennite was analyzed. The non-linear stress–strain behavior in the molecular structure was attributed to a non-linear increase in the displacement due to sliding of the calcium oxide layers on top of each other with higher shearing. These results support the idea that by controlling the chemical reactions, the tailored morphologies can be used to increase the interlinking between the calcium oxide layers, thus minimizing the shearing of the layers and leading to molecular structures that can withstand larger deformation and have improved failure behavior.

N2 - Computational fluid dynamics has a wide range of application in the study of room air distribution. The application is providing valuable guidance for those interested in such areas as comfort, productivity and sick building syndrome. This paper gives a comparative review of some of the work undertaken in the field and highlights some of the modelling assumptions noted within the literature. It is apparent from the review that the use of the CFD methodology is helping to develop our understanding of internal ventilation flows, yet it is also apparent that many investigations are currently employing modelling assumptions that will hinder the development of generic guidance from such investigations.

N2 - In the present work, effects of nozzle hole size and rail pressure under non-evaporating spray condition are demonstrated. Three single hole injectors with the bore size of 0.101, 0.122, and 0.133 mm are experimented with injection pressures of 140, 45, and 38 MPa respectively to achieve similar injection rate profile. Diesel spray experiments implement Diffused Backlight Illumination Technique where diffused background is obtained for the High Speed Video camera imaging. Experimental results are then validated with computational and analytical studies. The CFD simulation requires the injection rate profile and spray cone angle as a primary input; thus, based on the High Speed Video Camera start of injection frame the 5 kHz Butterworth low-pass frequency filter is applied to the injection rate raw data. While, the spray cone angle is predicted using a simple model obtained from the relationship between the injection velocity, fluctuating velocity at the nozzle exit and total pressure loss factor of the injector. The experimental spray tip penetration of all three injectors is almost identical as the similar injection rate profile is adopted. Although, the mixture characteristics are better for 0.101 mm hole diameter since the smaller hole diameter with highest injection pressure depicts larger spray angle and better atomization. The computational study agrees with experiments qualitatively; however, the quantitative and qualitative agreements are seen in the analytical study.

N2 - The wing of an unmanned aerial vehicle, RQ-7 Shadow, is modified to study the changes in the aerodynamics of the wing. The main focus is to investigate the effects of changing the components of wing design when the aircraft climbs and accelerates. These component modifications included changing the airfoil, planform, aspect ratio, and adding a winglet. Another objective is to study the efficacy of employing high-lift airfoils like the EPPLER 559 for subsonic unmanned aerial vehicle applications. For this, five wing designs are considered in this paper. Computational fluid dynamics simulations using ANSYS FLUENT® are conducted for each wing design. The CL/CD ratios for all the wings are calculated at increasing angles of attack (simulating Climbing) and increasing speed (simulating Acceleration). Compared to the NACA 4415 airfoil, which is utilized by the RQ-7 Shadow, the EPPLER 559 provides an increase in lift at the low angles of attack, but yields less of these benefits as the angle of attack increases. The tapered planform significantly reduces the high drag associated with the EPPLER 559 airfoil. The generation of higher lift forces with lower drag is further achieved by increasing the aspect ratio and through the addition of a winglet. When compared to the NACA 4415 airfoil, it is concluded that the EPPLER 559 airfoil is a viable candidate for subsonic unmanned aerial vehicle applications only when the components of wing design are altered. The performance of the wings that employ the EPPLER 559 airfoil improves when the planform is changed from rectangular to tapered, when the aspect ratio is increased and when a winglet is added.
