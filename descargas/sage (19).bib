abstract = {This article provides an overview of computer software and instructional strategies intended to engage young people in making computer games, to achieve a variety of educational goals. It briefly describes the most popular of such programs and compares their key features, including the kinds of games that can be created with the software, the types of communities and resources that are associated with each program, claims made for learning outcomes resulting from use of the software, and the results of empirical research (if any) on the application and outcomes of the software in formal or informal educational settings. A key finding is that existing software and educational applications stress the goal of teaching users about computer programming and place little or no emphasis on teaching concepts related to game design. It concludes by discussing the potential value of explicit attention to “design thinking” as goal of game making in education.}

abstract = {Learning styles are increasingly being integrated into computational-enhanced earning environments and a great deal of recent research work is taking place in this area. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of the computational experiment approach, learning styles, epistemic beliefs, and engagement with the inquiry process on the learning performance of pre-service engineering students. The study used the Felder-Silverman learning style model (FSLSM), in order to provide information for the relation of FSLSM with the learning environment in order to examine whether the strength of learning styles has an effect on the students’ learning performance in mismatched courses. Our objective was: a) to investigate whether students with a strong preference for a specific learning style have more difficulties in learning, if their learning style is not supported in the learning environment; b) if the methodology of the computational experiment has an impact on students independently of their learning style; and c) if the epistemological beliefs are related to different learning styles. The learning environment was based on the methodology of the computational experiment and applications were developed using the Easy Java Simulator software, while the inquiry based teaching and learning process was adopted. The questionnaire responses were gathered from 79 pre-service engineering students in a higher education institute in Greece. Results indicate that students with no preferred learning style have a better learning performance in mismatched courses.}

abstract = {Background/Context: Bi/multilingual students’ STEM learning is better supported when educators leverage their language and cultural practices as resources, but STEM subject divisions have been historically constructed based on oppressive, dominant values and exclude the ways of knowing of nondominant groups. Truly promoting equity requires expanding and transforming STEM disciplines. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: This article contributes to efforts to illuminate emergent bi/multilingual students’ ways of knowing, languaging, and doing in STEM. We follow the development of syncretic literacies in relation to translanguaging practices, asking, How do knowledges and practices from different communities get combined and reorganized by students and teachers in service of new modeling practices? Setting and Participants: We focus on a seventh-grade science classroom, deliberately designed to support syncretic literacies and translanguaging practices, where computer science concepts were infused into the curriculum through modeling activities. The majority of the students in the bilingual program had arrived in the United States at most three years before enrolling, from the Caribbean and Central and South America. Research Design: We analyze one lesson that was part of a larger research–practice partnership focused on teaching computer science through leveraging translanguaging practices and syncretic literacies. The lesson was a modeling and computing activity codesigned by the teacher and two researchers about post–Hurricane María outmigration from Puerto Rico. Analysis used microethnographic methods to trace how students assembled translanguaging, social, and schooled practices to make sense of and construct models. Findings/Results: Findings show how students assembled representational forms from a variety of practices as part of accomplishing and negotiating both designed and emergent goals. These included sensemaking, constructing, explaining, justifying, and interpreting both the physical and computational models of migration. Conclusions/Recommendations: Implications support the development of theory and pedagogy that intentionally make space for students to engage in meaning-making through translanguaging and syncretic practices in order to provide new possibilities for lifting up STEM learning that may include, but is not constrained by, disciplinary learning. Additional implications for teacher education and student assessment practices call for reconceptualizing schooling beyond day-to-day curriculum as part of making an ontological shift away from prioritizing math, science, and CS disciplinary and language objectives as defined by and for schooling, and toward celebrating, supporting, and centering students’ diverse, syncretic knowledges and knowledge use.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Today’s uncertain economic and social dynamics are leading companies to seek the sort of human talent that will help them to survive and thrive. Training demands are thus arising for specific skills and competencies that would make current students and employment seekers more employable. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to identify the twenty-first century’s major employability skills and competencies as well as the main demand trends for skills and competencies. METHODS: An international panel of experts (from Spain, Thailand and Poland), from both, academic and professional business backgrounds, were asked to quantitatively project the importance of different generic and specific skills and competencies over the next five years. They were asked to do so twice, once before and once after a four-year interval (in 2016 and in 2019). Each time, they were interviewed to discuss the results. RESULTS: The most valued employability skills were of a generic nature, in all three countries. Regarding specific skills, those of a social and managerial nature were the most highly valued. Work experience and formal education became less relevant for employability. CONCLUSIONS: The study’s results can lead to recommendations on how to design a more employability-oriented curriculum in educational institutions.}

abstract = {Computational fluid dynamics is taught in many universities and is a trending elective option among engineering students. Although analyzing computational fluid dynamics simulations is exciting enough, the theory is equation intensive, sometimes very abstract and also difficult to visualize for the novice. A creative thinking based approach termed synectics, which involves analogies, was therefore applied in classroom teaching to increase student comfort with the equations. For this purpose six analogies encompassing basic computational fluid dynamics concepts were developed along with pictorial representations, and are presented in this work. These analogies were integrated into classroom teaching via synectics procedures. Student feedback was positive and reflected higher engagement with the course compared to when the metaphoric activity was not implemented. This work attempts to demonstrate the feasibility and value of applying creative techniques, even when teaching a highly structured and equation oriented course such as computational fluid dynamics.}

abstract = {Although the current landscape in education emphasizes the importance of developing students’ information literacy in formal education settings, little attention has been paid to information literacy within the context of social media use. This study investigated the relationship between information literacy and social media competence (SMC) among 1843 university students. This was done in order to increase knowledge of the components that may be important for preparing university students to be information literate citizens in social media environments. Students’ information literacy and SMC were measured by the Student Information Literacy Test and the SMC-CS scale respectively. Correlation and regression analyses were utilized to explore the relationship between university students’ information literacy and their SMC. The results showed that university students’ ability to utilize information technology to solve problems, and their sense of responsible behavior in cyberspace, are the most critical factors in predicting students’ SMC. Based on the findings, theoretical and practical implications are discussed in terms of enhancing university students’ information literacy and SMC.}
