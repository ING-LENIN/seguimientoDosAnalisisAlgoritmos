N2 - Computational design affords agency: the ability to orchestrate the material, spatial, and technical architectural system. In this specific case, it occurs through enhanced, authored means to facilitate making and performance—typically driven by concerns of structural optimization, material use, and responsivity to environmental factors—of an atmospheric rather than social nature. At issue is the positioning of this particular manner of agency solely with the architect auteur. This abruptly halts—at the moment in which fabrication commences—the ability to amend, redefine, or newly introduce fundamentally transformational constituents and their interrelationships and, most importantly, to explore the possibility for extraordinary outcomes. When the architecture becomes a functional, social, and cultural entity, in the hands of the idealized abled-bodied user, agency—especially for one of an otherly body or mind—is long gone. Even an empathetic auteur may not be able to access the motivations of the differently-abled body and neuro-divergent mind, effectively locking the constraints of the design process, which creates an exclusionary system to those beyond the purview of said auteur. It can therefore be deduced that the mechanisms or authors of a conventional computational design process cannot eradicate the exclusionary reality of an architectural system. Agency is critical, yet a more expansive terminology for agent and agency is needed. The burden to conceive of capacities that will always be highly temporal, social, unpredictable, and purposefully unknown must be shifted far from the scope of the traditional directors of the architectural system. Agency, and who it is conferred upon, must function in a manner that dissolves the distinctions between the design, the action of designing, the author of design, and those subjected to it.

N2 - CFD (Computational fluid dynamics) is a tool, through which, the entire combustion process for pulverized coal combustion (PCC) can be predicted. The solid fuel combustion modeling is not as simple as gaseous or liquid fuel combustion modeling. In the solid fuel combustion process, various physical transformations and chemical reactions occur simultaneously. Therefore in the computational modeling approach for PCC, basic physical and chemical processes such as; turbulence, radiation, devolatilization, gas-phase combustion, char reaction and soot formation/reduction are integrated to obtain the desired results. However, in order to reach the desired accuracy, different computational models should be chosen carefully. In this review, various common models that are widely used in PCC simulation are discussed scientifically along with their modeling aspects. The basic advantages and disadvantages of these models are also discussed in this study. Moreover, different models preferred by various authors for pulverized coal combustion simulation process are also summarized. From the review, it has been observed that the eddy viscosity based two-equation turbulent models and Eulerian-Lagrangian multiphase approach are mostly preferred due to better computational economy. Two competing rate devolatilization model from various finite rate models and FG-DVC devolatilization model from various phenomenological models are mostly used for PCC. Diffusion kinetic control and Intrinsic char combustion models are mostly chosen to predict the char reaction. Finite reaction rate models are preferred when the computational economy is a concern, whereas phenomenological models provide results with better accuracy because in phenomenological models realistic inputs are given as input for simulation whereas, in finite rate models, finite rate constants are mostly empirical. Most of the gas phase models are given almost equal importance. Discrete ordinate (DO) is mostly used for PCC due to its ability of volumetric radiation calculation and the ability to evaluate radiation effect on the particle phase.

N2 - Advanced non-linear dynamics, finite element computational methods and tools are utilized in order to assess the blast wave mitigation potential of the fluid–structure interaction phenomena involving rigid and deformable structures. The employed computational methods and tools are verified and validated by first demonstrating that they can quite accurately reproduce analytical solutions for a couple of well-defined blast wave propagation and interaction problems. Then the methods/tools are used to investigate the fluid–structure interaction phenomena involving deformable structures while accounting for both the interaction of the incident blast wave with the structure and for the structure-motion induced blast wave (at the back-face of the structure). To assess the role of the structure deformability, i.e. the role of the shock waves generated within the structure, the results obtained are compared with their rigid structure counterparts. This comparison established that no additional structure-deformability-related blast-mitigation effects are observed in the case of fully supported blast wave loading while, under exponentially decaying blast wave loading, such effects are observed but only under conditions when the shock wave propagation time within the structure is comparable with the incident wave decay time.

N2 - Objectives: Competent velopharyngeal (VP) function is the basis for normal speech. Understanding how VP structure influences the airflow during speech details is essential to the surgical improvement of pharyngoplasty. In this study, we aimed to illuminate the airflow features corresponding to various VP closure states using computed dynamic simulations. Methods: Three-dimensional models of the upper airways were established based on computed tomography of 8 volunteers. The velopharyngeal port was simulated by a cylinder. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were applied to illustrate the correlation between the VP port size and the airflow parameters, including the flow velocity, pressure in the velopharyngeal port, as well as the pressure in oral and nasal cavity. Results: The airflow dynamics at the velopharynx were maintained in the same velopharyngeal pattern as the area of the velopharyngeal port increased from 0 to 25 mm2. A total of 5 airflow patterns with distinct features were captured, corresponding to adequate closure, adequate/borderline closure (Class I and II), borderline/inadequate closure, and inadequate closure. The maximal orifice area that could be tolerated for adequate VP closure was determined to be 2.01 mm2. Conclusion: Different VP functions are of characteristic airflow dynamic features. Computational fluid dynamic simulation is of application potential in individualized VP surgery planning.

N2 - Several studies based on in vivo or in vitro models have found promising results for the noble gas argon in neuroprotection against ischaemic pathologies. The development of argon as a medicinal product includes the requirement for toxicity testing through non-clinical studies. The long exposure period of animals (rats) during several days results in technical and logistic challenges related to the gas administration. In particular, a minimum of 10 air changes per hour (ACH) to maintain animal welfare results in extremely large volumes of experimental gas required if the gas is not recirculated. The difficulty with handling the many cylinders prompted the development of such a recirculation-based design. To distribute the recirculating gas to individually ventilated cages and monitor them properly was deemed more difficult than constructing a single large enclosure that will hold several open cages. To address these concerns, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis of the preliminary design was performed. A purpose-made exposure chamber was designed based on the CFD simulations. Comparisons of the simulation results to measurements of gas concentration at two cage positions while filling show that the CFD results compare well to these limited experiments. Thus, we believe that the CFD results are representative of the gas distribution throughout the enclosure. The CFD shows that the design provides better gas distribution (i.e. a higher effective air change rate) than predicted by 10 ACH.

N2 - This article illustrates design-oriented human–computer interaction (HCI) research for creating do-it-yourself (DIY) experiences for emerging technologies. It contemplates the design objectives for the DIY construction processes through the lens of Ecological Approach to Smart Environments (EASE) and by exemplifying three case studies. The first case study introduces the design of the Home Control System of a nursing ecology for the aged. The second case study presents the Music Creation Tool research in music therapy ecology for those with disabilities, and the third study, Life Story Creation, presents a memory-sharing application for elderly amateur writers. The article carefully considers the role of users in HCI research, who in the DIY context are expected to be active and motivated crafters and builders of their personal environments. The focus of research, the user experience studies, aims at supporting creating, configuring and sharing experiences within the constructed prototypes, and at determining the new experiences that emerge from the research. The concluding objective for the article is presenting of a design framework for involving the initiative domain owners to the DIY research.

N2 - Background The creation and management of an autologous arteriovenous fistula (AVF) as vascular access (VA) for hemodialysis patients is still a critical procedure. The placement of a functional and long-lasting VA derives from adequate planning of the surgical procedure based on physical examination, vascular mapping and selection of the best modality for arteriovenous anastomosis. The risk of AVF non-maturation and early failure is high, even when all precautions are taken to minimize these events. In addition, AVF surgery may develop very high blood flow exposing the patient to the risk of heart failure or hand ischemia. Methods The choices of the surgeons on the modalities to perform a surgical intervention for AVF should take into consideration several factors including patient clinical condition, arterial and venous vessel sizes and elasticity. However, these evaluations cannot give direct indication on VA outcome in terms of blood flow after AVF maturation. We then took advantage of theoretical models of vascular network hemodynamics and of computational fluid dynamics to develop a numerical tool for the prediction of potential blood flow of a planned VA surgery on the basis of preoperative ultrasound evaluation of arterial and venous sizes and blood flow. Results Here we present the numerical model, previously developed and tested, and we describe the web-based application that has been developed to help during surgical planning. Conclusions The use of this tool in the clinical setting should allow to reduce the incidence of AVF non-maturation as well as incidence of VA complications.

N2 - In informal argument, an essential step is to ask what will “resonate” with a particular audience and hence persuade. Marketers, for example, may recommend a certain colour for a new soda can because it “pops” on Instagram; politicians may “fine-tune” diction for different social demographics. This paper engages the need to strategise for such resonance by offering a method for automating opposition analysis (OA), a technique from semiotics used in marketing and literary analysis to plot objects of interest on oppositional axes. Central to our computational approach is a reframing of texts as proxies for thought and opposition as the product of oscillation in thought in response to those proxies, a model to which the contextual similarity information contained in word embeddings is relevant. We illustrate our approach with an analysis of texts on gun control from ProCon.org, implementing a three-step method to: 1) identify relatively prominent signifiers; 2) rank possible opposition pairs on prominence and contextual similarity scores; and 3) derive plot values for proxies on opposition pair axes. The results are discussed in terms of strategies for informal argument that might be derived by those on each side of gun control.
