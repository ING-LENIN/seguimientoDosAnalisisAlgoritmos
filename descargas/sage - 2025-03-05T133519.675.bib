abstract = {Problem solving is a key skill in mathematics education. Thus, it is important to be able to assess students’ proficiencies as problem solvers. The Quantitative Thinking Subtest (Test Q) of the Iowa Tests of Educational Development is a test of problem solving ability. However, if this test is to be considered a pure measure of problem solving ability, it must be demonstrated that this test does not measure other factors such as computational ability. To this end, a study was designed in which two groups of students took Test Q; one group using calculators to eliminate the need for computation, and the other just using paper and pencil to solve the problems. It was found that after controlling for differences in mathematical ability, the two groups did not differ in their scores on Test Q. This result seemed to support the validity of Test Q as a test of problem solving.}

abstract = {The independence axiom in axiomatic design (AD) states that the smaller functional dependency, the better system performance. This paper aims to develop an effective and widely applicable method for uncoupling design. First, the relationships, compatibilities, and possibility of integration between AD and systematic inventive thinking (SIT) are analysed. According to the analysis, a new uncoupling method based on SIT is proposed. Next, the detailed uncoupling steps of this method are explained and a strategy to upgrade an old system or develop new systems based on an existing one is proposed in terms of this uncoupling method. Then, an example of solving vibration and noise problem of flushing facility is used to illuminate this method. Finally, a discussion of the proposed uncoupling method and the possible extension of this method with theory of inventive problem solving (TRIZ) are presented. This proposed uncoupling method is different from the conventional approaches, which avoids measuring functional dependency, harmonizing parameters, or searching substitutable technological ideas.}

abstract = {The conventional rotor spinning unit generates flow vortices in the transfer channel upstream region which affect the fiber configuration and consequently yarn properties. Geometry and spinning parameters such as transfer channel length, inlet width, rotor outlet pressure, opening roller speed, and diameter were found to be key parameters influencing airflow characteristics. To reduce the flow vortices in the upper stream region, modifications of the transfer channel were proposed, and their airflow fields were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. Three designs were studied: a round transfer channel inlet, a bypass channel for extra air supply, and one with both the bypass and the round inlet. Analysis of airflow revealed that the design with both round transfer channel inlet and a bypass proved to be very effective in properly directing the flow and minimizing vortices. The design was also characterized by smoother velocity streamlines and maximum mass flow across the transfer channel. A conventional rotor spinning unit was modified in which a round transfer channel inlet corner and a bypass channel were utilized to conduct the experimental tests. Three sets of yarn samples were produced using the conventional and modified rotor spinning units under different rotor speed conditions. Yarn properties were tested. Properties such as tenacity, CVm%, and thin and thick places of the spun yarns produced by the new design improved compared to that of the conventional yarn.}

abstract = {Piaget has distinguished a number of distinct stages in the development of the concept of an enduring external object during infancy. I present a theory of a class of behaviours at one of these stages embodied in a working computer program. The behaviour of this program matches a class of perceptual behaviours of infants between about twelve and twenty weeks of age in a number of experimental situations studied by Bower. The theory argues that these behaviours are a result of the interaction between the perceptual and conceptual levels of the system, and the way in which conflicts between competing descriptions of an object are resolved. I locate the cause of several features of the behaviours in the procedures for managing the changing representation of the world, and the system’s way of treating transitions between the states of an object (for example, moving to stationary). The basic conceptual primitives of the analysis are objects and events, not motion and place, as argued by Bower, or the infant’s previous activity, as argued by Piaget. I argue that adequate explanations of experimental findings such as these require the construction of fairly detailed computational models.}

abstract = {A recovery monitoring system, based on hybrid computational intelligent techniques, is presented for post anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injured/reconstructed subjects. The case based reasoning methodology has been combined with fuzzy and neuro-fuzzy techniques in order to develop a knowledge base and a learning model for classification of recovery stages and monitoring the progress of ACL-reconstructed subjects during the convalescence regimen. The system records kinematics and neuromuscular parameters from lower limbs of healthy and ACL-reconstructed subjects using body-mounted wireless sensors and a combined feature set is generated by performing data transformation and feature reduction techniques. In order to classify the recovery stage of subjects, fuzzy k-nearest neighbor technique and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system have been applied and results have been compared. The system was successfully tested on a group of healthy and post-operated athletes for analyzing their performance during ambulation and single leg balance testing activities. A semi-automatic process has been employed for case adaptation and retention, requiring input from the physiotherapists and physiatrists. The system can be utilized by physiatrists, physiotherapists, sports trainers and clinicians for multiple purposes including maintaining athletes’ profile, monitoring progress of recovery, classifying recovery status, adapting recovery protocols and predicting athletes’ sports performance}
