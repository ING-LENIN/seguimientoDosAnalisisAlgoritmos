N2 - Heart failure is a major health risk, and with limited availability of donor organs, there is an increasing need for developing cardiac assist devices (CADs). Mock circulatory loops (MCL) are an important in-vitro test platform for CAD’s performance assessment and optimisation. The MCL is a lumped parameter model constructed out of hydraulic and mechanical components aiming to simulate the native cardiovascular system (CVS) as closely as possible. Further development merged MCLs and numerical circulatory models to improve flexibility and accuracy of the system; commonly known as hybrid MCLs. A total of 128 MCLs were identified in a literature research until 25 September 2020. It was found that the complexity of the MCLs rose over the years, recent MCLs are not only capable of mimicking the healthy and pathological conditions, but also implemented cerebral, renal and coronary circulations and autoregulatory responses. Moreover, the development of anatomical models made flow visualisation studies possible. Mechanical MCLs showed excellent controllability and repeatability, however, often the CVS was overly simplified or lacked autoregulatory responses. In numerical MCLs the CVS is represented with a higher order of lumped parameters compared to mechanical test rigs, however, complex physiological aspects are often simplified. In hybrid MCLs complex physiological aspects are implemented in the hydraulic part of the system, whilst the numerical model represents parts of the CVS that are too difficult to represent by mechanical components per se. This review aims to describe the advances, limitations and future directions of the three types of MCLs.

N2 - A singly phenoxido-bridged dinuclear Cu∥ complex, [Cu2(L)2(SCN)2(H2O)], has been obtained from a Schiff-base ligand (2-[{[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]imino}methyl]-6-methoxyphenol), generated by condensation of o-vanillin with N,N-dimethylethane-1,2-diamine. The Cu(II) complex has been fully characterised by analytical, spectroscopic, magnetic susceptibility and EPR measurements and DFT calculations, as well as single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. It consists of two geometrically distinct square-pyramidal and octahedral copper(II) centres, exhibiting N2O3 and N4O2 donor sets. In the dimeric unit, the copper atoms are connected by a μ2-phenolato oxygen atom, belonging to one bridging Schiff-base ligand. Variable-temperature magnetic susceptibility measurements indicate strong antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the Cu(II) centres, with a 2J value of −89(1) cm−1.

N2 - This article functions as the introduction to the Themed Issue on Archaeologies of Fashion Film. The text introduces fashion film as a genre and as an historically dynamic form of audiovisual expression that we approach through fashion history, media archaeology and new film history. While introducing key concepts and approaches, the authors propose a form of ‘parallax historiography’, a term emerging from Thomas Elsaesser’s work, that links different time periods from early cinema to recent digital platforms, even ‘post-cinema’. The introduction makes references to the contributions in this issue that address historical conditions of emergence, marginal voices in the historical record and unexcavated archival materials; and the issue shows how they all contain feedback loops or recursive traits that resonate in contemporary practice where infrastructures of platforms and data frame the moving image.

N2 - This paper explores the use of both macroscale and microscale modelling for the analysis of extrusion of an AA2009 + 25%SiCp metal matrix composite (MMC). The performance of a micromechanical model, where the heterogeneous microstructure of the MMC is explicitly modelled, in predicting the tensile stress—strain behaviour of an AA2009 + 25% SiCp MMC is examined. A macroscale modelling approach is used to simulate extrusion of the MMC through two different die designs, where the MMC is modelled as a homogeneous continuum. Firstly, the extrusion results are used to compare the two die designs, to determine which is the more favourable. Secondly, the predicted macroscale plastic strain distributions and pressures are used with the micromechanical model to assess microscale stress states in the material during extrusion with a view to gaining insights into the risk of damage in the material. In this context, pressure is shown to be hugely important in controlling tensile stress magnitude and in reducing microscale damage risk, and essentially ensuring that extrusion can be achieved in practice. However, the results reveal that damage risk is not totally eliminated and that there may still be locations where the material may rupture.

N2 - Numerical analysis provides an opportunity to solve complex problems using mathematical models. The increasing trend of numerical simulations supports many industries and research organisations to reduce the experimental work. In the present study, considering the positive aspects of numerical analysis, investigations have been done using different failure criteria on the carbon fibre/epoxy composites. Various failure criteria have been discussed that can be used for unidirectional and bidirectional fibre reinforced polymer composites. In this study, the best-suited failure criteria, i.e. Maximum stress, Tsai-Wu and Hashin criteria were combined with the progressive damage analysis to investigate the failure of bidirectional woven carbon fiber/epoxy polymer composites. The experimental validations were also done for numerical predictions. It was found that the Hashin failure criterion gave the results closest to the experimental failure analysis of pin joints. In pin joints prepared from carbon fiber/epoxy composite laminates, Hashin failure criteria predicted the increment in ultimate failure loads in the range of 12–16% for higher values of width to diameter (W/D) and edge to diameter (E/D) ratios. For pin joints prepared from multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) added carbon fiber/epoxy composite laminates, the prediction given by Hashin failure criteria was in the range of 15–19%.

N2 - The purpose of this article is twofold: to theoretically assess ideational and organizational explanatory factors in the adoption of artificial intelligence policies; and to examine the extent to which the European Union has managed to facilitate a coordinated artificial intelligence policy in the Nordic countries. The study utilizes a mixed-methods approach based on systematic web searching, systematic policy document analysis and key informant semi-structured interviews. The study finds that the European Union has utilized framing-based strategies to set an agenda for a coordinated European artificial intelligence policy. Moreover, the strategy has affected member-state artificial intelligence policies to the extent that key tenets of European Union artificial intelligence discourse have penetrated Nordic public documents. However, the extent to which the Nordic countries incorporate European Union artificial intelligence policy discourse diverges at the national level. Differentiated national organizational capacities among Nordic countries make the adoption of artificial intelligence policies divergent. This observation is theoretically accounted for through a conversation between organizational theory of public governance and discursive institutionalism. The study argues that the framing of European Union artificial intelligence policies is filtered through organizational structures among states. Points for practitioners The study illuminates how policymakers in the Nordic countries are affected by the European Union when crafting their own artificial intelligence policies. The European Commission profoundly influences the policymaking of member states and affiliated states through the policy strategy of policy framing. The Commission uses this soft measure to nudge member states to comply with the European Union policy framework. Second, the study shows how ‘organizations matter’: variation in national organizational capacities in the Nordic states contributes to variation in national policy adoption. Even though Nordic countries adopt European Union-level policy frames, their implementation is shaped by varying organizational capacities available at the national level.

N2 - Evaluation of cell response to mechanical stimuli at in vitro conditions is known as one of the important issues for modulating cell behavior. Mechanical stimuli, including mechanical vibration and oscillatory fluid flow, act as important biophysical signals for the mechanical modulation of stem cells. In the present study, mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) consists of cytoplasm, nucleus, actin, and microtubule. Also, integrin and primary cilium were considered as mechanoreceptors. In this study, the combined effect of vibration and oscillatory fluid flow on the cell and its components were investigated using numerical modeling. The results of the FEM and FSI model showed that the cell response (stress and strain values) at the frequency of mechanical vibration has the highest value. The achieved results on shear stress caused by the fluid flow on the cell showed that the cell experiences shear stress in the range of . Mechanoreceptors that bind separately to the cell surface, can be highly stimulated by hydrodynamic pressure and, therefore, can play a role in the mechanical modulation of MSCs at in vitro conditions. The results of this research can be effective in future studies to optimize the conditions of mechanical stimuli applied to the cell culture medium and to determine the mechanisms involved in mechanotransduction.

N2 - This paper discusses the implications of the sciences of complexity for public policy and administration. It is argued that the sciences of complexity have implications for our thinking in mainly three areas. First, they revise our conceptions of systems, causal relations, and determinism and depict a picture of mostly indeterministic reality composed of open systems. Second, they offer an “endophysical” and phenomenological view of system - observer relations. Third, although they are heavily quantitative, they illustrate the importance of qualitative interpretations in quantitative analyses and thus bridge the chasm between quantitative and qualitative methodologies. The insights of the sciences of complexity can help us improve our understanding of the complexities of public policy and administrative processes.

N2 - In this study, the corrosion behavior of biodegradable composites is modeled. These composites are made of Poly-Lactic acid and Magnesium with different volume fractions. The scanning electron microscopy images of these composites were taken, and statistical reconstruction of the composite based on scanning electron microscopy images was done by the phase recovery algorithm, the three-dimensional structure of this composite was extracted with this reconstruction, then a three-dimensional cellular automata model was developed to predict the corrosion of this composite. Results of experiments for the composite with 10% of Magnesium volume fraction were used to calibrate the parameters of the cellular automata model, and with these parameters, the results for the composite with 5% of Magnesium volume fraction was obtained, and with comparing these data with the results of the experiment, our model was validated. In the end, we estimated the mechanical properties of these composites and analyzed the results.
