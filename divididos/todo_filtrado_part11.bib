abstract = {This chapter summarizes the results of a series of correlational, experimental, and case studies on Cognitively Guided Instruction (CGI), a program designed to help teachers understand children's thinking and use this knowledge to make instructional decisions. Results of the studies show that teachers' knowledge and beliefs about students' thinking are related to students' achievement. There were significant differences between CGI classes and control classes on the emphasis on problem solving and low level skills, the freedom given to students to construct their own strategies for solving problems, the teachers' knowledge of their students thinking, and the students' achievement in both problem solving and skills.}

abstract = {Life scientists today cannot hope to read everything relevant to their research. Emerging text-mining tools can help by identifying topics and distilling statements from books and articles with increased accuracy. Researchers often organize these statements into ontologies, consistent systems of reality claims. Like scientific thinking and interchange, however, text-mined information (even when accurately captured) is complex, redundant, sometimes incoherent, and often contradictory: it is rooted in a mixture of only partially consistent ontologies. We review work that models scientific reason and suggest how computational reasoning across ontologies and the broader distribution of textual statements can assess the certainty of statements and the process by which statements become certain. With the emergence of digitized data regarding networks of scientific authorship, institutions, and resources, we explore the possibility of accounting for social dependences and cultural biases in reasoning models. Computational reasoning is starting to fill out ontologies and flag internal inconsistencies in several areas of bioscience. In the not too distant future, scientists may be able to use statements and rich models of the processes that produced them to identify underexplored areas, resurrect forgotten findings and ideas, deconvolute the spaghetti of underlying ontologies, and synthesize novel knowledge and hypotheses.}

abstract = {Publisher Summary
Embodied cognition is an approach to cognition that has roots in motor behavior. This approach emphasizes that cognition typically involves acting with a physical body on an environment in which that body is immersed. The approach of embodied cognition postulates that understanding cognitive processes entails understanding their close link to the motor surfaces that may generate action and to the sensory surfaces that provide sensory signals about the environment. To a certain extent, the embodiment stance implies a mistrust of the abstraction inherent in much information processing thinking, in which the interface between cognitive processes and their sensorimotor support is drawn at a level that is quite removed from both the sensory and the motor systems. New theoretical tools are needed to address cognition within the embodiment perspective. This chapter reviews one set of theoretical concepts which is believed to be particularly suited to address the constraints of embodiment and situatedness. It refers to this set of concepts as Dynamical Systems Thinking.}
