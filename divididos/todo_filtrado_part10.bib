abstract = {In the context of elections, the Internet opens new and promising possibilities for parties and candidates looking for a better political strategy and visibility. In this way they can also organize their election campaign to gather funds, to mobilize support, and to enter into a direct dialogue with the electorate. This paper presents an ongoing research of recommender systems applied on e-government, particularly it is an extension of so-called voting advice applications (VAA’s). VAA’s are Web applications that support voters, providing relevant information on candidates and political parties by comparing their political interests with parties or candidates on different political issues. Traditional VAA’s provide recommendations of political parties and candidates focusing on static profiles of users. The goal of this work is to develop a candidate profile based on different parameters, such as the perspective of voters, social network activities, and expert opinions, to construct a more accurate dynamic profile of candidates. Understanding the elements that compose a candidate profile will help citizens in the decision-making process when facing a lack of information related to the behavior and thinking of future public authorities. At the end of this work, a fuzzy-based visualization approach for a VAA design is given using as a case study the National Elections of Ecuador in 2013.}

abstract = {Acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) is a clinically significant vascular and gastrointestinal condition, which is closely related to the blood supply of the small intestine. Unfortunately, it is still challenging to properly discriminate small intestinal tissues with different degrees of ischemia. In this study, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) was used to construct pseudo-color images of oxygen saturation about small intestinal tissues and to discriminate different degrees of ischemia. First, several small intestine tissue models of New Zealand white rabbits were prepared and collected their hyperspectral data. Then, a set of isosbestic points were used to linearly transform the measurement data twice to match the reference spectra of oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin, respectively. The oxygen saturation was measured at the characteristic peak band of oxyhemoglobin (560 nm). Ultimately, using the oxygenated hemoglobin reflectance spectrum as the benchmark, we obtained the relative amount of median oxygen saturation in normal tissues was 70.0 %, the IQR was 10.1 %, the relative amount of median oxygen saturation in ischemic tissues was 49.6 %, and the IQR was 14.6 %. The results demonstrate that HSI combined with the oxygen saturation computation method can efficiently differentiate between normal and ischemic regions of the small intestinal tissues. This technique provides a powerful support for internist to discriminate small bowel tissues with different degrees of ischemia, and also provides a new way of thinking for the diagnosis of AMI.}

While thinking aloud, 21 teachers judged their fourth grade students' (n = 176) decimal magnitude understanding. Sensitivity (correctly judging what students did understand) did not improve from availability of both answer cues (students' answers to prior practice problems) and student cues (knowledge of students triggered by knowing their names), and was lower when only answer cues were available, compared to only student cues. Specificity (correctly judging what students did not understand) was higher when only answer cues were available, compared to only student cues or both student and answer cues.}

abstract = {Along with the process of building China's modern vocational education system, China's higher vocational education has made great progress. With the development of computer and Internet technology, gamified learning, as a new way of learning, combines the advantages of computer games and online learning, which not only meets the needs of people to learn anytime and anywhere, but also increases the fun of learning activities. In this paper, we developed a gamified learning software with traveler-type problems as the research content, through the interaction with the game, so that students can think in the game and learn knowledge through the game. Through the questionnaire for research and analysis, this game is good game fun and can stimulate learning interest well. In addition, this paper carries out an in-depth study of the game's help system, optimizes the algorithm for the help system, and proposes an improved genetic algorithm. The reverse learning method is adopted to improve the accuracy and convergence speed of the optimal solution; then the Metropolis criterion is used to improve the crossover and mutation operators to enhance the local search ability of the algorithm; finally, the concept of realistic elite learning is introduced to further enhance the local search ability of the algorithm. The simulation results show that the algorithm is effectively improved in convergence performance and solution accuracy, which can significantly improve the response speed of the help system, effectively improve the game's fun, and improve the game's playability.}

abstract = {The last three decades of research in human cognitive neuroscience have given us an initial “parts list” for the human mind in the form of a set of cortical regions with distinct and often very specific functions. But current neuroscientific methods in humans have limited ability to reveal exactly what these regions represent and compute, the causal role of each in behavior, and the interactions among regions that produce real-world cognition. Animal models can help to answer these questions when homologues exist in other species, like the face system in macaques. When homologues do not exist in animals, for example for speech and music perception, and understanding of language or other people's thoughts, intracranial recordings in humans play a central role, along with a new alternative to animal models: artificial neural networks.}

Where to apply to graduate school or a postdoc, and why? With whom should you work? A PhD or a PharmD, and to postdoc or not? What must you do to be successful? Moreover, we touch on traits important to becoming an independent researcher and ask whether success in graduate school or a postdoctoral fellowship requires different skills than undergraduate degrees. Critical thinking habits and skills underpin this discussion. We outline possible career choices, touching on the knowledge and expertise used by drug hunters, and also ask what might be of most value to potential employers. Each of us is different, and what's best for you is something you will have to decipher, but hopefully only after you consult with family, friends, and advisors or mentors. Regardless, “the big leap” is coming, so get ready.}
