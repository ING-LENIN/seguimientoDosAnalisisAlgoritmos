abstract = {Transformative Organizational Change becomes more and more significant both practically and academically, especially in the context of organizational culture and learning. However computational modeling and a formalization of organizational change and learning processes are still largely unexplored. This paper aims to provide an adaptive network model of transformative organizational change and translate a selection of organizational learning and change processes into computationally modelled processes. Additionally, it sets out to connect the dynamic systems view of organizations to self-modelling network models. The creation of the model and the implemented mechanisms of organizational processes are based on extrapolations of an extensive literature study and grounded in related work in this field, and then applied to a specified hospital-related case scenario in the context of safety culture. The model was evaluated by running several simulations and variations thereof. The results of these were investigated by qualitative analysis and comparison to expected emergent behaviour based on related available academic literature. The simulations performed confirmed the occurrence of an organizational transformational change towards a constant learning culture by offering repeated and effective learning and changes to organizational processes. Observations about various interplays and effects of the mechanism have been made, and they exposed that acceptance of mistakes as a part of learning culture facilitates transformational change and may foster sustainable change in the long run. Further, the model confirmed that the self-modelling network model approach applies to a dynamic systems view of organizations and a systems perspective of organizational change. The created model offers the basis for the further creation of self-modelling network models within the field of transformative organizational change and the translated mechanisms of this model can further be extracted and reused in a forthcoming academic exploration of this field.}

abstract = {The most important design parameters of each phase-locked loop (PLL) are the local and global stability properties, and the pull-in range. To extend the pull-in range, engineers often use type 2 PLLs. However, the engineering design relies on approximations which prevent a full exploitation of the benefits of type 2 PLLs. Using an exact mathematical model and relying on a rigorous mathematical thinking this problem is revisited here and the stability and pull-in properties of the third-order type 2 analog PLLs are determined. Both the local and global stability conditions are derived. As a new idea, the harmonic balance method is used to derive the global stability conditions. That approach offers an extra advantage, the birth of unwanted oscillations can be also predicted. As a verification it is shown that the sufficient conditions of global stability derived by the harmonic balance method proposed here and the well-known direct Lyapunov approach coincide with each other, moreover, the harmonic balance predicts the birth of oscillations in the gap between the local and global stability conditions. Finally, an example when the conditions for local and global stability coincide, is considered.}

It is an interrelated discipline that needs to be applied at all stages of the drug development process to appropriately characterise the safety profile of a drug compound and acknowledge the uncertainties associated with models available. With a strategic mindset, the preclinical safety activities aim to build a comprehensive profile of the drug so that potential hazards can be identified and the risks for healthy trial subjects or patients quantified, and, if necessary, suitable means for eliminating or reducing unacceptable risks can be put in place. We focus on the 2 distinct phases of pharmaceutical toxicology:  Discovery toxicology and regulatory toxicology, to explain how the thinking is built upon at each stage and how the mindset shifts from enabling the selection of an optimally derisked clinical candidate through to thorough risk characterisation and management of those risks for clinical development. Considering attrition due to safety reasons, whether clinical or preclinical, is one of the main reasons for drug project failure, safety assessments should be viewed with equal importance as drug efficacy assessments.}

Neuromorphic photonics, the implementation of neuromorphic information processing with optoelectronic hardware, is a new computational paradigm based on photons aiming to achieve brain-like information processing in the optical domain, and an interdisciplinary field that is expanding in a multitude of directions.

abstract = {The large-scale buffer allocation problem (LBAP) in production lines represents a significant optimization challenge, centered on the efficient allocation of limited temporary storage areas. Prior research has predominantly addressed the LBAP through dynamic programming, search algorithms, and metaheuristics. However, these methodologies are often problem-specific and inefficient when applied to large-scale scenarios. Consequently, there is a pressing need to investigate innovative algorithms beyond existing approaches. This paper presents a novel learning and knowledge-guided evolutionary algorithm designed for the LBAP in production lines. The proposed algorithm develops an adaptive genetic algorithm and a variable neighborhood search algorithm, incorporating a simulated annealing-based strategy. An online Q-learning algorithm is employed to dynamically select the more effective of the two preceding algorithms for solution updates, while the simulated annealing-based strategy regulates the acceptance of these updated solutions. Furthermore, The proposed algorithm dynamically adjusts crossover, mutation, and shaking rates to adapt to the neighborhood structure. It also leverages conflict knowledge obtained from prior update experiences to inform the search process, thereby enhancing solution quality and computational efficiency. Numerical results indicate that the proposed algorithm surpasses state-of-the-art methods in addressing the LBAP. Additionally, empirical ablation studies demonstrate that the knowledge-guided approach efficiently explores promising solution regions by eliminating low-value solutions, while the learning-guided approach effectively generates improved solutions by selecting optimal strategies. This proposed algorithm significantly advances dynamic production resource allocation in large-scale systems.}

Dennett's intentional stance offers an analogous abstraction for computational agents seeking to understand, explain, or predict others' behaviors. These recognized theories provide a formal basis to ongoing investigations of recursive modeling. We review and situate various frameworks for recursive modeling that have been studied in game- and decision- theories, and have yielded methods useful to AI researchers. Sustained attention given to these frameworks has produced new analyses and methods with an aim toward making recursive modeling practicable. Indeed, we also review some emerging uses and the insights these yielded, which are indicative of pragmatic progress in this area. The significance of these frameworks is that higher-order reasoning is critical to correctly recognizing others' intent or outthinking opponents. Such reasoning has been utilized in academic, business, military, security, and other contexts both to train and inform decision-making agents in organizational and strategic contexts, and also to more realistically predict and best respond to other agents' intent.}

abstract = {The random finite difference method (RFDM) is a popular approach to quantitatively evaluate the influence of inherent spatial variability of soil on the deformation of embedded tunnels. However, the high computational cost is an ongoing challenge for its application in complex scenarios. To address this limitation, a deep learning-based method for efficient prediction of tunnel deformation in spatially variable soil is proposed. The proposed method uses one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN) to identify the pattern between random field input and factor of safety of tunnel deformation output. The mean squared error and correlation coefficient of the CNN model applied to the newly untrained dataset was less than 0.02 and larger than 0.96, respectively. It means that the trained CNN model can replace RFDM analysis for Monte Carlo simulations with a small but sufficient number of random field samples (about 40 samples for each case in this study). It is well known that the machine learning or deep learning model has a common limitation that the confidence of predicted result is unknown and only a deterministic outcome is given. This calls for an approach to gauge the model's confidence interval. It is achieved by applying dropout to all layers of the original model to retrain the model and using the dropout technique when performing inference. The excellent agreement between the CNN model prediction and the RFDM calculated results demonstrated that the proposed deep learning-based method has potential for tunnel performance analysis in spatially variable soils.}

abstract = {Stacking fault (SF), originating from the emission of partial dislocations, wields significant influence over the structural and physicochemical traits of ceramic materials. Yet, the intricate atomic dynamics driving SF nucleation remain obscured. Here, we introduce an improved methodology for computing the generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) in ceramics, integrating uneven Degrees of Freedom (DOFs) for distinct lattice sites. This refinement has yielded substantial energy advantages over the traditional rigid shift method inherited from metallic systems. Our findings underscore that the relaxation of nonmetallic N atoms within the SF region is pivotal for achieving a more realistic SF simulation. This, in turn, unveils the involvement of N atom migration within the SF region between different aluminum tetrahedral sites during SF nucleation. By alleviating the energy barrier, this relaxation contrasts with previous simulations where nonmetallic elements remained more rigid. This work demonstrates the atomic dynamics of SF nucleation in ceramics and breaks the conventional wisdom of uniformly applying constraints for GSFE computations.}

We offer a new explanation for this effect, the counterfactual explanation: people judge actions to be more causal than inactions because they are more inclined to consider the counterfactual alternatives to actions than to consider counterfactual alternatives to inactions. Experiment 1a conceptually replicates the original action effect for causal judgments. Experiment 1b confirms a novel prediction of the new explanation, the reverse action effect, in which people judge inactions to be more causal than actions in overdetermination cases. Experiment 2 directly compares the two effects in joint-causation and overdetermination scenarios and conceptually replicates them with new scenarios. Taken together, these studies provide support for the new counterfactual explanation for the action effect in causal judgment.}

We first reflected on the semantics attached to these methods. We then conducted a comparative analysis on the way the articulation of quantitative and qualitative methods was conducted, based on an in-depth analysis of a set of eleven anticipatory projects completed by several external case studies. We propose insights to classify projects according to the timing (successive, iterative or convergent) and the purpose of the articulation (imagination, refinement, assessment and awareness raising). We use these insights to explore methodological implications and power relationships and then discuss the ways to inform or frame anticipatory projects that seek to combine these methods.}
