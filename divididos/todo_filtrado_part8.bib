This chapter presents three-level introduction to the field of matrix computations. The chapter discusses analytic and computational tools that underpin numerical linear algebra. Low dimension examples are the rule with appropriate generalizations to follow. The central themes include (a) the language of matrix factorizations, (b) the art of introducing zeros into a matrix, (c) the exploitation of structure, and (d) the distinction between problem sensitivity and algorithmic stability. Matrix factorizations that play a central role in numerical linear algebra are also presented in the chapter. The chapter also discusses factorization. For each factorization, algorithms are surveyed, associated mathematical properties, and applications are discussed. One factorization (Chotesky) is used to illustrate various aspects of high performance matrix computations. Successful computing requires the design of codes that pay careful attention to the flow of data during execution.}

Given the absence of benchmark Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) datasets on Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) created by LLMs, we employed various LLMs (e.g., Vicuna-13B, Bard, and GPT-3.5) to generate MCQs on STEM topics curated from Wikipedia. We evaluated open-source LLM models such as Llama 2-7B and Mistral-7B Instruct, along with an encoder model such as DeBERTa v3 Large, on inference by adding context in addition to fine-tuning with and without context. The results showed that DeBERTa v3 Large and Mistral-7B Instruct outperform Llama 2-7B, highlighting the potential of LLMs with fewer parameters in answering hard MCQs when given the appropriate context through fine-tuning. We also benchmarked the results of these models against closed-source models such as Gemini and GPT-4 on inference with context, showcasing the potential of narrowing the gap between open-source and closed-source models when context is provided. Our work demonstrates the capabilities of LLMs in creating more challenging tasks that can be used as self-evaluation for other models. It also contributes to understanding LLMs’ capabilities in STEM MCQs tasks and emphasizes the importance of context for LLMs with fewer parameters in enhancing their performance.}

abstract = {In the current era marked by an unprecedented abundance of data, the usage of conventional methods such as kriging persists in some applications of geostatistics, despite their limitations in adequately capturing the intricate relationships found in contemporary, multivariate datasets. Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in capturing complex nonlinear feature relationships across various domains, their success in geostatistical applications has been limited. This can be partly attributed to two significant challenges. Firstly, the opaque nature of these black box models raises concerns about the dependability of their outputs for critical decision-making, as the inner workings of the model remain less interpretable. Secondly, DNNs do not explicitly capture spatial dependencies within data. To address these shortcomings, we employ a methodology to interpret the recently proposed spatial DNNs known as Deepkriging, and we apply it to dry bulk rock density estimation, an often-overlooked aspect in mineral resource estimation. Through our adaptation of Shapley values—Batched Shapley—we overcome significant computational challenges to quantify feature importance for Deepkriging. This approach takes into account feature interactions, which is crucial for DNNs, as they rely on high-order interactions, especially in a complex application like mineral resource estimation. Additionally, we demonstrate in the 3D case that Deepkriging outperforms ordinary kriging and regression kriging in terms of mean squared errors, in both the purely spatial case and in the presence of auxiliary variables. Our study produces the first methodology to interpret Deepkriging, which is suitable for any model with a large number of features; it reaffirms the efficacy of Deepkriging through several comparisons in a 3D application, and most importantly; it underscores the adaptability and broader potential of DNNs to cater to various challenges in geostatistics.}

A review of these tools reveals a continuing endeavor to incorporate in the procedures the systems and life cycle thinking and the triple bottom-line framework of sustainable development (economic, social, and environmental). Over time, the CE tools have been modified with the incorporation of some unique attributes in the cases being studied. Life cycle assessment (LCA) remains the popular and the only standardized procedure to analyze CE issues in industries, specifically in the environmental aspect. However, consistency, measurement, and aggregation issues are the major setbacks of having an integrated LCA for economic, social, and environmental impacts. The alternative tools used across the world to study the economic, social, and environmental aspects of CE have increased in both number and sophistication. Optimization and systems models have been increasingly used on a case-based format. Although the downside is the less standardized approach with less chances of comparability in terms of results, these models have been designed appropriately to tackle challenges associated with intricate, multifaceted, and encompassing sustainability and CE issues to improve policy development. In the textile industry, LCA as a popular tool is only used for environmental sustainability assessment but not much in social and economic aspects. The Philippine textile industry still has to catch up in the application of those tools for sustainability assessment. A framework has been suggested for the country's roadmap/guide to attain circularity in textile industry operations.}

Genome-wide association (GWA) studies of schizophrenia confirmed that 108 loci harbouring over 300 genes were associated with schizophrenia. Although the functional implications of genetic variants are unclear, theoretical functional alterations of these genes could be replicated by the presence of autoantibodies. This study examined the levels of plasma IgG antibodies against four neurotransmitter receptors, CHRM4, GRM3, CHRNA4 and CHRNA5, using an in-house ELISA in 247 patients with schizophrenia and 344 non-psychiatric controls. Four peptides were designed based on in silico analysis with computational prediction of HLA-DRB1 restricted and B-cell epitopes. The relationship between plasma IgG levels and psychiatric symptoms, as defined by the Operational Criteria Checklist for Psychotic Illness and Affective Illness (OPCRIT), were examined. The results showed that the levels of plasma IgG against peptides derived from CHRM4 and CHRNA4 were significantly increased in patients with schizophrenia compared with control subjects, but there was no significant association of plasma IgG levels with any symptom domain or any specific symptoms. These preliminary results suggest that CHRM4 and CHRNA4 may be novel targets for autoantibody responses in schizophrenia, although the pathogenic relationship between increased serum autoantibody levels and schizophrenia symptoms remains unclear.}

abstract = {The cross-frequency coupling relationship of EEG signals is of great significance to identify abnormal EEG signals and diagnose diseases. This paper proposes a new algorithm, CEEMDAN (complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise)-based cross-frequency symbolic convergent cross mapping (CEEMDAN CF-SCCM). In the numerical simulation test, we have confirmed that CEEMDAN CF-SCCM is an effective method to quantify the cross-frequency information transmission of complex system signals from the three dimensions of robustness to noise, coupling sensitivity, and data length sensitivity. It can successfully distinguish the driving factors and response factors in the phase–amplitude interaction and has good robustness to noise. With this approach, we examined differences in cross-frequency phase–amplitude coupling between ADHD patients and normal individuals over classical brain frequency bands (Alpha, Beta, Delta, Gamma, Theta). According to the position of the electrodes, the brain was divided into four regions: front, back, left, and right, and the phase–amplitude coupling between different frequencies in each region was compared. Compared with the normal group, there was more information transmission in the anterior region of Delta waves and Theta waves. The front and left sides of the brain are responsible for thinking, mental and auditory functions. This information helps us gain insight into the brain dynamics of ADHD patients and contributes to the diagnosis of the disease.}

Pure anarthria (different from mutism) and verbal short-term memory deficits are associated with an impairment of the effect of covert speech on the content of working memory. Dynamic aphasia impairs the processes involved in the transition between thinking and speaking. However, even the most severe agrammatic patients can retain reasoning about others’ beliefs that according to some theories can only take place in explicit sentences of a natural language. Error monitoring is also impaired in many aphasic patients and in some of them is associated with complete lack of error awareness (anosognosia for aphasia). In patients with impaired consciousness whenever language examination is impossible or unreliable, fMRI and neurophysiological measures such as event-related potentials can provide a window for examining residual language capabilities.}

Previous research has suggested that humans may be the only species capable of abstract knowledge formation, but this remains controversial. There is also mixed evidence for when this ability emerges over human development. Kemp et al. (2007) proposed a computational model of how overhypotheses could be learned from sparse examples. We provide the first direct test of this model: an ecologically valid paradigm for testing two species, capuchin monkeys (Sapajus spp.) and 4- to 5-year-old human children. We presented participants with sampled evidence from different containers which suggested that all containers held items of uniform type (type condition) or of uniform size (size condition). Subsequently, we presented two new test containers and an example item from each: a small, high-valued item and a large but low-valued item. Participants could then choose from which test container they would like to receive the next sample – the optimal choice was the container that yielded a large item in the size condition or a high-valued item in the type condition. We compared performance to a priori predictions made by models with and without the capacity to learn overhypotheses. Children's choices were consistent with the model predictions and thus suggest an ability for abstract knowledge formation in the preschool years, whereas monkeys performed at chance level.}

Journal of Second Language Writing 4(2), 139–155) has shown that these subjective judgements are influenced to a very large extent by the lexical choices made by candidates. We took Engber's basic model, but automated the evaluation of lexical content. A group of non-native speakers of French were asked to produce a short text in response to a picture stimulus. The texts were graded by French native speaker teachers. We identified a number of words which occurred in about half the texts, and coded each text for the occurrence and non-occurrence of each word. We then trained a neural network to grade the texts on the basis of these codings. The results suggest that it might be possible to teach a neural network to mimic the judgements made by human markers.}

The aim is to assess the effects of the flux barrier on the main properties of a permanent magnet synchronous motor. Also, robust design analysis is presented on the flux barrier. The computational burden of the robust design analysis is immense, even if uniform uncertainties are assumed. In this case, different Design of Experiment (DoE) methods reduce the number of simulations. The efficiency of the DoE methods is compared in terms of simulation number and extreme value approximation. We found that the Central Composite method is the most accurate, while the Plackett–Burman is the most efficient in this particular case.}

By utilizing Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to find the optimal solution and incorporating Chance-Constrained Programming (CCP) to handle uncertainties in renewable energy generation and EV loads, this framework addresses the complexities of modern energy systems. The study employs Monte Carlo (MC) to simulate the EV load profile, applies K-means clustering to categorize load and renewable generation patterns, and uses a Sigmoid function-based model for Real-Time Pricing (RTP). The combination of PSO and CCP is used to optimize the system’s operating strategy. This evaluates the system’s economic benefits and impact on carbon emissions by analyzing different scenarios, such as weekdays versus weekends and various weather conditions (sunny, cloudy, rainy). The results show that due to the high price of hydrogen, it is currently costly to replace hydrogen completely. However, this integrated approach not only improves energy efficiency and reduces carbon footprint but also ensures system reliability under uncertain conditions, contributing to broader environmental sustainability.}

Demographic information, social problem-solving deficits, as well as depressive/anxiety symptoms and stress levels were assessed at baseline. Social rejection and negative affect were assessed using ecological momentary assessment over the following 28 days. Dynamic structural equation modeling was used to assess relations among study variables. After accounting for depressive/anxiety symptoms, stress levels, sex, and age, only avoidance of problems bolstered the real-time positive relation between social rejection severity and negative affect (b = 0.04, 95% credibility interval [0.003, 0.072]). Individuals with suicidal ideation who possess an avoidant problem-solving style may be particularly likely to experience heightened negative affect following social rejection and may benefit from instruction in problem-solving skills.}

abstract = {The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) is capable of accurate positioning because it can provide high-precision data. These data are transmitted to the receiver in the form of navigation messages, called civil navigation messages (CNAV). As it is transmitted in an open, transparent environment without data integrity protection mechanisms and secure data transmission measures, the CNAV is suspected to spoofing attacks. In 2023, the OPSGROUP has received approximately 50 reports of GPS spoofing activity. A spoofed plane's navigation system will show it as being in a different place - a security risk if a jet is guided to fly into a hostile country's airspace. To prevent the forging of GNSS positioning data by spoofing attacks targeting CNAV, we propose a certificateless aggregation authentication for CNAV by using the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem and the combination of the GNAV structural characteristics, called TrustCNAV. Security proof and performance analysis indicate that this authentication scheme can resist spoofing attacks and ensure data security of CNAV, also it avoids pairing operations with high computational complexity, thus meeting security requirements without causing too much time and communication consumption.}

abstract = {Many researchers in different disciplines have independently concluded that brains are, possibly among other things, vector processing devices. In this paper we offer support for this hypothesis coming from a new perspective. Namely, we test it against some known anomalies in the processing by schizophrenic patients of certain logical tasks: they perform better at them than normal controls, despite the observation that they do not generally employ “normal” or “commonsense” logic. On the assumption that they are compelled to use the intrinsic logic of the brain instead of commonsense logic, and that this logic is linear or quantum-like, we are able to resolve these and other anomalies. Our conclusions support the idea that human brains (at least) perform intrinsic logical operations according to the dictates of a linear (or Grassmannian, or quantum-like) logic rather than “classical” or Aristotelian logic (which seems not to be intrinsic to brains, these having evolved under the pressure of different constraints). If this is the case, then commonsense logic must be acquired through experience and the construction of contexts, an ability schizophrenic patients seem to lack, and who are consequently compelled to rely on the intrinsic logic, which is quantum-like and more efficient at certain tasks. Moreover, the proclivity toward errors of von Domarus type (namely the inference that shared attributes imply identity), which seems to be endemic to human thinking and has been discussed in connection with schizophrenia, is also explained on this basis.}

K. Ider and F. M. L. Amirouche [J. appl. Mech.56, (2) (1989)]. This technique is useful with the finite element based algorithm for the solution of dynamical equations of motion for the constrained and unconstrained systems with flexible/rigid interconnected bodies. The implementation of the technique has totally eliminated the costly multiplications of large Boolean matrices, where intensive cpu utilization was required. The overall expensive computer time has been drastically reduced, particularly for the three-dimensional systems involving large degrees of freedom, as a result of their intricate geometry. The algorithmic procedure has been presented in a matrix form and is based on the recursive formulation using Kane's equation, strain energy, mode synthesis, finite element approach, a stable and efficient method for reducing the number of equations subsequent to the constraints resulting from closed loops and/or prescribed motions. Further enhancement in the speed of execution has been achieved by subjecting the developed code to vectorization on the vector-processing machine. A study of simple robot with flexible links has been presented comparing the execution times on the scalar machine (IBM-3081) and the vector-processor (IBM-3090) with and without vector options. Performance figures has been plotted demonstrating the large gains achieved by the technique developed.}

abstract = {Reflection is a key activity in self-regulated learning (SRL) and a critical part of health professions education that supports the development of effective lifelong-learning health professionals. Despite widespread use and plentiful theoretical models, empirical understanding of and support for reflection in health professions education remains limited due to simple manual assessment and rare feedback to students. Recent moves to digital reflection practices offer opportunities to computationally study and support reflection as a part of SRL. The critical task in such an endeavor, and the goal of this paper, is to align high-level reflection qualities that are valued conceptually with low-level features in the data that are possible to extract computationally. This paper approaches this goal by (a) developing a unified framework for conceptualizing reflection analytics in health professions education and (b) empirically examining potential data features through which these elements can be assessed. Synthesizing the prior literature yields a conceptual framework for health professions reflection comprised of six elements: Description, Analysis, Feelings, Perspective, Evaluation, and Outcome. These elements then serve as the conceptual grounding for the computational analysis in which 27 dental students’ reflections (in six reflective statement types) over the course of 4 years were examined using selected LIWC (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) indices. Variation in elements of reflection across students, years, and reflection-types supports use of the multi-dimensional analysis framework to (a) increase precision of research claims; (b) evaluate whether reflection activities are engaged in as intended; and (c) diagnose aspects of reflection in which specific students need support. Implications for the development of health professions reflection analytics that can contribute to SRL and promising areas for future research are discussed.}
